Gold price prediction today: Will gold prices continue to rise ahead of Diwali? Why investors should buy on dips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-india-where-is-gold-silver-rate-headed-on-october-08-2025-mcx-gold-futures-outlook/articleshow/124376136.cms,"Gold continued to surge to new record heights crossing $4,000 per ounce in Comex markets. (AI image)

Gold prices are likely to continue rising ahead of Diwali, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. He shares his views and recommendations for gold investors:

Gold Price Outlook

Weekly View: Bullish Bias to persist (for 1- 2 weeks perspective)

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price prediction today:Gold continued to surge to new record heights crossing $4,000 per ounce in Comex markets as investors sought safety amid the US government shutdown, economic uncertainty, and expectations of further Fed rate cuts. Investors fearful of missing out on the rally also pile into the precious metal complex sparking a “FOMO” based rally in gold.The shutdown concerns in the US, which could trigger mass federal layoffs, has also raised concerns about a drag on US growth, boosting demand for safe-haven assets. Gold has jumped nearly 50% since the start of the year, supported by central bank buying, ETF inflows, a weaker dollar, and rising retail interest.The rally is particularly driven by long-term institutional buyers along with Global Central Banks rather than speculators, suggesting any pullbacks could be limited and potentially present buying opportunities. Markets are now pricing in two Fed rate cuts by year-end.On the physical demand front in India, Trade & Government sources have revealed that India's imports of gold & silver prices continued to nearly double in September from August, defying record high prices, as banks & jewellers rushed to build inventories ahead of festivals & escape higher taxes on imports.Higher imports by India, the world's second-biggest consumer of the precious metal, supported gold record run prices in India even as demand languished in top buyer China. In October as the Indian festive season begins, which is considered auspicious to buy gold, it is likely to witness strong retail demand from the world's second largest consumer.Market sources also revealed Indian dealers quoting a premium of as high as $ 8 - 10 per oz over official domestic prices, inclusive of 6% import and 3% sales levies in recent weeks indicating strong physical demand. Strong buying from India continued to offset the slowdown seen in China.From a technical perspective, the strong rally beyond the $3,850 per oz mark continues to surprise short term speculators/traders with new highs above $ 3,950 in spot have been printed already. That said, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is flashing overbought conditions above 80 indicating “fatigue” but weekly momentum indicators still show room for further rally in prices which might continue in coming weeks ahead of Diwali festive season. Having said that, the broader bullish trend may challenge $4,000 – 4,150 per oz on the higher side in Oct 2025.On the other hand, technically gold is “up seven consecutive weeks in a row,” a pattern that has historically preceded short-term weakness as was evident in 1979 during the same period. Gold also continues to trade almost 21 – 23 % above its 200-day moving average” & “70 – 75” % above its 200-week moving average indicating upcoming 2 – 3 weeks could see peaks occurring in Oct. month followed by a dip towards the start of November.Finally a temporary correction or even a consolidation from current levels till Nov. remains a good opportunity to go long as current yearly boom is still smaller than those of the 1970s & 2000s, suggesting further upside over the next few Quarters is certainly possible.","Gold prices likely to continue rising ahead of Diwali, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Top stock market recommendations:Ending its 4 day winning streak, Nifty softened after completing its short covering target at 25220. Given the daily candlestick price action seen for the past 2 trading days, the balance of this week can continue in consolidation between 25250 - 24750 on the lower side.While on the Bank Nifty the index faced minor profit taking from its 2 month highs, as its extended target of 56650 remains open on the upside with a support now trailing at 55700 odd. Supporting this the index has not closed below its previous day’s low despite multiple intraday dips below the same.After breaking out above its cup and handle formation on weekly charts in September, stock has done a retest on the same. Fresh momentum for a 8-10% rally can commence now, given that it has given second highest daily closing yesterday and is on track for highest ever weekly closing on charts.Having reclaimed back above its 200 DMA, BSE has also given a breakout from its sloping trendline which was in place for the past 16 weeks – from the start of this correction. Capital market stocks are facing tailwinds which could also support the ongoing technical reversal on the stock.A 16 month sloping trendline breakout has been witnessed last week on the counter on daily and weekly charts, while a retest on the same has been met. Upmove for another 8-10% upside can now resume given the sectoral flavour in the current series being played out in this market.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, the top buy calls for today are: Amber Enterprises India, BSE, and Hindustan Zinc.

Tata Capital IPO: Why has GMP crashed?

Tata Capital: Long-Term Outlook

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Capital IPO: The initial public offering of Tata Group ’s flagship financial services arm Tata Capital got a big thumbsup from brkokerages, with several positive reviews. Yet, the Grey Market Premium (GMP) has crashed to just 3%. The GMP is usually seen as an indicator of the expected listing gains.Tata Capital stands amongst India's prominent non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). The IPO offers shares at Rs 310 to Rs 326, comprising a fresh issue of Rs 6,846 crore alongside an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 8,666 crore by Tata Sons, the promoter. The subscription period concludes on October 8, with the anticipated listing on October 13.The company's robust fundamentals, varied business portfolio, and reliable parent organisation have garnered widespread appreciation from analysts, according to an ET report.Brokerages including Canara Bank Securities, Anand Rathi, BP Wealth, and Mehta Equities have endorsed it as a worthwhile long-term investment. They highlight Tata Capital's established retail and SME operations, sound asset management, and digital lending initiatives as advantageous factors in India's expanding credit sector.The conservative GMP indicates investor wariness regarding immediate returns.Market specialists point out three fundamental factors contributing to this restrained sentiment, the ET report said.Initially, the offering's valuation structure provides minimal scope for immediate appreciation. With a post-issue book value multiple of 4.2 to 4.3 times at the higher price range, Tata Capital's valuation aligns with industry counterparts such as Bajaj Finance and HDB Financial. Industry watchers note that positive aspects, including robust financial health and consistent earnings, are already reflected in the pricing.Arihant Capital Markets' Chief Strategy Officer, Shruti Jain, attributes the modest grey market premium to appropriate pricing.""At 4.2–4.3x post-money, the IPO valuations don't leave much on the table for listing gains. While the fundamentals are strong, the current market is cautious, with several growth companies facing valuation pressures. That's why the GMP hasn't picked up despite Tata Capital's sound business model,"" she explained.Additionally, the recent consolidation with Tata Motor Finance Ltd. (TMFL) has generated uncertainties regarding portfolio quality and earnings potential.Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza, pointed out that despite the merger enhancing Tata Capital's vehicle finance operations, it has temporarily elevated its gross non-performing assets (NPA) to approximately 1% from 0.5%.""The merger led to a short-term rise in NPAs and reduced the return on equity (ROE) to 12.6% in FY25 from 14.2% in FY24,"" he said.The IPO landscape has become considerably congested. The simultaneous occurrence of major issues alongside competition from LG Electronics has stretched investor funds. This situation has constrained speculative activities in the grey market, which operates based on short-term trading sentiment.According to Prashanth Tapse, Senior Vice President at Mehta Equities, investors must now be more discriminating. ""In the current IPO frenzy, where investor capital is limited, careful selection becomes crucial to maximize return. While Tata Capital's IPO has attracted attention, other high-growth offerings like LG Electronics may be drawing part of the focus,"" he said.Analysts widely agree that Tata Capital offers steady growth potential over the long run. The company plans to utilise fresh capital from its public offering to strengthen its Tier-I position, enabling expansion of its lending operations. The organisation's balanced lending portfolio, spread across consumer, small business and corporate sectors, stands to gain from India's robust credit requirements in the coming years.Whilst current unofficial market sentiment appears subdued, Tata Capital's core business metrics and established brand value position it as a stable investment avenue for extended periods rather than immediate listing gains, the ET report said.","Tata Capital stands amongst India's prominent non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) The IPO offers shares at Rs 310 to Rs 326, comprising a fresh issue of Rs 6,846 crore alongside an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 8,666 crore.

MUMBAI: Jaguar Land Rover, which faced a cyberattack in August that disrupted its production globally, is on course for a recovery. The company announced a phased resumption of operations starting Wednesday.The rebound comes after the UK government extended a 1.5-billion-pound loan guarantee to help the Tata Group-owned British luxury carmaker support its supply chain. The attack forced production halts and cost JLR about 7 million pounds a day.The financial support was approved earlier this month by UK business and trade secretary Peter Kyle, who is in Mumbai on a two-day visit with PM Keir Starmer and a 125-member delegation of CEOs, entrepreneurs, university heads, and cultural leaders. Kyle told TOI that the UK govt's backing has allowed JLR to focus on recovery, which he said has been ""quite swift"".Kyle added that the carmaker will resume production of the Range Rover Sport model this week. ""We're now going to see a steady stream of systems and therefore production coming back online,"" said Kyle, who took over as business and trade secretary a little over a month ago. He is also expected to meet Tata Group leadership during his Mumbai visit. Tata is the largest Indian investor and employer in the UK.On the cyber incident, Kyle said, ""It's too early to make conclusions about the full nature of the attack and its origins.

MUMBAI: New vectors of risk are emerging in India's securities market as capital market participants increasingly rely on third-party service providers and cloud-based platforms, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, chairman of Sebi, said at the Global Fintech Fest 2025 on Wednesday.""Sometimes these risks extend beyond traditional regulatory parameters,"" he warned, highlighting the vulnerabilities that come with rapid technological adoption. ""Every leap in technology brings its own set of risks. Cybersecurity threats have the potential to create systemic disruptions. A single data breach or operational glitch can have cascading effects across interconnected systems.""Pandey outlined the measures Sebi has taken to mitigate these threats. ""Under the Comprehensive Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework for Sebi-regulated entities, issued in Aug 2024, we have prescribed measures to ensure that regulated entities remain equipped with adequate cyber resiliency to withstand, respond to, and recover from cyber threats effectively,"" he said. Stressing that resilience is an ongoing process, he added, ""Resilience is not a one-time achievement.It's a continuous process of learning, adapting, and anticipating.""While acknowledging risks, Pandey highlighted the transformative potential of technology. ""Technology has become the regulator's most potent ally, enabling faster access to funds and reducing counterparty risk,"" he said. He cited innovations such as a two-way portability module across clearing corporations and the extension of ASBA to secondary markets through a UPI-blocked framework, which ensure smoother and safer transactions.","New vectors of risk are emerging in India's securities market.

MUMBAI: RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra on Wednesday announced the creation of a Unified Market Interface, a new market infrastructure conceptualised by the central bank that will enable instant buying, selling, and trading of financial assets as digital tokens settled through the central bank’s digital currency.“Early efforts and results from the inaugural pilot in improving market efficiency here are encouraging,” Malhotra said in his speech at the Global Fintech Fest 2025. The governor said India’s digital finance ecosystem had reached a critical juncture, with the next phase of inclusion to be driven by data integration, digital currency, asset tokenisation, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity.Malhotra said the first area of focus was unlocking the potential of financial data through the account aggregator framework, which now serves 160 million accounts and processes around 3.6 billion requests. The RBI, he said, is working on new standards for customer onboarding, consent management, and data security, and aims to promote greater interoperability among aggregators.He also pointed to the Unified Lending Interface as a means to bridge India’s credit gap by linking lenders to verified data sources. Since its launch, 3.2 million loans worth Rs 1.7 trillion have been sanctioned. The system, he said, would help lenders use data more effectively to serve individuals with thin or no credit history.Malhotra described the digital rupee as a critical new layer in India’s digital public infrastructure. The retail e-rupee, launched in Dec 2022, now includes 19 banks and 7 million users. “Interoperability with UPI is enabling wider adoption without compromising on user convenience,” he said. He added that programmable features were being used for targeted transfers and subsidies, citing Gujarat’s G-Safal scheme, which restricts spending to approved farm inputs, and a scheme in Andhra Pradesh for LPG subsidies.Malhotra said India’s fintech sector, now comprising over 10,000 firms and $40 billion in investment over the past decade, had benefited from a large technology talent base, a diverse financial ecosystem, and enabling policies of the government and regulators. “We will continue this facilitation so that fintechs can make use of the digital public infrastructure and financial ecosystem for the collective benefit of the economy,” he said.","RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra announced the creation of a Unified Market Interface.

"'Uncertainty is the new normal': IMF chief warns of economic turbulence, urges nations to ‘buckle up’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uncertainty-is-the-new-normal-imf-chief-warns-of-economic-turbulence-urges-nations-to-buckle-up/articleshow/124390420.cms,"IMF, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva (Photo-AP)





The global economy is proving more resilient than expected despite major shocks such as President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, but International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has warned that this strength may not last.“Buckle up,” Georgieva said during a speech at the Milken Institute on Wednesday, AP reported. “Uncertainty is the new normal and it is here to stay.”Her remarks came as gold prices hit a record $4,000 an ounce, reflecting investor anxiety over a weaker dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, and the policy outlook ahead of next week’s IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington. Trump’s trade penalties are expected to dominate discussions among global finance ministers and central bankers.The IMF currently forecasts global growth at 3% for the year. Georgieva credited strong policy responses, private sector adaptability, and less severe tariff impacts than initially feared for keeping growth steady.“But before anyone heaves a big sigh of relief, please hear this: Global resilience has not yet been fully tested. And there are worrying signs the test may come. Just look at the surging global demand for gold,” she cautioned.Discussing Trump’s tariffs, Georgieva warned that “the full effect is still to unfold.” She said US margin compression could “give way to more price pass-through, raising inflation with implications for monetary policy and growth.”The Republican administration has imposed import taxes on nearly all major US trading partners — including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, China, and even smaller economies such as Lesotho. “We’re the king of being screwed by tariffs,” Trump remarked Tuesday during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.While the US has announced new trade frameworks with nations such as the United Kingdom and Vietnam, the tariffs have triggered global uncertainty. “Elsewhere, a flood of goods previously destined for the US market could trigger a second round of tariff hikes,” Georgieva said.Adding to the policy uncertainty, the Supreme Court is scheduled next month to hear arguments on whether Trump has the authority to impose certain tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.Georgieva’s address also touched on social and demographic challenges, warning of deepening youth frustration worldwide. “The young are taking their disappointment to the streets from Lima to Rabat, from Paris to Nairobi, from Kathmandu to Jakarta — all are demanding better opportunities,” she said. “And here in the US, the chances of growing up to earn more than your parents keeps falling — and here too, discontent has been evident. ”She called for structural reforms to promote internal trade in Asia, business-friendly policies in Africa, and greater competitiveness in Europe. For the United States, Georgieva urged action to curb federal debt and boost household savings.According to the Treasury Department, the federal debt has surged from $380 billion in 1925 to $37.64 trillion in 2025. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in July that Trump’s new tax and spending law would add $3.4 trillion more by 2034.The IMF, a 191-member global lender, seeks to foster financial stability, sustainable growth, and poverty reduction worldwide.","IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva says global economy is proving more resilient than expected despite major shocks such as President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs.

Soybeans are new rare earths: Xi hits Trump where it hurts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/why-china-is-not-buying-us-soybeans-donald-trump-xi-jinping-us-china-trade-war-soybeans-are-new-rare-earths/articleshow/124388607.cms,"AI image for representation only.

TL:DR: Driving the news

Trump Aide Exposes American Dependency On China For Critical Minerals Crucial For Weapons | Watch

“The Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for ‘negotiating’ reasons only, not buying,” Trump posted on Truth Social.

“Soybeans will be a major topic of discussion.”

Why it matters

Soybeans are more than just beans - they’re America’s No. 1 food export, a $60 billion industry that underpins much of the rural economy.

This year, the US is sitting on a record crop with nowhere to sell it.

China buys about 61% of the world’s traded soybeans, making it irreplaceable as a buyer.

This year? China has bought zero soybeans from the current US harvest, down from $12.6 billion in purchases last year.

The shift is part of a broader trade chess match, as Beijing flexes economic muscle in response to Trump’s renewed tariffs.

“US soybeans now are not that important to China,” wrote Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings. “That’s why Beijing can afford to use the import ban as a bargaining tool.”

Moreover, Trump tariffs have raised costs for fertilizer and equipment, squeezing profit margins.

Farmers across the Midwest are storing crops, delaying sales, and watching futures markets sag. “There’s no incentive to sell right now,” Morey Hill, Iowa soybean grower, told WSJ. If a deal with China isn’t reached soon, Hill said, the soybean market “might be a bloodbath.”

US farmers face a double blow - higher expenses and fewer buyers.

Between the lines: The rare earths playbook

Global chessboard: China’s leverage

Bought up Brazil’s entire soy supply for the year.

Secured Argentine beans during a brief export tax holiday.

Blocked US beans just in time to pressure Trump.

Beijing knows American farmers are Trump’s base - and sees them as leverage. That pressure is already working.

“It’s unfortunate the Chinese leadership has decided to use American soybean farmers as a pawn in the trade negotiations,” said treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who himself owns farmland in North Dakota.

Gabriel Wildau of Teneo called soybeans “the lowest-hanging fruit” for a trade win - but warned: if the US and China can’t agree on soy, good luck negotiating TikTok, Taiwan, or semiconductors.

Bailouts and band-aids

Trump has promised help. Again.

“I’m going to do some farm stuff this week,” he said at the White House, teasing an aid package that-if history is any guide-could run between $10 billion and $50 billion. In 2019 and 2020, farmers received more than $45 billion in federal support, much of it in response to earlier trade wars and pandemic shocks.

But many farmers aren’t eager for more checks from Washington.

“All farmers are proud of what they do and they don’t like handouts,” Iowa’s Robb Ewoldt told AP. “We’d rather make it with our own two hands.”

Still, the math doesn’t lie. Farming equipment, fertilizer, and fuel costs have soared, while crop prices have tanked. According to projections from North Dakota State University’s Agricultural Risk Policy Center, US row crop farmers stand to lose up to $45 billion this year alone-before any government support.

With harvest season underway and the federal government paralyzed by a shutdown, aid payments are delayed. And even if they arrive, they won’t restore lost markets.

What's next





China, once the biggest buyer of American soybeans, hasn’t booked a single purchase from this year’s US harvest - sending prices tumbling and farmers into panic. The abrupt halt mirrors Beijing's previous use of rare earth exports as leverage in trade wars. Now, it's soybeans.US President Donald Trump said he’ll confront Chinese President Xi Jinping about the freeze at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea later this month.Meanwhile, US farmers, many of whom backed Trump in 2024, are warning of a ""bloodbath"" in rural America if the situation doesn't change fast.This isn't just about soy. It’s a strategic repeat of what China did with rare earth minerals earlier this year.Earlier this year, Beijing used its dominance of rare earth exports-a critical input for electric vehicles, military hardware, and semiconductors-as a pressure point in talks with the Trump administration over export controls.Trump eased off.Now, Beijing is doing the same with soybeans, just as harvest begins. “Beijing’s new bargaining chip is an import ban on US soybean,” Nomura’s Lu Ting wrote, according to a Bloomberg report.While soybeans may lack the exotic appeal of rare earths, they are a critical input for China’s massive hog and poultry industry. But as trade tensions escalate, China has been stocking up from South America. In September alone, it bought 2 million tons of soy from Argentina.“I always thought I would farm till they threw dirt on top of me,” Dean Buchholz, who’s farming his last crop this year, told the WSJ. He’s quitting not because of age, but because the economics no longer add up. “I can’t make it work to where it would be practical to keep going without me spending a boatload of money and keep putting myself into more debt.”""The frustration is overwhelming,"" said Caleb Ragland, 39, a Kentucky farmer and president of the American Soybean Association.And the timing is brutal. More than half of US soybean exports typically happen between October and December, just after harvest. China is holding off until Brazil’s crop is ready in February.Farmers are increasingly cynical. “We knew what Trump would do,” said Sarah Taber, a North Carolina crop scientist and blogger. “And a lot of farmers just voted for him anyway. If no deal is struck by December, US soy could miss the entire global buying window.China has played its cards well:In the 21st-century global economy, leverage doesn’t always come in the form of missiles or microchips. Sometimes it looks like a soybean. And in the hands of a strategic rival, even a humble crop can become a diplomatic weapon.China knows what it’s doing. It’s punishing Trump where he’s politically vulnerable, economically exposed, and slow to react. And it’s doing so at a moment when American farmers are too broke to fight, and too proud to ask for help.Whether Trump strikes a soybean deal at APEC or not, the damage is done. The United States built its food exports on predictability. Now, that predictability has been replaced by politics-and a bitter harvest no one wanted.(With inputs from agencies)","Soybeans are America's No. 1 food export, a $60 billion industry that underpins much of the rural economy.

The Trump administration is reportedly planning to unveil a financial aid package to support American farmers who are hit hard by China’s boycott of US soybean.The package could cost more than $10 billion, though discussions involving both treasury and agriculture departments are still in the early stages, according to a source cited by CBS.Top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Monday, ""We've had numerous meetings over the last week or two"" about ""what we're going to do"" to support farmers.

US President Donald Trump on Monday approved plans to build a 211-mile road through remote parts of Alaska to open up access to valuable mineral deposits, including copper, cobalt and gold.The Ambler Road project, located north of Fairbanks, had first been cleared during Trump’s earlier term in office, however, the Biden administration later halted it, citing threats to caribou and other wildlife, as well as to Alaska’s Native tribes that depend on hunting and fishing.At a ceremony in the Oval Office, Trump said the project “is something that should’ve been long operating and making billions of dollars for our country and supplying a lot of energy and minerals.” He also criticised former President Joe Biden, saying he “undid it and wasted a lot of time and a lot of money, a lot of effort. And now we’re starting again. And this time we have plenty of time to get it done.""The White House also announced a 10% equity stake in Trilogy Metals, a Canadian firm developing the Ambler site with an Australian partner, AP reported.In a separate move last week, the US government also announced buying a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas and a 5% stake in its Thacker Pass lithium project in Nevada, which is being developed with General Motors.Interior secretary Doug Burgum highlighted the strategic importance of the project, saying it will provide access to minerals “that we need to win the AI arms race against China.” Supporters, including Alaska’s congressional delegation, have emphasised the economic potential, noting the copper deposits could be worth more than $7 billion. Copper is essential in electronics, vehicles, and renewable energy technologies.But the project faces strong opposition. A coalition of 40 federally recognised tribes warns that the road could threaten traditional subsistence hunting and fishing, and damage salmon and caribou habitats.Karmen Monigold, an Inupiaq member of Protect the Kobuk, expressed deep concern. “And then I reminded myself of who we are, and who our people are and how far we’ve come,'' she said. “They tried to assimilate us, to wipe us out and yet we’re still here. We still matter.” She indicated that Alaska Native groups may once again pursue legal action to block the road, as reported by AP.The proposed two-lane gravel road would cut through 26 miles of Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve and cross 11 rivers and thousands of streams before reaching the planned mine site.Last month, the Republican-controlled House approved legislation allowing wider mining and drilling on public lands, reversing land protections put in place under Biden to limit fossil fuel extraction and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Trump and his allies argue that opening up the land will create jobs, increase revenue, and secure critical minerals for national security.The US president has often said, “drill, baby, drill,” and supported “mine, baby, mine,” Burgum said. “We’ve got to get back in the mining business.”Trump's order states that the proposed road is in the public interest, given US needs for domestic critical minerals, and says there is no economically feasible alternative route.","US President Donald Trump approved plans to build a 211-mile road through remote parts of Alaska to open up access to valuable mineral deposits.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

NEW DELHI: Consumption of petrol, diesel and jet fuel continued to gallop apace in February, prompted by early onset of summer and harvesting pushing up demand from the farm sector and increased mobility prompted by expanding economic activities.Early trade data shows petrol consumption rising 13%, diesel 12% and jet fuel almost 41% over the same month a year ago. Consumption of LPG , mostly used by households for cooking, grew maintained the usual modest growth at 2.4%.The growth in consumption was substantially higher than in the same month of 2021 when the economy began firing up after the pandemic.

Since diesel a key indicator economic activities, this indicates lingering pandemic overhang.In contrast, petrol sales show a sharp uptick at 20% versus February 2020 as people’s preference for personal vehicles during the post-pandemic unlock period continues as reflected in robust automobile sales.Similarly, jet fuel sales have gradually recovered but still remains 10% short of the February 2020 level, indicating some resistance at this level. Industry is banking on the summer travel season for full recovery.Sequentially also, the sales in February were higher by 13.5% for petrol, 9.2% for diesel and just 3.3% for jet fuel, the data shows.Early onset of summer and absence of winter rains have pushed up demand from the farm sector due to increased use of diesel pumps for irrigating late standing crops such as mustard. Harvesting in states that have early harvesting further boosted the demand.","Petrol consumption rose 13%, diesel 12% and jet fuel almost 41% over the same month a year ago.

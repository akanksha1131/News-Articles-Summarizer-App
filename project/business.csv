Trump scolds China

Global markets hit hard

US stock markets joined the global market selloff on Monday, with S&P 500 plunging 4%. S&P 500 saw its poorest performance since the COVID-induced economic crisis in March 2020. Markets are experiencing dramatic fluctuations as investors evaluate the implications of President Donald Trump 's international trade policies.The Dow Jones Industrial Average demonstrated extreme volatility, initially plummeting 1,700 points before surging 800 points higher, and subsequently declining 414 points. As of 1:33 pm, GMT-4, Dow Jones was trading at 332 point below the previous closure.The S&P 500 displayed similar erratic behaviour and fell 1.3% during the first trading hour, whilst the Nasdaq composite decreased by 0.8%. These movements mirror worldwide market declines as concerns intensify regarding the impact of Trump's trade policies on global economic stability. As of 1:38 PM GMT-4 on April 7, the Nasdaq Composite is trading at 15,634.50, up 46.71 points (0.30%) from the previous close of 15,587.79. Also, the S&P 500 is at 5,072.75, down by 1.33 points (0.026%) from the previous close of 5,074.08 at 1:40 PM.The S&P 500, a crucial component of numerous investors' 401(k) retirement portfolios, has declined by over 20% from its peak established less than two months ago. Should the S&P 500 close below this threshold, the decline would qualify as what financial experts term a ""bear market"".This classification indicates a more severe downturn than the typical 10% correction that occurs annually, representing a more significant economic concern.Stock markets around the world are bleeding due to US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs announcement, which has stoked fears of a global recession, including in the US. The downward trend drove Nasdaq into bear market territory during the previous week, with S&P 500 and Dow Jones approaching similar levels. A bear market occurs when values decrease by 20 percent from their recent highest point.Ahead of the US stock market opening, Trump asked people not to be weak. ""The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done decades ago. Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a Panican (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!"" he said on social media.European and Asian markets experienced sharp declines, whilst S&P 500 index futures declined 2.7% during premarket trading. The index had fallen 17.4% from its February peak by the close of the previous week. Market analysts typically classify a decline of 20% or more from a recent peak as a bear market, according to an AP report.Crude oil prices continued their downward trend, momentarily falling under $60 per barrel, reaching levels not seen since 2021. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures decreased by 2.4%, whilst Nasdaq futures registered a 3% decline.Trump reaffirmed his stance on reciprocal tariffs on Sunday regarding trade deficit reduction with partner nations, indicating he would not negotiate unless this issue was addressed.""Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump stated, whilst his administration remained unfazed by market volatility.Whilst aboard Air Force One, he informed journalists that international leaders were ""dying to make a deal.""Also Read | Stock market crash today: It's a bloodbath! Investors lose Rs 14 lakh crore as BSE Sensex ends 2,227 points down - top 5 reasons markets for fall Global stock markets have experienced losses worth trillions since Trump's tariff announcement last week, with further declines observed on Monday.In a shareholders' letter on Monday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that the tariffs ""will likely increase inflation.""""Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,"" he remarked according to an AFP report.Prominent investor Bill Ackman criticised the Trump administration's policies, stating that the president was ""launching a global economic war against the whole world at once"" and advised him to ""call a time out.""On Sunday, he expressed his concerns on X platform, warning that ""We are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter.""Donald Trump criticised China on Monday following a severe stock market decline after Beijing countered his worldwide tariffs initiative.European markets suffered significant losses, yet Asian markets experienced worse outcomes. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index plummeted 13.2 percent, marking its steepest decline since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, whilst Tokyo's Nikkei 225 witnessed a substantial drop of 7.8 percent.A fundamental 10-percent tariff on global imports became effective on Saturday, with additional countries facing increased duties from Wednesday, including 34 percent charges on Chinese products and 20 percent on EU goods.Also Read | Will Nifty follow Nasdaq into the bear market zone? Stock market crash a direct echo of Wall Street bloodbath As nations consider their responses, Beijing announced its reciprocal 34-percent duty on US imports, scheduled to commence on Thursday.Trump reprimanded Beijing early Monday for disregarding ""my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate"", whilst describing China as ""the biggest abuser of them all"" regarding tariffs.Taipei experienced its most severe decline in history, plummeting by 9.7 percent.The Stoxx Europe 600 index declined by five percent during early afternoon trading, resulting in the evaporation of more than 1.5 trillion euros in market value within a matter of days.The primary US oil contract fell under $60 per barrel, reaching its lowest point since April 2021, due to concerns about a worldwide economic downturn.Also Read | Is the world staring at a recession? ‘There will be blood’, warn experts on Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs impact ""The market's telling you in plain language: global demand is vanishing, and a global recession is on the cards and coming on fast,"" said Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management.The Indian equity markets witnessed a dramatic decline on Monday, marking the steepest percentage fall in a single day since March 2020, during the COVID-19 crisis.The primary indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty 50, initially plunged approximately 5% at the start of trading, before showing modest signs of recovery.Also Read | Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs send global shockwaves, but India may be among least vulnerable - explained in charts","US stock markets joined the global market selloff on Monday, with S&P 500 plunging 4%.

(AI image)

Why did the stock market rise today? Top 5 Reasons

1) Global market recovery

2) RBI Policy Outlook

3) Investment Opportunity

4) Oil Market Developments

5) US Bond Yields

Stock market today : BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, rallied strongly in trade on Tuesday a day after the terrible stock market crash. While BSE Sensex went above 74,800, Nifty50 was above 22,650 intraday. BSE Sensex ended the day at 74,227.08, up 1,089 points or 1.49%. Nifty50 closed at 22,535.85, up 374 points or 1.69%.Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services says, “The heightened uncertainty and volatility that has gripped markets worldwide will linger for some more time. There are some significant takeaways from the ongoing chaos. One, the trade war is like to be confined to US and China. Others including EU and Japan have opted for negotiations. India has already started negotiations on a BTA with US. Two, the risk of a recession in the US has increased. Three, China is likely to be the worst-hit economy. Trump’s threat of another 50% tariff on China will, if carried out, almost freeze Chinese exports to US. Four, China will try to dump its products like metals in other countries, and this will keep international metal prices depressed.""Investors may continue in wait and watch mode since it will take time for clarity to emerge. However, since India’s macros are stable and we can grow at around 6% in FY26 and the valuations are fair particularly in largecaps, long-term investors can start nibbling at high quality largecaps like the leading financials. Since Trump is unlikely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals at this stage, pharma stocks, which are attractively priced now, appear to be good buys,"" he adds.Consumer Durables index on Nifty saw a 3% increase, whilst Metal, Realty, and Financial Services indices gained more than 2%. The broader market indicators, Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100, rose by 2%. Additionally, India's volatility measure, India VIX, decreased by 10.2% to 20.47.Indian stock markets advanced alongside Asian counterparts as optimism grew regarding potential moderation in U.S. tariff policies.Japan's Nikkei recorded a substantial 5.6% increase after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer received directives to engage in discussions with Tokyo.Although U.S. President Donald Trump maintained his stance on implementing additional 50% tariffs if China remained non-compliant, Beijing dismissed these ""blackmail nature"" threats. Nevertheless, Hong Kong's Hang Seng increased by 1.7%, whilst China's blue-chip index moved up by 0.6%, providing stability to international markets.Market sentiment reflects anticipation of the RBI's monetary policy announcement on April 9. Analysts project a 25 basis points reduction in the repo rate, whilst expecting the central bank to adopt a more accommodative position, considering how global trade issues affect economic growth.The current market upswing reflects investors taking advantage of recent price reductions, as the Nifty index has declined by over 14.8% from its highest point. Similarly, mid-cap and small-cap indices have experienced corrections of approximately 19% and 22%, respectively.Oil prices descended below $65 on Monday, reaching the lowest point since August 2021, driven by worries that American tariffs could reduce demand and trigger a worldwide economic downturn.Brent crude traded at $65.07 per barrel on Tuesday, whilst American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) stood at $61.57 around 10:16 am IST.The American 10-year Treasury yield decreased to 4.14% from approximately 4.5% in mid-February, alongside the 2-year yield's reduction to 3.715% from 4.28%. Concurrently, the US Dollar Index registered 102.92, fostering optimistic sentiment in emerging markets, including India.The combination of a softer dollar and reduced American bond yields enhances the appeal of Indian equities to international investors, potentially attracting increased capital flows to the market.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, rallied strongly in trade on Tuesday a day after the terrible stock market crash. BSE Sensex ended the day at 74,227.08, up 1,089 points or 1.49%.

"RBI set for rate cut, banks’ cost of funds may not drop",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-set-for-rate-cut-banks-cost-of-funds-may-not-drop/articleshow/120108984.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI began its rate-cutting cycle in Feb with a 25 basis point reduction in the repo rate , but deposit rates have largely remained unchanged. While banks have passed on the benefit to home loan borrowers, the impact on depositors has been limited.According to RBI data, the weighted average domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) stood at an eight-year high of 6.91% in 2024-25. For Feb, the WADTDR touched a nine-year high of 7.02%. Only a few banks, including Bank of Baroda, HDFC Bank, and Yes Bank, have reduced rates by 15 to 40 basis points. However, this has not translated into a wider cut in fixed deposit rates across the sector. The absence of a broad-based reduction is evident in both the weighted average deposit rate and the marginal cost of lending rate, which influences bank lending to businesses.The central bank is expected to announce another 25 basis point cut in the repo rate at the end of its three-day monetary policy committee meeting on Wednesday. However, the transmission of this cut into banks' cost of funds may be delayed. This lag is partly due to changing depositor behaviour, with more investors shifting to stock markets and moving surplus funds from savings accounts to fixed deposits.""The present market volatility-whether it will result in a behavioural change among retail investors-is something that will have to be seen over a longer period and not immediately. But there has to be a significant narrowing of the gap between savings account and fixed deposit rates for the share of current and savings account to rise,"" said Anil Gupta, senior vice president, ICRA.""We are not expecting a steep reduction in FD rates because of the pressure on the liquidity coverage ratio for banks. We believe that the rate cut will be higher for wholesale deposits. So if we assume a 75 basis point reduction in the repo rate in the current cycle, we think that the funding costs will go down by 30-35 basis points,"" Gupta added.Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda, said, ""Transmission is the tricky issue which will depend on how individual banks are placed. With liquidity normalizing and likely to remain calm for some time, there is a higher possibility of banks lowering deposits rates now, though not in a commensurate manner. This can move the Marginal Cost of Funds-based Lending Rate (MCLR) and overall lending rates.""""Presently the External Benchmark Lending Rates (EBLR) move along the repo rate path, though the MCLR-based loans get linked with the deposit rates. Hence we can expect a higher degree of transmission this time if the RBI lowers rates further considering that liquidity is comfortable,"" said Sabnavis.Banks may be more willing to reduce rates if the RBI shifts its policy stance to accommodative from neutral. A change in stance would indicate a readiness to ease further if financial markets face volatility.","The central bank is expected to announce another 25 basis point cut in the repo rate at the end of its three-day monetary policy committee meeting on Wednesday.

"Rupee falls 103p in 2 days as yuan weakens, $ gains",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-falls-103p-in-2-days-as-yuan-weakens-gains/articleshow/120109562.cms,"MUMBAI: The rupee fell to a two-week low on Tuesday, pressured by a weaker yuan and a recovery in the dollar index. It closed at 86.27 against the US dollar, down from 85.84 on Monday. In two sessions, the rupee has declined by 103 paise.Bankers said corporate demand for the dollar rose on Tuesday even as the equity markets saw a recovery. Also, the year-end dollar supply, triggered by banks transferring forex from overseas to bolster local liquidity, had ended.""The rupee has come under pressure, partly due to a recovery in the dollar index and largely because of the sharp depreciation of the Chinese yuan by the authorities in response to US tariffs,"" said KN Dey, a forex consultant, who advises corporates on forex strategy.""While the dollar has gained more than one rupee in two days, it is unlikely to test the all-time low of 87.95. The earlier weakness in the rupee was driven by a rise in the dollar index, but it is unlikely that the index will return to those levels. However, in the event of a geopolitical crisis, all bets are off,"" said Dey.The depreciation of the yuan is seen as part of China's retaliatory measures against the imposition of tariffs by the United States. Given the competitive pressures, a decline in the yuan would force the RBI to allow the rupee to weaken.The rupee hit a session low of 86.29, the weakest since March 21. The Chinese onshore yuan fell 0.4% to 7.33 against the US dollar after China's central bank set the midpoint at its weakest since Sept 2023. The yuan trades within a 2% band around this midpoint. The yuan's weakness exerted pressure on other Asian currencies, with the Indonesian rupiah hitting a record low as traders returned from a break. Regional currency weakness weighed on the rupee. A trader at a state-run bank confirmed strong importer hedging demand, particularly near the session's close. Dealers expect that volatility in the forex market would restrain RBI from going all out with taking measures to improve liquidity in the forex market.","The rupee fell to a two-week low on Tuesday, pressured by a weaker yuan and a recovery in the dollar index.

Shaky Street: Sensex surges 1.1k points day after 2.2k-point crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/shaky-street-sensex-surges-1-1k-points-day-after-2-2k-point-crash/articleshow/120109476.cms,"MUMBAI: A smart recovery in the US markets overnight, positive global cues and short covering in Tuesday's session aided an impressive comeback for the stock market after Monday's rout. At close, the sensex was up 1,089 points or 1.5% at 74,227 points while the Nifty was up 374 points or 1.7% at 22,536 points. On Monday, the sensex had lost 2,227 points, its sixth biggest single-day fall ever.Tuesday's rise came on the back of reports that several countries have reached out to the US to negotiate trade terms and overcome impending hurdles to bilateral trade after Trump proposed steep new tariffs on April 2 on many of the US's trading partners.""Following positive global cues, led by interest of many nations to enter into bilateral agreements with the US, the domestic market witnessed a recovery,"" said Vinod Nair of Geojit Investments. ""In addition, this optimism stems from the fact that India's economy is driven mainly by local demand and comparatively lower reciprocal tariff. The ongoing trade negotiations with the US too has helped.""The day's gains added about Rs 7.3 lakh crore to investors' wealth with BSE's market capitalisation at Rs 396.6 lakh crore. The gains were also partly aided by strong Asian markets. In early trades, Nikkei in Japan was up more than 6% while Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up about 2%.Although most domestic investors rejoiced at the day's gains, some market players were unsure if the rally was a genuine turnaround or just a blip. They pointed out that on Tuesday, FPIs were net sellers of stocks at Rs 4,994 crore, while domestic investors were net buyers at Rs 3,097 crore, BSE data showed. ""Investors are advised not to read too much into this single-day recovery, as tariff-related developments are likely to keep volatility elevated,"" said Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking.

India Inc must adapt to changing trade policies: Assocham,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-inc-must-adapt-to-changing-trade-policies-assocham/articleshow/120110271.cms,"How US tariffs will impact India's exports, economy?

After depending on high duties for years, how prepared are businesses for a sharp drop in tariffs as govt pushes trade deals?

Your wishlist of reforms...

Union minister Piyush Goyal flagged concerns about Indian startups not doing cutting-edge work...

Sanjay Nayar wears many hats. He is the founder and chairman of Sorin Investments, part of the promoter group of Nykaa and president of industry body Assocham. In an interview with TOI, the former banker, who was also part of the organisers of Startup Mahakumbh, discusses the impact of Trump's tariffs and how govt and business should navigate it. Excerpts:US tariffs will undoubtedly pressure select Indian exporters, especially in sectors like textiles and engineering goods. However, India's economic fundamentals remain solid and domestic demand-led growth offers insulation. Manufacturers will respond by doubling down on supply chain diversification and leveraging FTAs with UAE and Australia to reduce over-dependence on US. ""China+1"" sentiment will continue to work in India's favour, with American buyers now considering India as a reliable alternative sourcing hub. While some near-term order reviews are likely, Indian exporters will start future-proofing through quality upgrades and digital supply chain integration. Overall, the impact is real - about 18% of our merchandise exports are to the US - but India's diversified export base and economic resilience will help cushion the blow. As US producers ramp up their own production capabilities, India must turn its attention to its true competitive edge -namely, the cost-effectiveness of its labour force.Indian businesses will need to adapt to this strategic shift. Govt's aggressive pursuit of FTAs with UK, EU, and other partners will compel Indian firms to enhance competitiveness, without relying on high tariffs. Initiatives such as PLI schemes and GST rationalisation, have already encouraged businesses to modernise operations, improve quality and invest in scale. While some legacy players may feel the pressure, next generation of Indian enterprises appears more agile, price-competitive and aligned with global standards. The shift in trade policy may cause short-term disruption, but it lays the foundation for long-term competitiveness.Executional consistency remains critical, businesses need stable policy frameworks without midstream reversals. Predictability, not surprises, underpins resilience in face of global shocks like US tariffs or FII outflows. Govt must fast-track deep structural reforms. Judicial and contract enforcement reforms need to move from drawing boards to the ground. Delays here stall investments, discourage risk-taking and limit job creation. MSMEs need scaled credit access and institutional backing to participate meaningfully in exports and value chains. The private sector must stop hiding behind comfortable returns on invested capital. There is far too little investment in people, R&D, and capability-building. Tax sops have become a shield, not a catalyst. Indian consumers have little real choice-competition remains limited, innovation subdued. This model is unsustainable.The minister's comments reflect a fair concern - many startups have prioritised scale over innovation. But let's recognise how far the ecosystem has come. India has produced category-defining companies in fintech, logistics, SaaS, and health-tech - often solving problems at population scale. Next wave must go beyond app-based models to deep tech, industrial innovation.","Sanjay Nayar is the founder and chairman of Sorin Investments, part of the promoter group of Nykaa and president of industry body Assocham.

PE-VC funding in late stage cos dips as investors turn cautious,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pe-vc-funding-in-late-stage-cos-dips-as-investors-turn-cautious/articleshow/120109627.cms,"CHENNAI: Private Equity-Venture Capital (PE-VC) investments in late stage companies plunged by 61% over the past four years as investors have turned cautious. It has recorded a sharp decline from $23.4 billion in CY2021 to around $9 billion last year (CY2024), data sourced from research firm Venture Intelligence has revealed.The trend continues in the current FY with investments down to nearly $1.2 billion during Jan-March (CY2025) against $2 billion in the corresponding three months period of last year. The data excludes those investments in the real estate sector.Arun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence said, growth stage and late stage deals suffered the most from 'Funding Winter' after peaking in CY2021. ""The recovery in growth stage and late stage funding is expected to be gradual, and led by domestic investors and longer term foreign investors including sovereign wealth firms, Family Offices and traditional PE firms,"" he told TOI. Also, the number of deals in the last stage companies by PE-VC investors is down from 197 in CY2021 to 165 in CY2024, the data said. Late Stage companies are those more than 10 years old or Series G or later rounds of institutional investments.Karan Agarwal, director of PE firm Wilson and Hughes said, the drop in late-stage investments is an indication that the market has fundamentally recalibrated. ""The year 2021 was an anomaly, driven by excess liquidity, record-low interest rates, and aggressive growth bets. Today, capital is more expensive, and investors are no longer funding hypergrowth without clear profitability. The reduction in deal value suggests a shift toward smaller, more structured rounds,"" he said.Pointing out that many late-stage companies raised capital at peak valuations in 2021, he said, investors are hesitant to double down without a clear path to profitability. ""The weak IPO pipeline means exit options are limited, leading PE-VC firms to deploy cautiously. Instead of fuelling aggressive scaling, capital is flowing into companies that can demonstrate strong cash flow and operational efficiency,"" Agarwal added.Navin Honagudi, managing partner at Elev8 Venture Partners said, the trend of selective investments is likely to persist this year. ""While we might see some recovery in certain sectors as macroeconomic conditions stabilize, the focus will remain on sustainability rather than just top-line growth. Investors are increasingly aware that the low-cost, high-growth days of the past may not return.However, this doesn't mean opportunities will dry up.

The plea seeks interim relief to prevent coercive action by Mumbai police. Kamra, 36, who resides in Tamil Nadu, says despite the dire threats issued to him, Mumbai police has refused to permit him to appear via video conferencing in response to the summons and has demanded that he be physically present.The HC, scheduling the matter for Tuesday, said the other side—MLA Murji Patel—also has to be served as he must be heard too. Patel is the complainant against Kamra. The HC suggested that Kamra ought to, in keeping with a Supreme Court ruling, consider filing for regular pre-arrest bail in Mumbai, which would have to be filed before the sessions court.Dwelling on fundamental rights, Seervai said the FIR makes no case and ought to be stayed. Kamra's petition was filed on Saturday. His case is that he expressed personal views on the political upheaval in Maharashtra and the Shiv Sena split.The complaint by the MLA alleges that Kamra defamed deputy CM Eknath Shinde and damaged the reputation of his party.Kamra's show was held in February, but once uploaded on social media last month, it was met with an immediate and violent reaction by Sena party workers, who vandalised the Mumbai venue, said Kamra's plea, adding that he received death threats too. Police also summoned Kamra's team and his audience at the show. He said they also disturbed his senior citizen parents under the guise of serving the summons at 10.30 pm.The petition says the FIR is ""mala fide"" and the proceedings ""malicious and politically motivated by members of Shinde-led Sena—a gross abuse of their power as part of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra."" It says the FIR discloses no offence under section 353 (1) (b) of BNS of causing fear or alarm to the public or for inducing anyone to disrupt public tranquillity. Kamra has interim protection against arrest from Madras HC.The petition before the Bombay HC, drafted by advocate Ashwin Thool and filed through advocate Meenaz Kakalia, questions the alacrity with which the FIR was registered in ""70 minutes"" after the complaint was filed on Kamra's stand-up routine at the Khar venue.Given that the show provides ""satirical commentary on social and political events,"" the FIR exemplifies ""gross abuse of process and mala fide deployment of the criminal justice machinery by a member of the State Legislative Assembly, resulting in patent violation of a citizen's fundamental rights, including the fundamental right to freedom of speech and freedom to practice any profession,"" the petition said.Kamra's petition says, ""The registration of the FIR and ensuing investigation has also had a profound and chilling effect on all political speech in the country, as all citizens are presented with the possibility of the weaponization of the criminal justice system in response to all commentary and criticism against political leaders and those in positions of authority.

The market showed signs of improvement near closing, with Nifty closing 726 points down at 22,178 (-3.2%).

Investors at Dalal Street experienced substantial losses with their collective wealth diminishing by Rs 14 lakh crore following a significant downturn in benchmark indices, influenced by worldwide market turbulence due to recession concerns.

Both Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap100 indices experienced substantial selling, declining by 3.5% and 3.8% respectively.

Indian markets performed comparatively better than other Asian markets due to reduced tariffs and less dependence on American exports.

Among sectors, the Metal Index fell by nearly 7% due to escalating US-China trade tensions, with China implementing export limitations on crucial rare metals.

Nifty IT index finished with a decline of over 2%, after reaching a new 52-week low of 30,919 during trading hours. The index has decreased by more than 8% in three sessions, as investors became cautious due to potential recession concerns in the US, which is India's primary market for technology services.

China’s second-highest leader Li Qiang said on Tuesday that the country has the necessary tools to handle economic challenges, following widespread tariffs imposed by the United States, China’s main trading partner.""China's macroeconomic policy this year takes full account of various uncertainties and has a sufficient reserve of policy tools,"" Premier Li Qiang told European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen during a phone call, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. ""China can fully hedge against adverse external effects, and is fully confident of maintaining sustained and healthy economic development.""The comments were made during a phone call on Tuesday, in which both sides discussed ways to bring ""stability and predictability"" to the global economy after the disruption caused by US tariffs .""The resolute measures taken by China are not only to safeguard its own sovereignty, security and development interests, but also to defend international trade rules and international fairness and justice,"" Li told von der Leyen, according to a Chinese summary of the call.This was their first call since von der Leyen began her second term in office in December. It was also the first high-level contact between the two sides since US President Donald Trump introduced global tariffs, to which China reacted strongly. The European Union is still preparing a response.The EU raised trade concerns with China, but the wording of the summary indicated that the bloc was seeking to improve relations with Beijing, which have worsened in recent years, South China Morning Post reported..As both sides face pressure from US trade actions and deal with weak economic conditions, some observers believe it makes sense to try and improve ties, although European governments remain concerned about China’s economic policies.While China has responded to US tariffs, the EU is still working on its approach. EU members will vote on Wednesday on possible measures against US tariffs on steel and aluminium. A response to the ""reciprocal tariffs"" and car duties is expected next week.At the same time, Brussels is cautious about being caught in the middle of a conflict between major powers.

US markets spiraled Tuesday after a roller-coaster session that saw early optimism quickly erased by renewed fears over President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war. Despite a powerful morning rally, stocks ended in the red as traders braced for fresh tariffs set to take effect just after midnight.The S&P 500 soared as much as 4.1% at the open—enough for what could have been one of its best performances in years—but those gains evaporated within hours. The benchmark index ultimately closed down 1.6%, now hovering nearly 19% below its February peak.The Dow Jones Industrial Average , after surging more than 1,460 points in early trading, reversed course and closed 320 points lower, a drop of 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq took a steeper hit, falling 2.1%.The volatility mirrored chaos in global markets , where major indices had rallied earlier. Tokyo’s Nikkei rose 6%, Paris saw a 2.5% gain, and Shanghai climbed 1.6%. Still, financial experts warned investors not to get comfortable. Swings, they say, may continue not just in the coming days—but within single trading sessions.Much of the instability stems from concerns over how long Trump will maintain steep tariffs on US trading partners. Higher duties could mean pricier goods for American consumers and a broader economic slowdown . While a short-term resolution could ease the damage, the threat of a prolonged trade war is rattling nerves.On Monday, Trump threatened to dramatically raise tariffs on China, prompting an aggressive response from Beijing. “Fight to the end,” Chinese officials said, vowing to implement retaliatory measures. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt followed up Tuesday, warning that the administration’s next tariff hike will take effect after midnight. “Imports from China will be taxed at a stunning 104% rate,” she said.The president has made it clear there will be no carve-outs. “We do not intend to have any exemptions or exclusions in the tariffs,” said Trump’s top trade adviser, Jamieson Greer.Despite the tension, a hint of optimism crept into markets after Trump announced promising talks with South Korea. “Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the US, and things are looking good,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “We are likewise dealing with many other countries, all of whom want to make a deal with the United States.”He also credited a phone call with South Korea’s acting president for helping move toward the “confines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries.”Meanwhile, Japan appeared to move proactively. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed his lead negotiator for trade discussions with the US, following a recent understanding between Ishiba and Trump, according to Japanese government sources.Still, analysts urged caution. “The key countries continue to escalate, rather than de-escalate,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.During Senate testimony, US trade officials acknowledged that around 50 nations have reached out regarding trade disputes. “If you have a better idea to achieve reciprocity and to get our trade deficit down, we want to talk with you, we want to negotiate with you,” said the US trade representative.As the clock ticks toward midnight, investors and governments alike are bracing for what could be the most aggressive stage yet in Trump’s high-stakes trade offensive.","The S&P 500 closed down 1.6%, nearly 19% below its February peak.

Ray Dalio warns of historic global breakdown: 'It's not just about tariffs',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ray-dalio-warns-of-historic-global-breakdown-its-not-just-about-tariffs/articleshow/120099731.cms,"Billionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio , is sounding the alarm—not about tariffs, but about something far more systemic. In a lengthy statement, Dalio urges the public and policymakers not to fixate on the headline-grabbing tariff wars, but instead to understand the underlying economic, political, and geopolitical forces that are fundamentally reshaping the world order.""Don't make the mistake of thinking that what's now happening is mostly about tariffs,"" Dalio wrote. “A huge amount of attention is being justifiably paid to the announced tariffs and their very big impacts… while very little attention is being paid to the circumstances that caused them and the biggest disruptions that are likely still ahead.”Dalio, whose macroeconomic insights have guided Bridgewater to become one of the world’s most successful hedge funds, paints a grim but historically grounded picture. According to him, the US and global economies are in the early stages of what he calls an “Overall Big Cycle” breakdown—an unraveling of the monetary system , political structures, and international relationships that have held since the mid-20th century.He points to five converging disruptions:1. The monetary/economic order is straining under unsustainable debt levels and imbalances between debtor nations like the US and creditor nations like China.2. Domestic political order is weakening under growing inequality, polarization, and institutional gridlock.3. The international geopolitical order is shifting from US-led multilateralism to a fractured, power-based system.4. Acts of nature like climate events and pandemics are becoming more economically disruptive.5. Technological change, particularly AI, is set to reshape economies, labor markets, and power dynamics between nations.Dalio warns that many of the policies and shifts we’re witnessing—like the Trump administration’s aggressive trade stance—are not isolated events but outcomes of much deeper structural problems. “This sort of breakdown occurs only about once in a lifetime,” he said. ""They have happened many times in history when similar unsustainable conditions were in place.”Referencing his books, Dalio argues that these patterns are not new. He draws comparisons to historical cycles that led to depressions, civil unrest, and even global wars—events that, in his view, cleared the way for new world orders to emerge.He also warns that current US debt accumulation is untenable and that the geopolitical relationship between the US and China could push both nations toward more extreme policy moves, including capital controls and trade restrictions. “We are in the early part of the process of [the monetary order] changing,” he notes.Dalio’s message is clear: Understanding the big picture is more urgent than ever. “If you allow yourself to be distracted [by things like tariffs], you will… miss how the conditions and the dynamics of these big forces are causing these news-making changes.”The statement closes with a plea for smarter, historically aware policymaking and a more thoughtful public discourse. “I hoped… to help policy makers understand these forces… to help individuals… and to encourage smart people who have different views than mine to have open, thoughtful exchanges.”While his views do not necessarily reflect those of Bridgewater Associates, Dalio's track record and global outlook ensure that when he speaks, both Wall Street and Washington listen.","Billionaire investor and founder of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, is sounding the alarm about something far more systemic.

Tariff war: Inside Elon Musk’s personal appeal to Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tariff-war-inside-elon-musks-personal-appeal-to-donald-trump-and-why-it-failed/articleshow/120098608.cms,"Why it matters

The big picture: Musk had reasons to act

The world’s 500 wealthiest individuals saw a combined $536 billion wiped out in just two days of stock market trading following Trump’s “liberation day” tariff announcement last Wednesday — the largest two-day drop ever recorded by Bloomberg’s billionaires index.

Elon Musk alone has lost an estimated $130 billion in net worth so far this year. Still, he holds onto the top spot as the world’s richest person with a fortune of $302 billion, a Bloomberg report said.

Tesla stock has fallen over 38% this year. Analysts say Trump’s tariffs, coupled with growing backlash to Musk’s political entanglements, are driving down Tesla demand in key markets like China and Europe. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities — long a Tesla bull — downgraded the company’s target price to $315 from $550, citing a “brand crisis tornado that has now turned into an F5 tornado.”

“Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally,” Ives wrote, warning that Musk’s identity is now inseparable from the headwinds facing his company, the WaPo report said.

During a virtual appearance at a far-right Italian political conference, Musk called for a “free trade zone” between the US and Europe, adding, “both Europe and the United States should move ideally... to a zero-tariff situation.”

Musk also suggested liberalized immigration between the US and Europe, stating, “That has certainly been my advice to the president.”

What they’re saying

Musk has not minced words—online or off. In a series of X posts, he attacked Peter Navarro, Trump’s top trade adviser, ridiculing his academic background: “A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing.” In a now-deleted post, he went further, saying Navarro “ain’t built s—.”

Navarro declined to comment directly on Musk’s criticisms, but later told CNBC that Musk’s views were seen within the administration as “those of a car assembler,” not a trade strategist. “He is a car person,” Navarro said. “That’s what he loves.”

Kimbal Musk, Elon’s brother and fellow Tesla board member, added fuel to the fire, writing on X: “Who would have thought that Trump was actually the most high tax American President in generations? Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer.”

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, sounded the alarm: “Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally … and that is a very bad thing for the future of this disruptive tech stalwart and the brand crisis tornado that has now turned into an F5 tornado.” Ives slashed Tesla’s price target from $550 to $315.

Zoom in: Wall Street has joined the revolt

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon wrote that Trump’s tariffs “will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession .”

.” Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman called them an “economic nuclear winter.”

Billionaires Stan Druckenmiller, Ken Fisher, and Larry Fink all voiced concerns about the trade war ’s impact on investment and global market stability.

’s impact on investment and global market stability. On Capitol Hill, some GOP senators are feeling the heat. Senator Ted Cruz, a vocal Trump supporter, labeled the tariffs a “massive tax increase” on American consumers and warned of “enormous risks.” Cruz called Musk “one of the angels” trying to steer Trump toward a more balanced trade strategy.

Between the lines

What’s next?

The bottom line

Musk made a personal, political, and ideological bet that he could steer Trump off the tariff cliff. He lost—at least for now. The failed effort underscores the limits of even the most powerful insiders when clashing with Trump’s instincts. And with the global economy hanging in the balance, the costs of that loss could be just beginning.

If Musk can't stop Trump...

Elon Musk is used to being heard. He leads some of the world’s most high-profile companies and owns one of the most influential social media platforms: X. Musk, the world’s richest person, is one of US President Donald Trump ’s most visible allies. This past weekend, Musk made personal pleas to Trump to halt a sweeping new round of tariffs. But Trump didn’t budge.According to the Washington Post, Musk’s behind-the-scenes intervention, confirmed by two sources familiar with the exchange, failed to stop the administration’s latest salvo: A 10% baseline tariff on all US imports, with steeper duties on countries like China.Interestingly, Trump not only ignored Musk’s advice — he escalated. On Monday, the president threatened to slap an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports, compounding the baseline 10% tax already imposed on all US imports and triggering market turbulence across the globe.Musk’s campaign wasn’t limited to direct outreach. People in his orbit, including investor Joe Lonsdale, made their own appeals to administration insiders like Vice President JD Vance and treasury secretary Scott Bessent. Lonsdale publicly warned that tariffs would hurt US businesses more than foreign competitors.Musk’s failed intervention marks a dramatic and very public fracture within Trump’s inner circle. Musk has poured nearly $290 million into supporting Trump-aligned causes and candidates. His inability to influence Trump’s trade play reveals how the president’s protectionist instincts may now eclipse even his most high-profile allies, the Washington Post report said.It also underscores growing divisions between the business world and Trump’s “America First” trade agenda. While Musk has long opposed tariffs, his recent public campaign—including a pointed video of free-market icon Milton Friedman posted to X—signals a broader rebellion among pro-Trump elites now confronting real economic fallout.Musk’s opposition to tariffs is not new. Tesla filed a lawsuit during Trump’s first term to challenge tariffs on Chinese imports. At the time, Musk vacillated between backing the lawsuit and distancing himself after right-wing criticism accused him of aligning with China.Still, his public pivot this time feels different. Musk appears willing to risk his status inside the Trump camp to oppose what he views as bad economic policy. His appeals to Friedman’s free-trade ideology and repeated calls for zero tariffs suggest a deeper philosophical divide with Trump’s economic nationalism.Some insiders say Musk believed Trump might be open to negotiation, particularly if economic data worsens or the stock market slides further. That may explain Musk’s later attempt at a more conciliatory tone, endorsing an X thread from the US Trade Representative about unfair global trade practices. “Good points,” Musk wrote.Musk’s days inside the administration may be numbered. He is expected to depart his DOGE post in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, other business leaders are quietly organizing a coalition to lobby Trump officials for more moderate trade policies. Treasury secretary Bessent hinted over the weekend that some tariffs could be part of a broader negotiating tactic.Still, Trump shows no sign of retreat. He’s threatened to veto bipartisan legislation that would limit his unilateral tariff powers. The White House remains publicly united: “When [Trump] makes a decision, everyone rows in the same direction to execute,” said press secretary Karoline Leavitt.What makes Musk’s failure so striking isn’t just the scale of his wealth or influence. It’s that if a megadonor, top adviser, and media empire owner can’t change Trump’s mind, it’s unclear who can.For now, the billionaire revolt is real but disjointed. Some are posting. Some are calling senators. Some are just hoping it all passes.But with Musk’s own fortune on the line — and with Tesla’s brand increasingly politicized — the fallout from this failed intervention may just be getting started.(With inputs from agencies)","The world’s 500 wealthiest individuals saw a combined $536 billion wiped out in just two days of stock market trading last Wednesday.

Will Trump’s tariffs trigger a recession in US?

Global supply chains

are getting jammed

Consumer habits are already changing

Businesses are hesitating

So, is US in a recession?

What will pledge the beginnings of one?

Can the Fed interject? Possibly — but it's complicated

Trump's take? This is the cure

President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs — including a 10% duty on nearly all countries and added taxes on imports from 60 nations — have triggered a financial tremor. The stock market plunged last week, and now economists are asking a bigger question: Could these tariffs tip the US economy into a recession?The short answer? Not yet. But the country is getting closer.Goldman Sachs economists just increased the probability of a recession to 45%, from 35% last week. JPMorgan is even more pessimistic, estimating at 60% and cautioning inflation can rise to 4.4% by the end of the year — from the current 2.8%.""We expect to revise our forecast to a recession"" if tariffs remain, wrote Goldman's Jan Hatzius and colleagues.So what are the indicators that a recession is in the making? And how will we know if US is already there?The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tool — an online, real-time gauge of economic growth — now estimates a 0.8% decline in first-quarter 2025. That's a sharp decline from the 2.4% growth registered in late 2024. It's not an official forecast but one of the most closely followed early indicators.Wells Fargo estimates that U.S. tariffs would rise to an average of 23% — a record since 1908. That sort of change ""will throw sand in the gears of global supply chains in ways we haven't seen since the pandemic — and perhaps since World War II,"" Wells Fargo economist Shannon Grein said.Apollo's chief economist, Torsten Slok, is monitoring unusual economic metrics: increased bankruptcies, declining Vegas trips, and subpar movie attendance. Air travel bookings from Canada to the U.S. are expected to drop 70% in the next six months.Even if tariffs are reversed, Slok cautions that uncertainty alone may lead people to spend less — a recessionary ripple effect.Tariffs can be intended to increase U.S. manufacturing, but businesses don't know how long they will last. That uncertainty might slow factory investments, hiring, and expansion plans.Job cuts and government austerity may add pressureThe Trump administration is cutting jobs across federal agencies and reducing spending — actions that could further burden the economy, at least in the short term.Not officially. Recessions are announced by the National Bureau of Economic Research — a behind-the-scenes group of economists who characterize it as ""a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.""They monitor hiring, spending, factory production, and income. But they usually make the announcement months — even a year — after a recession has started.Look for a steady acceleration of layoffs and a surge in jobless claims. Jobless claims have yet to climb to worrying levels. But if it happens, then watch out because it may become a critical moment of turning around.Most economists now anticipate that the Fed will reduce interest rates beginning in June. But since inflation is already high — and tariffs are bound to make it higher — the Fed might need to wait unless there is an unmistakable economic downturn.""They can't actually be proactive here because they do have inflation concerns,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg of TD Securities.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cautioned Friday that tariffs would make inflation worse and indicated the central bank will remain on the sidelines — at least for now.""Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" the former president said Sunday. His administration thinks the short-term hurt will be worth it in long-term prosperity.Whether the economy concurs — or plunges into a outright recession — will be clearer over the coming months.","The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tool now estimates a 0.8% decline in first-quarter 2025.

It was a $2.5 trillion rally that lasted just 7 minutes - amidst all the global gloom and doom - the US stock markets rallied briefly on Monday.

EU response to Trump's tariffs: A delicate balance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-response-to-trumps-tariffs-a-delicate-balance/articleshow/120090092.cms,"What happened?

Avoiding any hasty reactions

Striking the right balance

Finding unity

Not the first trade war

Possible countermeasures

Tariffs on services

As US tariffs on EU exports escalate, Europe scrambles for a unified response. Trade ministers met in Luxembourg to chart the way forward — and the stakes are high.It might have been good intuition or simply the inevitable outcome of escalating rhetoric from across the Atlantic, but the European Union 's trade ministers chose to move up their extraordinary Council meeting. Instead of waiting until May, they convened this Monday in Luxembourg, marking their first political gathering since US President Donald Trump 's latest tariffs salvo.One message was clear from the start: Europe will respond with both unity and determination. French minister delegate for trade Laurent Saint-Martin criticized the US tariffs as ""very aggressive and arbitrary,"" adding that France ""prefers cooperation to confrontation.""Meanwhile, Germany's outgoing Economic Minister Robert Habeck underscored the need for European solidarity, emphasizing that only through cooperation would the EU stand a chance of overcoming the growing trade tensions.The stakes of these discussions were high — and the objectives even higher. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic framed the moment as a critical juncture in global trade, asserting that Europe must now recalibrate its position to navigate what he called a paradigm shift in international commerce.Last week, the EU faced a major blow as the US unveiled its third round of tariffs — set to be the largest yet. Nearly all goods exported from the EU to the US will be subject to a 20% levy, announced by President Donald Trump. This move follows the imposition of 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, as well as a similar 25% tariff on car exports that have already come into effect.The potential fallout is significant. These new tariffs will impact around 70% of all EU exports to the US, valued at €532 billion ($585 billion) in 2024. Trump has defended the measures, pointing to Europe's substantial trade surplus with the US, which reached $235.6 billion (€215.5 billion) in 2024, according to US government figures.Those hoping for concrete announcements on how the EU will respond to the sweeping tariffs after Monday's meeting were left disappointed.Without offering specifics, Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic made it clear that the Council’s primary focus had been on finalizing countermeasures to address Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs. However, he acknowledged that the latest round of tariffs ""forces us to consider additional steps.""The insights gathered from member states through their ministers will now be evaluated before any further decisions are made.Since Trump's bold announcement in the White House Rose Garden last Wednesday, the EU has been grappling with how to respond effectively.""They must strike a balance between the necessary political response — demanding that the US stop its actions and adopting countermeasures — and the economic reality that implementing tariffs could ultimately be counterproductive for the European economy,"" says Cinzia Alcidi, Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels.A key challenge in crafting a unified response is that the American tariffs do not affect all EU member states equally. Germany, the hardest hit in terms of export volume, sent goods worth over €161 million ($176 million) to the US in 2024 — accounting for 23% of its total exports. Ireland, too, has much to lose, as nearly 30% of its exports are destined for the US. In contrast, countries like the Netherlands and Poland have a trade deficit with the US and are less affected.This has led to European economy ministers pleading for different responses, from tough to cooperative. Ireland's Trade Minister Simon Harris emphasized Europe's desire for dialogue, stating, ""This is a trading relationship that matters, and Europe has been very clear: we are up for a deal."" European counter tariffs that could in turn lead to further escalation could be harmful for the big pharmaceutical exporter.Niclas Poitiers, Research Fellow at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels, is confident that Europe will rise to the challenge. ""Although not on the same scale, we've fought a number of trade wars, and the EU knows how to navigate these situations,"" he says. Poitiers points to Brexit as a prime example, where EU member states learned that standing united put them in a stronger position than fighting individually.Monday's meeting was therefore all about strategy, says one EU diplomat. When to hit back, what sectors to target and how, rather than losing time with each capital declaring what industries they want to protect.So, what might these countermeasures look like? One potential package is already on the table and set for a vote this Wednesday by EU member states. This package serves as the EU's official response to the first round of US tariffs on aluminum and steel back in March, and it includes duties on high-profile products. The proposed tariffs could impact up to $28 billion (€25.7 billion) worth of American imports — ranging from chewing gum and toilet paper to diamonds and dental floss, according to a recent Reuters report.If approved, the first set of countermeasures would take effect on April 15th, and the second round of measures on May 16th, in accordance with the WTO’s requirement for a 30-day gap between actions.Economist Alcidi explains that this initial package is designed to limit the impact on European consumers, aiming to limit sharp price hikes, while still sending a clear message that the EU is prepared to retaliate firmly.Additional measures could take things even further. Some are advocating for the use of the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), a newly introduced and highly potent tool in the EU's arsenal. The ACI came into effect in December 2023 but has yet to be used. This instrument allows the EU to go beyond traditional countertariffs on goods and extend its reach to services, among other areas.US digital services, such as Microsoft and Netflix, have substantial consumer bases in Europe, meaning that trade restrictions could significantly impact American companies. In fact, when considering services alone, the US faced a trade surplus of €109 billion ($118.9 billion) with the EU in 2023 — a detail often overlooked by the US administration when discussing ""unfair"" trade imbalances.","US tariffs on EU exports escalate, Europe scrambles for a unified response.

Tech billionaire and DOGE head Elon Musk made direct appeals to US President Donald Trump to reverse sweeping tariffs over the past weekend.According to a report in Washington Post, which cited sources, Musk's efforts were unsuccessful.Both the White House and Musk are yet to respond to the report of Tesla CEO's request to Trump.The global market on Monday witnessed a meltdown after Trump doubled down on his tariffs and China retaliated with 34 per cent duties on all American products. However, Asian stock markets and US futures staged a sharp recovery on Tuesday, led by a stunning 6 per cent surge in Japan's Nikkei 225, as global markets began to stabilise after a turbulent session triggered Trump's tariff threats.Early Tuesday, China's commerce ministry vowed to ""fight to the end,"" promising countermeasures against the proposed tariffs, though without detailing specific steps.Indian stock indices also opened higher on Tuesday after a bloodbath on Monday. BSE Sensex was at 74,331.00, up 1,193.10 points or 1.63 per cent while the Nifty 50 at National Stock Exchange (NSE) was up 385.50 points or 1.74 per cent at 22,547.10.Following sharp declines in market, Trump on Monday called for Americans to ""be strong, courageous, and patient.""""The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,"" Trump said.""Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid!... Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!""Recently, Musk called for an end to trade barriers between the US and Europe, while speaking virtually at a congress hosted by Italy's right-wing League Party in Florence, advocating for a zero-tariff policy. The billionaire expressed skepticism about Trump's tariffs during a video conference with Italian politicians. He emphasised that US tariffs would drive up costs for Tesla, his electric automaker.""I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally in my view to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,"" Musk said in a video conference .Musk, who has been involved in Trump's advisory circles and currently leads a government-initiated task force focused on cutting public sector waste, is reportedly facing mounting pressure as Tesla reels from the fallout. The electric carmaker's sales have taken a hit in recent quarters, with investors concerned about the broader implications of the new tariffs. Tesla shares closed at $233.29 on Monday, down more than 42 per cent since the start of the year.Several cases of vandalism against Tesla vehicles came to light in recent days, with Musk condemning the acts. Several opponents of Trump and Musk rallied across the US to protest the administration’s actions on government downsizing, the economy, human rights and other issues.Musk has previously acknowledged the heavy toll of the auto tariffs, calling their impact on Tesla ""significant.""Economists warn the tariffs could trigger inflationary pressure, increase the likelihood of a recession, and push up the cost of living for American families—potentially undermining a central pillar of Trump’s re-election campaign.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk made direct appeals to US President Donald Trump to reverse sweeping tariffs over the past weekend.

Following China's reaction, Asian markets opened higher after a volatile session a day earlier.Benchmark indices on Tuesday showed signs of recovery as Nifty and Sensex surged in pre-opening session. The Indian market opened in green; Sensex currently at 74,293.29, up by 1155.39 points, while, Nifty surged 415.95 points to 22,577.55.Earlier on Monday, India's stock markets mirrored the global panic. The Sensex plunged over 5 per cent, dropping nearly 3,000 points in early trade, while the Nifty slid over 1,100 points. All 30 stocks on the Sensex traded in the red, with major players like Tata Steel, Infosys, and ICICI Bank taking heavy hits.The Nikkei rose 6.5 per cent to 33,148.52 by late morning in Tokyo, buoyed by investor bargain-hunting after Wall Street's turbulent session on Monday.Australian stocks edged higher on Tuesday, recovering from the previous day's sharp sell-off, as reassurances from treasurer Jim Chalmers helped calm investor nerves amid global trade tensions.The S&P/ASX 200 index rose 1.1 per cent to 7,423.40 by 0035 GMT, following a steep 4.2 per cent drop on Monday — a fall that pushed the benchmark to levels last seen at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.Tuesday's gains were driven largely by strength in banking and mining stocks, sectors seen as resilient in the face of external shocks. Investor sentiment improved after Chalmers expressed confidence in Australia's ability to weather the economic fallout from US President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff measures.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index opened 1.66 per cent higher after Monday's historic 13.2 per cent drop — its worst since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. However, gains remained modest compared to earlier losses. In contrast, mainland China's Shanghai Composite dipped slightly by 0.07 per cent.Indonesia's markets, closed for several days due to public holidays, faced a steep sell-off as trading resumed. The Jakarta Composite Index plunged over 9 oer cent, triggering a temporary suspension in trading amid concerns over steep US tariffs.Similar fears sent Taiwan's Taiex index down 3 per cent, with major tech firms like Foxconn and TSMC seeing notable losses.Thai stocks tumbled more than 4 per cent at the opening bell on Tuesday, following a national holiday that had shielded the country from a global market rout sparked by renewed US trade tensions.The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index fell nearly 50 points from Friday's close of 1,125.21 — a sharp drop from recent highs of around 1,400 seen before Donald Trump took office as US President in January.Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke with US secretary of state Marco Rubio, emphasising the importance of concluding a bilateral trade agreement between India and the US.""Good to speak with Rubio today. Exchanged perspectives on the Indo-Pacific, the Indian Sub-continent, Europe, Middle East/West Asia and the Caribbean. Agreed on the importance of the early conclusion of the Bilateral Trade Agreement. Look forward to remaining in touch,"" he wrote on X.Oil prices also reflected global uncertainties, with US crude briefly dipping below $60 for the first time since 2021. Gold climbed to $3,011.60 per ounce as investors sought safe havens, while Bitcoin rebounded slightly to $80,081 after falling below $79,000.As global markets continue to gyrate, investors remain on edge, watching closely for any signals of easing tensions between the world's two largest economies.The market turmoil follows US President Donald Trump's fresh threat of imposing a 50 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, compounding fears of a prolonged trade battle. Trump insisted that China should not retaliate, warning that overall tariffs could rise to 104 per cent if Beijing doesn't back down.""I have great respect for China, but they cannot do this,"" Trump said from the White House, making it clear he had no plans to ease up on his tariff campaign.In response, China's commerce ministry declared it would ""fight to the end"" to defend its economic interests. It also announced 34 per cent duties on US imports, scheduled to come into effect on Thursday.Despite the tensions, Beijing reiterated its openness to dialogue, saying that ""there are no winners in a trade war.""US markets plunged sharply on Monday, mirroring a global selloff. The S&P 500 dropped 3.8 per cent in early trading, extending last week's heavy losses — its worst performance since the Covid-19 pandemic sent markets into freefall in March 2020.The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by more than 1,200 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite slid 4 per cent, reflecting broad-based concerns across sectors.Further, Wall Street stocks closed mostly lower after a choppy trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.9 per cent to end at 37,965.60. The S&P 500 also lost ground, dipping 0.2 per cent to close at 5,062.25.In contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite eked out a modest gain, rising 0.1 per cent to finish at 15,603.26, supported by strength in select technology stocks.","Asian markets bounced back on Tuesday following a brutal global sell-off on Monday.

Tesla Shares Today: Tesla stock price drops to what Trump aide said would 'never happen' amid 'Black Monday' mayhem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-stock-price-drops-to-what-trump-aide-said-never-happen-amid-black-monday-mayhem/articleshow/120073603.cms,"Tesla shares dropped to a record low on Monday.

What does Elon Musk think of Trump tariff?



As Tesla's stock reached a new low Monday, investors revisited what Donald Trump 's commerce secretary Howard Lutnick commented about Tesla stock a month ago. Last month, Tesla stock plummeted owing to the global protest against Elon Musk because of his influence in the Trump administration. Thousands of Tesla vehicles were set on fire in a global Tesla Takedown program. At that time, Lutnock said Tesla shares would not go down below this point and hence everyone should buy Tesla shares. But on Monday Tesla shares dropped to $214.80 down from $235.86 when Lutnick made his remarks.“I think if you want to learn something on this show tonight, it’s buy Tesla,” Lutnick told on Fox in March, urging viewers to put their money in the company of a Trump administration employee.“It’s unbelievable that this guy’s stock is this cheap,"" Lutnick said and added that Muyis the best person to bet on.The value of Tesla opened at $223 per share on Monday. It vascillated throughout the morning, rising to about $244 per share by 10:15 a.m. By 11:30 a.m., it had dropped back down to $225 per share and remained around $227 per share by noon. By 1 p.m. ET, it had leveled out at about $228 per share.Elon Musk has distanced from Trump's tariff and publicly countered Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro, calling for zero-tariff deal with Europe. “A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing,” Musk wrote about Navarro reacting to a post on X.Musk then pitched for a zero-tariff situation between the US and Europe, though Trump has imposed a 20 per cent tariff on the European Union. “I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America,” Musk said.Navarro reacted to Musk's comments and said Musk is speaking as a car-seller as his business interest has been hurt. “The thing that I think is important about Elon to understand is he sells cars. That’s what he does,” Navarro said.","The value of Tesla opened at $223 per share on Monday.

For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of carbon use per year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

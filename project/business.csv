LPG Price Hike: Commercial cylinder becomes Rs 111 costlier — check new prices for major cities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lpg-price-hike-commercial-cylinder-becomes-rs-111-costlier-check-new-prices-for-major-cities/articleshow/126284216.cms,"File photo (ANI image)

Oil marketing companies have raised the prices of commercial LPG cylinders from today, reversing recent reductions. The increase is set to push up operating costs for hotels, restaurants and other service providers across the country.The price of a 19-kg commercial LPG cylinder has been hiked by Rs 111 nationwide. In Delhi, the retail price now stands at Rs 1,691.50, up from Rs 1,580.50.Mumbai saw prices rise from Rs 1,531.50 to Rs 1,642.50, while Kolkata’s rate increased from Rs 1,684 to Rs 1,795. Chennai recorded a sharp rise in prices, climbing from Rs 1,739.50 to Rs 1,849.50. Prices of 5-kg free trade LPG (FTL) cylinders were also raised by Rs 27.The increase is expected to significantly impact operating expenses for businesses that rely heavily on cooking gas, particularly in the hospitality and catering sectors, which had seen some relief last month due to successive reductions.Household consumers, however, have been spared from the latest revision. Domestic LPG cylinder prices (14.2 kg) remain unchanged, continuing at Rs 853, where they have stayed since a Rs 50 hike in April last year.The hike comes after a phase of moderation in commercial LPG prices. Since April 2025, commercial cylinder rates had seen six reductions amounting to a cumulative cut of Rs 223 per cylinder, including small rollbacks in November and December.In contrast, Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) prices were reduced from January 1, offering some respite to airlines after months of elevated fuel costs. In Delhi, ATF prices were cut from Rs 864.35 to Rs 791.48 per kilolitre, a move expected to ease pressure on airline operating costs, where fuel accounts for nearly 40% of total expenses, according to ET. Indian Oil Corporation , Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum revise LPG and ATF prices on the first day of every month, based on international fuel prices and currency movements.","The price of a 19-kg commercial LPG cylinder has been hiked by Rs 111 nationwide.

'Really painful on the wallet'

Peak travel season

Caribbean air travel erupted into chaos over the weekend after US military captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, prompting sweeping airspace restrictions across the region.According to FlightRadar24, no commercial aircraft were flying over Venezuelan airspace on Saturday. The US Federal Aviation Administration also imposed restrictions that forced major airlines to cancel hundreds of flights across the eastern Caribbean, disrupting travel during an already busy holiday period. Airlines warned passengers that delays and cancellations could continue for several days.US transportation secretary Sean Duffy said the FAA acted in the interest of passenger safety. In a post on social media, he said “the FAA restricted the airspace in the Caribbean and Venezuela to ensure the SAFETY of the flying public.”“When appropriate, these airspace restrictions will be lifted,” he added on the social platform X. “Please work with your airlines directly if your flight has been impacted.”Services were cancelled or suspended to and from several major destinations, including:Airlines said they were waiving change fees for travellers forced to alter their plans.Aruba’s Queen Beatrix International Airport, located just 15 miles (24 kilometres) off Venezuela’s coast and popular with US holidaymakers, saw widespread cancellations on Saturday, according to airport authorities, normal operations were expected to resume on Sunday.The disruption extended beyond aviation. In Barbados, PM Mia Mottley said that the situation had affected both air and sea entry points. Speaking at a news conference, she said “the consequences of the conflict have been exceedingly disruptive to both of our ports of entry,” referring to the country’s airport and its cruise ship terminal.Earlier, the FAA said it had imposed a temporary airspace restriction affecting Puerto Rico’s main international airport and surrounding areas. A statement posted on X by Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan said the move was due to the “security situation related to military activity” in Venezuela.Most commercial flights operated by US airlines to and from the airport were suspended or cancelled as a result, although foreign airlines and military aircraft were exempt from the restriction.About 215 flights were cancelled “due to airspace closures across the Caribbean related to military activity.” However, services to destinations further west, including the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, were unaffected. Customers were offered rebooking options or refunds.Modifying its schedule to account for the closures and allowing passengers to change travel plans without fees as it continued to monitor the situation in coordination with US aviation authorities.Cancelled all flights to Aruba on Saturday and suspended services to Puerto Rico until further notice, while flights to the Dominican Republic continued.Waiving change fees for flights to and from around 20 island destinations, including Anguilla, Antigua, Curacao, Saint Lucia, and the US and British Virgin Islands.Issued a travel waiver for customers travelling through 13 affected airports until Tuesday.Cancelled flights affecting thousands of passengers but planned to resume services on Sunday to Curacao, Aruba, Bonaire and other Caribbean destinations.For many travellers, the impact was immediate. Lou Levine and his family were due to return to the Washington, DC, area from Puerto Rico on Saturday morning when they discovered their JetBlue flight had been cancelled. Attempts to rebook by phone failed, and the family later turned to social media for help.Eventually, JetBlue rebooked them on a flight departing the following Saturday, extending what was meant to be a week-long New Year holiday into a two-week stay.Levine said that his employer had been accommodating, but the disruption has come at a cost as his daughter will now miss a week of high school, and the family will have to undergo additional expenses.“I love it here. But we have dog-sitting and cat-sitting and car rental. It’s fine. It’s just really painful on the wallet,” Levine said.The family hopes to secure an earlier return if flights resume sooner.The cancellations came shortly after the peak holiday travel period, during which, according to AAA, nearly 122.4 million Americans travelled at least 50 miles from home. However, many travellers were still in the Caribbean, attempting to return ahead of work and school commitments.“The Caribbean is a top destination this time of the year,” said AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz. “We do have a lot of people who are trying to get back home this weekend ahead of work and school on Monday.”Diaz urged travellers to stay informed and allow airlines to send updates, noting that while “it’s understandable we want to unplug,” monitoring developments remains important.","US military captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, prompting sweeping airspace restrictions across the region.

India monitors crude oil buys from Russia

India is looking to seal a trade deal with the US and is monitoring weekly data on crude oil purchases from Russia and America, according to a Reuters report. Oil refiners have been asked to give details of crude purchases from Russia and the United States, the report added.The move comes as New Delhi works to advance trade negotiations with Washington and anticipates that imports of Russian crude could fall below one million barrels a day.The Donald Trump administration, which has been seeking to reduce its trade imbalance with India, last year raised tariffs on Indian goods to 50%, citing India’s substantial purchase of Russian oil. While New Delhi and Washington are in talks over a possible trade agreement, the discussions have faced periodic strains.Since the start of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, India has been the largest buyer of discounted Russian seaborne oil. However, this surge in purchases has drawn criticism from Western countries, which have imposed sanctions on Russia’s energy sector on the grounds that oil revenues are supporting Moscow’s war effort.Officials quoted in the report said that the government wants clear and reliable data to share with the United States.The Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell under the oil ministry has instructed refiners to report weekly figures for crude imports from Russia and the US.“We want timely and accurate data on Russian and US oil imports so that, when the US asks for information, we can provide verified figures instead of them relying on secondary sources,” a government official was quoted as saying by Reuters.Typically, the source of India’s crude imports is captured in monthly customs disclosures and by private data firms. The current request is the first instance of refiners being asked to submit such information on a weekly basis, the report added.Russian crude has emerged as a key sticking point in the complex trade negotiations between India and the United States. While several major economies have managed to reach agreements with Washington that eased the steep tariff levels initially imposed by US President Donald Trump, discussions with New Delhi have yet to yield a breakthrough.Talks broke down in late July after India pushed back against opening its agricultural markets to US products. Despite the setback of 50% tariffs, dialogue between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has continued and negotiations have since restarted.However, India’s continued purchases of Russian oil remain a major hurdle. Trump said in October that Modi had committed to ending imports of Russian crude, a claim New Delhi has publicly disputed, maintaining that supplies from Russia are critical to India’s energy needs.According to two government officials quoted by Reuters, refiners have not been formally directed to reduce their intake of Russian oil. Still, they and industry sources expect average imports to drop below one million barrels a day in the months ahead.Tighter sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union have already curbed Russian shipments to India. Data from analytics firm Kpler and industry sources show that inflows fell to around 1.2 million barrels per day in December, the lowest level in three years, representing about a 40 percent decline from a peak of roughly two million barrels a day in June.","India is looking to seal a trade deal with the US and is monitoring weekly data on crude oil purchases.

We’re going to sell it to them,” Trump said during the news conference. He added that oil companies will pay to rebuild Venezuela’s oil infrastructure.At the same time, he made it clear that US sanctions remain in place. “The embargo on all Venezuelan oil remains in full effect,” Trump said.Meanwhile, in a phone interview, President Donald Trump said the United States would ensure uninterrupted supply, dismissing concerns over China. Trump said he shared “very good relations” with Chinese President Xi Jinping and insisted there would be no problems with Beijing. “They will get the oil. We will let people have the oil,” he added.Venezuela has been under US oil sanctions since 2019 and currently produces about one million barrels of crude per day, much of which is sold on the black market at heavy discounts, as per AFP.Trump described Venezuela’s oil sector as a “total bust” for years despite holding the world’s largest proven crude reserves.He said the proposed US “partnership” would make Venezuelans “rich, independent and safe”, adding that Venezuelans living in the US would be “extremely happy” and “not going to suffer any more”, reported AFP.The president repeated similar remarks in a television interview, saying the US would be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry, without spelling out the details.Venezuela’s proven reserves are estimated at around 303 billion barrels, accounting for about 17 per cent of global reserves, as per The Hill.Trump’s comments came hours after Washington announced it had captured Maduro in an overnight military operation.Maduro and his wife were taken from a military base and flown out of the country aboard a US warship, with Trump saying they were headed to New York to face criminal charges.He also said the US planned to run Venezuela temporarily until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” of power could take place, reported AP.As part of a weeks-long military pressure campaign ahead of the raid, US forces seized at least two oil tankers that Washington said were operating in violation of sanctions.Trump also issued a warning to other political and military figures in Venezuela, saying “what happened to Maduro can happen to them,” according to AFP.He again accused Caracas of using oil revenues to finance “drug terrorism, human trafficking, murder and kidnapping”, allegations long denied by the Venezuelan government, as per AFP.Trump said he personally watched the military operation in real time and praised it as “extremely successful”, adding that US forces were prepared for further action if required.While US oil major Chevron already operates in Venezuela under limited sanctions waivers, Trump’s remarks signal a far deeper American role in the country’s energy sector once political control is restructured.

Pharma generics: Semaglutide patent expiry to open Rs 50-billion opportunity; Indian players eye FY27 boost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pharma-generics-semaglutide-patent-expiry-to-open-rs-50-billion-opportunity-indian-players-eye-fy27-boost/articleshow/126324099.cms,"Representative image

The impending patent expiry of semaglutide drugs across India, emerging markets and select regulated markets such as Canada and Brazil is expected to create a revenue opportunity of more than Rs 50 billion for generic pharmaceutical companies over the next 12 to 15 months, according to an industry update by Systematix Institutional Research.The report said the opportunity is likely to be shared among 10 to 15 Indian and global generic players. For FY27, incremental revenues are estimated at Rs 10–20 billion from India’s branded formulations market, about Rs 45 billion from regulated markets including Canada and Brazil, and Rs 5–10 billion from emerging markets.While regulated markets could deliver a sharp near-term boost, analysts cautioned that the upside may moderate over time due to pricing pressure and rising competition.In India, the launch of generic semaglutide, expected in the first quarter of FY27, is projected to lift overall Indian Pharmaceutical Market growth by 0.5–1%, reported news agency ANI.Prices are expected to be 30–50% lower initially compared to current levels, with deeper cuts of up to 70–75% over time. This is likely to significantly accelerate the adoption of GLP-1 therapies among diabetic patients.Market leadership in the GLP-1 segment is expected to remain concentrated among five to ten players.Currently, Alkem Laboratories, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Sun Pharma have secured regulatory approvals in India, while other players are awaiting clearances.Zydus Lifesciences is pursuing a differentiated injectable version, which could provide a competitive edge despite its smaller diabetes franchise, the report noted.In regulated markets, the combined semaglutide market in Canada and Brazil is estimated at nearly $2 billion annually.Assuming 50% price erosion and 50% market share capture by generics, the addressable opportunity could be around $500 million.Analysts said timely regulatory approvals will be crucial, with Dr Reddy’s potentially emerging as the first Indian entrant in Canada and Sun Pharma enjoying a first-mover advantage in Brazil.Emerging markets are expected to offer steadier, longer-term growth with lower regulatory risks. Companies such as Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s, Alkem, Biocon and OneSource Specialty Pharma are seen as well placed to benefit, aided by their existing diabetes portfolios and partnerships.Ancillary players such as Shaily Engineering Plastics could also gain, as demand rises for pen devices used in injectable therapies, as per ANI.","The opportunity is likely to be shared among 10 to 15 Indian and global generic players.

EMERGENCY In Venezuela: Maduro ACTIVATES Defence Command, Sends Troops As Trump INVADES

As the United States carried out strikes on Venezuela on Saturday, global oil markets are closely watching for any fallout, though early signals point to limited disruption so far.Venezuela holds some of the world’s largest proven oil reserves, raising concerns that military action could disrupt global price movements. However, crude markets have remained subdued as the country’s oil exports were already constrained by US sanctions, limiting its role in global supply chains.According to Reuters, Venezuela’s state-run energy company PDVSA said oil production and refining operations were running normally, and that its most important facilities had not suffered damage from the US attacks. Two sources, quoted by Reuters, familiar with PDVSA’s operations said the country’s key oil infrastructure remained unaffected.Reuters also reported that the port of La Guaira near Caracas suffered severe damage during the attacks, though the port is not used for oil exports.For India, the impact is expected to be minimal, according to former Indian Ambassador to Venezuela R Viswanathan told ANI that India is not dependent on Venezuelan oil and that trade between the two countries remains limited.He added that India has some investment through ONGC in Venezuelan oil fields, but the developments are unlikely to affect India in any significant way.""It was not a surprise... this is not the first time he had threatened. When he was President for the first time, at that time also he had threatened Venezuela... This time he has sent the warships and he has authorized the CIA... No, it will not affect India,"" he said.Further explaining his stance, he added, ""We are not dependent on Venezuela for oil. Our trade is very little and we have some investment by ONGC in their oil fields... So, this is not going to affect India in any big way.""US President Donald Trump said American forces had captured President Nicolás Maduro following months of pressure over allegations of drug trafficking and illegitimacy in power. However, after the attacks, Trump announced that US is going to be heavily involved in the Venezuela's oil industry. """"We have ‌the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, ‍the greatest, and ‍we're going ⁠to ⁠be very much involved in it,"" he told Fox News.Before this, in December, Trump had announced a blockade of oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela, a move that has already weighed heavily on the country’s crude exports.The US seizure of two Venezuelan oil cargoes and the tanker blockade reduced Venezuela’s exports last month to about half of the 950,000 barrels per day it shipped in November, as reporter by Reuters earlier. The measures have also prompted many vessel owners to divert away from Venezuelan waters, forcing PDVSA to store crude on tankers and slow deliveries at ports. At the time, global data and analytics firm Kpler had said the market remains well supplied, even within sanctioned segments, limiting the price impact of further disruptions.Kpler estimated Venezuela currently produces about 900,000 barrels per day of crude and condensate, roughly 1 per cent of global supply. Of the approximately 765,000 barrels per day that Venezuela exports, about 76 per cent is shipped to China, mainly to independent refiners, as state-owned companies avoided sanctioned cargoes.","Venezuela's state-run energy company PDVSA said oil production and refining operations were running normally, and that its most important facilities had not suffered damage from the US attacks.

FII flows 2026: Foreign investors extend selling streak in early sessions; analysts expect turnaround later this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fii-flows-2026-foreign-investors-extend-selling-streak-in-early-sessions-analysts-expect-turnaround-later-this-year/articleshow/126323442.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: ANI)

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have begun 2026 on a cautious note, continuing their selling streak in Indian equities after a bruising 2025.In the first two trading sessions of the new year, FIIs sold shares worth Rs 7,608 crore, extending a trend that saw heavy outflows through December, as per ET.FIIs were net sellers throughout December, offloading Indian equities worth Rs 22,611 crore during the month. This took the total foreign outflow for 2025 to Rs 1,66,286 crore.According to market participants, the scale of sales last year was unprecedented.V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Investments, described 2025 as the worst phase of FII selling since overseas investors began investing in Indian markets, reported ET.He noted that during the calendar year 2025, FIIs sold equities worth Rs 2.40 lakh crore in the secondary market. However, investments of Rs 73,909 crore through the primary market helped soften the overall impact.Even so, December alone saw secondary market selling of Rs 30,332 crore, underlining the persistent pressure on equities.Explaining the reasons behind the sustained exit, Vijayakumar pointed to relatively high valuations in India and the global shift towards artificial intelligence-linked trades as key drivers.He also said the relentless selling contributed to weakness in the rupee.The Indian currency emerged as the worst-performing major currency in 2025, depreciating nearly 5% against the US dollar over the year, as per ET.A closer look at quarterly flows shows how uneven FII behaviour was during the year. Foreign investors pulled out Rs 1,16,574 crore in the January–March quarter, setting a sharply negative tone.This was followed by a brief reversal in April–June, when inflows stood at Rs 38,673 crore.Despite the weak start to 2026, market experts believe the outlook could improve over the year. Vijayakumar expects a shift in FII strategy as India’s fundamentals strengthen.“Significant improvement in India’s fundamentals are likely to attract net FII inflows in 2026.Robust GDP growth and prospects of improvement in corporate earnings in 2026 augur well for positive FII flows in 2026,” he said, as quoted by ET.Nilesh Jain, head vice president – equity research at Centrum Broking, also struck an optimistic note. He expects 2026 to be better than the previous year and has pegged the Nifty’s December 2026 target at 29,731, implying a potential upside of 13%.He attributed this view to improving macro indicators, stronger GDP growth, easing inflation and an end to corporate earnings downgrades.Jain added that India underperformed global emerging markets in 2025, delivering its weakest relative performance in three decades.Rupee depreciation, persistent FII selling and high US tariffs of 50% weighed on sentiment, with no trade deal reached by year-end.","FIIs were net sellers throughout December, offloading Indian equities worth Rs 22,611 crore.

Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday urged states to adopt a strategic approach to budget utilisation, warning that delays in spending allocated funds result in losses for states and hamper the timely release of subsequent central instalments.Addressing a review meeting with state agriculture ministers, Chouhan said states must ensure funds earmarked for various schemes are spent before March to avoid administrative bottlenecks that delay the effective implementation of programmes.""If states are unable to spend their budgets on time, it only results in losses for them,"" the minister said, adding that budget allocations are often held up due to minor administrative and procedural issues.The meeting reviewed the progress and budget utilisation of central agriculture schemes, including the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (PM-RKVY) and Krishonnati Yojana (KY).Chouhan stressed the need for prompt verification of eligible farmers under the PM-KISAN scheme, expanding coverage under the crop insurance scheme, and ensuring timely settlement of claims. He also emphasised the importance of seed and fertiliser availability, their balanced use, and strengthening central-state coordination.The meeting was attended by agriculture ministers from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Mizoram, along with Agriculture Secretary Devesh Chaturvedi, and senior ministry officials.Chouhan assured states that the Centre will continue to provide support to strengthen the agriculture sector and safeguard farmers' interests, an official statement said.",Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan urged states to adopt a strategic approach to budget utilisation.

"India Equity Strategy 2026: Capex revival likely to gain momentum; defence, capital goods, infrastructure set to benefit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-equity-strategy-2026-capex-revival-likely-to-gain-momentum-defence-capital-goods-infrastructure-set-to-benefit/articleshow/126322088.cms,"AI image

India’s capital expenditure upcycle is showing early but credible signs of revival, with several investment-linked sectors likely to benefit over the next two to three years, according to Antique Stock Broking’s India Equity Strategy 2026.Improving macroeconomic conditions, policy support and rising private and household investment are laying the groundwork for a broader capex recovery.As per news agency PTI, the report identifies defence as one of the strongest structural beneficiaries of the capex push, driven by higher budgetary allocations, a strong order pipeline and continued emphasis on indigenisation under the Atmanirbhar Bharat programme.Export opportunities are also expanding, providing an additional growth lever.Capital goods companies are expected to see outsized earnings growth as fresh order inflows coincide with high operating leverage, with the report noting that even modest revenue growth could translate into sharp profit expansion.Industrial and electronics manufacturing services are also positioned to gain from domestic capex and global supply-chain diversification.As multinational firms pursue “China+1” strategies, India is emerging as a preferred manufacturing base, supporting demand for industrial equipment and electronics, according to PTI.The gradual return of private investment is expected to benefit infrastructure developers and engineering players, particularly those linked to roads, railways, power and urban infrastructure, while lower interest rates and improved affordability are reviving housing demand.Alongside the capex theme, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) could stage a comeback in Indian equities in 2026 after record outflows last year. As per ANI, FPIs pulled out about $17.5 billion in 2025, the highest annual outflow on record.Antique said CY26 could see a revival as earnings visibility improves, valuations turn reasonable and macro stability strengthens.Corporate earnings are projected to re-accelerate, with Nifty earnings expected to grow around 16% CAGR over FY26–FY28, compared with about 7% over the previous two years.However, the report cautioned that global investor preference for AI-exposed markets remains a risk, potentially leading to sectoral divergence within Indian equities.",India’s capital expenditure upcycle is showing early but credible signs of revival.

India has set up 132 Compressed Bio Gas (CBG) plants with a combined production capacity of 920 tonnes perday, with more capacity being added under the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative, Union petroleum and natural gas minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on X.In a social media post, the minister said the CBG programme is helping convert farm and organic waste into clean fuel while supporting rural incomes and lowering emissions.“What was once waste is now powering progress. India has 132 Compressed Bio Gas plants producing 920 TPD today, with more capacity coming up under SATAT,” Puri wrote.SATAT was launched on October 1, 2018, with the objective of creating an ecosystem for producing CBG from waste and biomass sources across the country.Under the initiative, oil and gas marketing companies such as IOCL , BPCL, HPCL, GAIL and IGL have invited expressions of interest from entrepreneurs to procure CBG for marketing, according to news agency ANI.Separately, the minister also highlighted recent steps taken to boost India’s domestic energy production.Puri said that in December 2025, India offered 50 new exploration and production blocks covering oil, gas and coal bed methane assets, describing it as a significant step towards strengthening energy security.“We are offering 50 new E&P blocks across Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP-X): 25 blocks, Discovered Small Field (DSF-IV): 55 fields across 9 contract areas/blocks. Special CBM Bid Rounds 2025 and 2026: 3 blocks (2025) & 13 blocks (2026),” the minister said in his post.Under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy, 25 blocks covering around 1.83 lakh square kilometres are on offer, including onland, shallow water, deepwater and ultra-deepwater blocks.Puri said these blocks allow exploration throughout the contract period, graded royalty rates and flexibility in work programmes.The Discovered Small Field Bid Round-IV includes 55 discoveries across nine contract areas, with incentives such as zero royalty for the first seven years in deepwater areas and relaxed eligibility norms.Similar incentives apply to coal-bed methane rounds, including pricing freedom and cost reimbursement for mandated drilling in the 2026 round, as per ANI.Puri also said the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Act, 2025 and the PNG Rules 2025 have introduced a unified regulatory framework to improve ease of doing business in the sector.","India has set up 132 Compressed Bio Gas (CBG) plants with a combined production capacity of 920 tonnes perday.

US-EU trade: Italian pasta no longer faces 107% tariff; final rates to be announced in March,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-eu-trade-italian-pasta-no-longer-faces-107-tariff-final-rates-to-be-announced-in-march/articleshow/126319884.cms,"The US commerce department is preparing to ease the steep tariffs planned on Italian pasta imports, reducing the duties proposed earlier this year.Italian pasta had been facing one of the highest tariff burdens among European food products entering the United States. While most European Union goods are already subject to duties of at least 15%, pasta exports from Italy were initially set to attract an additional 92% levy, taking the total tariff rate to 107%. Under the revised proposal, the duties are now expected to fall within a range of 24% to 29%.The commerce department said the final tariff rates would be announced on March 12, following a review process detailed in a post-preliminary report released on Wednesday. The investigation was launched to examine claims that some Italian producers were selling pasta in the US market at unfairly low prices.A commerce department official told CNN that the reduction followed an “evaluation of additional comments received following a preliminary determination.”“Italian pasta makers have addressed many of commerce’s concerns raised in the preliminary determination, and reflects commerce’s commitment to a fair, transparent process,” the official added.The case involves 13 Italian pasta manufacturers and stems from an antidumping complaint filed in July by two US-based companies, 8th Avenue Food & Provisions and Winland Foods. The companies accused several Italian exporters of undercutting prices on pasta shipped to the United States.In preliminary findings issued in September, the commerce department said two firms, La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, sold pasta in the US “at less than normal value.” The report also described both companies as “uncooperative” during the probe, stating that the information they provided was “incomplete and unreliable.”The department noted that these two producers accounted for the largest share of Italian pasta exports to the US market. Neither company responded immediately to CNN’s request for comment.Italy’s ministry of foreign affairs welcomed the latest development, saying the revised tariff outlook reflected improved cooperation. “The redetermination of the tariffs is a sign of the recognition by US authorities of our companies’ willingness to cooperate,” the ministry said.","Italian pasta had been facing one of the highest tariff burdens among European food products entering the United States.

Affordability crisis in New York: Zohran Mamdani's focus on rising rents & more — how will the new mayor handle it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/affordability-crisis-in-new-york-zohran-mamdanis-focus-on-rising-rents-more-how-will-the-new-mayor-handle-it/articleshow/126316528.cms,"Zohran Mamdani Takes Oath On Quran In Historic First As New York Muslim Mayor | WATCH

Zohran Mamdani is set to begin a new mayoral term after a historic election that gave him the highest vote count for a New York City mayor in 60 years.After winning with a campaign focused on working-class issues, he now faces the challenge of delivering on his promises as living costs remain at record highs, economic growth shows signs of slowing, federal support weakens and budget pressures mount.Housing remains the most severe strain on household finances. More than half of a typical family’s income goes towards rent, while about 100,000 people rely on homeless shelters each night, according to CNN. In Manhattan, median monthly rents have crossed $5,400. “This is what a full-blown affordability crisis looks like,” Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said in a December report.Central to Mamdani’s agenda is a pledge to freeze rents in rent-stabilised apartments, a policy he has described as his “landmark policy”. Nearly one million apartments, close to half of the city’s rental housing, would be affected. However, nonprofit housing providers and developers operating subsidised units say that existing revenues are already insufficient to meet operating costs.Simultaneously, the rising cost of daily necessities has pushed many residents into financial distress. Around 1.4 million people, roughly 15% of the city’s population, face food insecurity.Child care costs are also among the highest in the country, with a family required to earn $334,000 annually to afford care for a two-year-old, according to US Census Bureau data.Data from Community Preservation Corporation shows that since 2020, expenses for rent-stabilised housing have increased by 22%, while rents have risen by only about 11%. Industry experts warn that the gap between costs and income could lead to worsening building conditions as expenses for insurance, labour and utilities continue to rise.Alongside rent control, Mamdani has proposed the construction of 200,000 permanently subsidised affordable homes aimed at low- and moderate-income residents. Yet financial stress within the affordable housing sector is already evident. “The trends of increasing costs and reduced income are unsustainable for affordable housing,” Enterprise Community Partners and National Equity Fund said in a recent report, calling for emergency funding and state intervention to curb insurance expenses.Beyond housing, Mamdani has committed to free child care for children aged six weeks to five years and removing fares from city-run buses. Funding these initiatives depends on state approval to increase taxes on high-income residents and corporations. New York governor Kathy Hochul has publicly opposed making the entire bus network free, citing the potential $1 billion loss in fare revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Whether Mamdani can turn this proposal into policy will depend on political pressure from his support base, according to Columbia University historian Kim Phillips-Fein. His grassroots campaign has already inspired allies to launch a nonprofit organisation aimed at pressing city and state lawmakers in Albany. “People thought Mamdani’s election was impossible a year ago, but it was accomplished through significant political organizing,” Phillips-Fein said. His success as mayor “will depend upon an alignment of political forces and continued organizing.”Economic indicators present both strength and concern. While opponents warned before the election of a potential flight of wealthy residents or a repeat of the city’s 1970s fiscal collapse, Phillips-Fein told CNN that such comparisons are “shallow”. Unlike that period, New York is not experiencing population loss or a decline in manufacturing jobs.Employment and labour force participation remain at record levels, tax revenues are at historic highs and office leasing reached 97% of pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2025. However, momentum is slowing. The city is projected to add 78,000 fewer jobs in 2025 than the previous year, with most gains concentrated in the low-wage home health sector, according to Sarah Parker of the New York City Independent Budget Office.At the same time, a $6.5 billion budget shortfall is expected in 2027, with larger gaps forecast in subsequent years. The incoming administration is “facing a pretty challenging fiscal picture,” Parker said.Federal policy is likely to shape the city’s outlook. Mamdani has vowed to pursue “the most ambitious agenda to tackle the cost-of-living crisis this city has seen since the days of Fiorello La Guardia”, but unlike La Guardia’s era, current federal leadership has moved to cut key social programmes, CNN reported.State estimates suggest that Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill will lead to 1.5 million New Yorkers losing health insurance coverage, 300,000 households losing some or all SNAP benefits, $13 billion in cuts to the state’s healthcare system and 200,000 job losses, alongside higher long-term energy costs due to the cancellation of clean energy projects.Although Mamdani and US President Donald Trump held a meeting at the White House in November, the administration is withholding $18 billion in federal funding for New York City transit projects. Tariffs, immigration restrictions and reduced federal spending create a “challenging climate for cities like New York,” City Comptroller Brad Lander said in a December report, as cited by CNN. Meamwhile, Mamdani has maintained confidence that progress is possible. “I’m really looking forward to delivering for New Yorkers in partnership with the president on the affordability agenda.”","Zohran Mamdani is set to begin a new mayoral term after a historic election that gave him the highest vote count for a New York City mayor in 60 years.

The deal involved aerospace and defense specialist Emcore Corp. selling its computer chips and wafer fabrication operations to HieFo for $2.92 million - a price that included the assumption of about $1 million in liabilities.But Trump is now demanding that HieFo divest that technology within 180 days, citing ""credible evidence"" that the current owner is a citizen of the People's Republic of China.HieFo was founded by Genzao Zhang and Harry Moore. According to a press release that came out after the deal closed, plans for the technology acquired from Emcore were to be overseen by largely the same team of employees in Alhambra, California.Zhang, who was a vice president of engineering at Emcore before becoming HieFo's CEO, pledged to ""continue the pursuit of the most innovative and disruptive solutions"" with technology designed for purposes that would include artificial intelligence.HieFo didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's order.Emcore was a publicly traded company at the time of the HieFo deal, but was taken private last year by the investment firm Charlesbank Capital Partner.","The deal involved aerospace and defense specialist Emcore Corp. selling its computer chips and wafer fabrication operations to HieFo for $2.92 million.

EV race: Tesla loses top spot after second year of delivery decline; BYD overtakes in global sales,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ev-race-tesla-loses-top-spot-after-second-year-of-delivery-decline-byd-overtakes-in-global-sales/articleshow/126309001.cms,"Tesla Launches First Showroom in India at Mumbai's BKC | Cheapest EV Model Y Costs...

Tesla has lost its position as the world’s largest electric vehicle maker after deliveries fell for a second consecutive year in 2025, weighed down by intensifying competition and weakening demand in key markets, AP reported.The US electric carmaker said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, a decline of 9 per cent from the previous year. Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million electric vehicles last year, has now overtaken Tesla as the world’s biggest EV manufacturer.Fourth-quarter deliveries stood at 418,227 vehicles, below the 440,000 units expected by analysts polled by FactSet. Sales in the quarter were also hit by the expiry of a $7,500 US federal tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.Tesla shares were largely unchanged in early trade on Friday at $450.27, as investors continued to look beyond near-term sales pressures. The stock ended 2025 up about 11 per cent, reflecting optimism around the company’s longer-term strategy.Despite declining vehicle sales, investors are betting on chief executive Elon Musk ’s push to reposition Tesla as a leader in autonomous mobility and robotics. Musk has repeatedly said that future growth will be driven by robotaxi services, energy storage and humanoid robots designed for use in homes and factories.The fourth quarter marked the first full period of sales for stripped-down, lower-priced versions of the Model Y and Model 3, unveiled in early October to revive demand. The new Model Y is priced just under $40,000, while the cheaper Model 3 starts below $37,000. These models are expected to help Tesla compete more aggressively with Chinese EV makers in Europe and Asia.Looking ahead, analysts expect pressure on financial performance to continue in the near term. For the fourth-quarter results due in late January, Tesla is forecast to report a 3 per cent drop in revenue and a nearly 40 per cent fall in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts, however, expect sales and profits to stabilise and begin recovering as 2026 progresses.Musk has argued that falling car sales are less critical to Tesla’s long-term outlook, as the company pivots towards new technologies and business lines.

Did you know that the world’s wealthiest and richest 500 people added a whopping $2.2 trillion to their wealth in 2025? The rise was a result of powerful rallies across global markets ranging from stocks and digital assets to precious metals, data from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. As a result, the aggregate net worth expanded to $11.9 trillion in 2025.Technology billionaires were at the forefront of the advance, with sustained enthusiasm around artificial intelligence driving gains in US mega-cap shares. Roughly 25% of the total increase tracked by Bloomberg’s index was generated by just eight people.Among them were Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk , Alphabet co-founder Larry Page and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Even so, their share of overall gains was smaller than a year earlier, when the same group accounted for 43%.This surge got a booster shot after Donald Trump ’s victory in the US presidential election in late 2024, while concerns over tariffs caused only a brief interruption. In April, a sharp market selloff triggered the largest single-day erosion of billionaire wealth since the pandemic, but the setback proved temporary.At the start of the year, Musk stood clearly apart as the most prominent figure among the ultra-wealthy.He stepped into the political arena in a significant way after contributing close to $300 million to Trump’s re-election bid and spent much of early 2025 in Washington, DC, leading efforts aimed at reducing government spending.By year-end, however, it was Ellison who emerged as the standout. A sharp rise in Oracle’s share price, driven by increased investment in artificial intelligence by the cloud computing firm, briefly pushed him past Musk in September to become the world’s richest person. Although Oracle stock later retreated by about 40% from its highs, Ellison remained in the spotlight due to his role in the Paramount Skydance Corp. offer, led by his son David Ellison, to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.The wealth expansion was not limited to the US. While the S&P 500 Index gained 17% for the year through December 30, it lagged behind a 22% rise in Britain’s FTSE 100 and a 29% advance in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index.Performance across other asset classes was even stronger. Precious metals delivered one of their strongest showings in decades as investors sought safety, while copper and rare earths gained strategic importance amid geopolitical tensions. This boosted the fortunes of major commodity holders such as Australian mining tycoon Gina Rinehart and Chile’s Luksic family by billions of dollars.Cryptocurrencies also appeared set to outperform equities for much of the year. Bitcoin jumped to record levels following Trump’s election victory and extended its rally after the administration rolled out policies seen as supportive of the sector. That momentum reversed sharply in October, when a steep selloff erased all earlier gains and more, sharply cutting the wealth of crypto-focused billionaires including the Winklevoss twins, Changpeng Zhao and Michael Saylor.At 81, the Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has stepped more deeply into the company’s daily operations, steering its aggressive and highly leveraged expansion into artificial intelligence infrastructure. Ellison’s personal wealth jumped sharply on September 10, rising by $89 billion in a single day after Oracle posted blockbuster quarterly results linked to its AI strategy. This marked the largest one-day increase in net worth recorded by Bloomberg’s wealth index at the time.Beyond technology, Ellison has been channeling capital into the media space, including personally backing the equity component of his son David’s $108 billion hostile bid for Warner Bros. Oracle’s ambition to play a central role in the proposed $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure initiative, along with plans to take an ownership stake in TikTok’s US business, could further influence Ellison’s fortune well into 2026 and beyond.Elon Musk emerged as the largest political contributor during the 2024 election cycle and spent much of the spring in Washington, where his Department of Government Efficiency drove deep budget cuts and large-scale workforce reductions across federal agencies. That period weighed on his personal wealth, as Tesla shares came under pressure, partly reflecting consumer backlash against his political involvement.His fortunes improved after he exited the White House following a very public rift with Donald Trump. A recent insider transaction at SpaceX lifted the company’s valuation to the highest level ever for a private firm, pushing Musk’s net worth past the $600 billion mark for the first time. Separately, Tesla investors approved a revised pay package that positions him to potentially become the world’s first trillionaire, provided the electric vehicle maker achieves an ambitious set of performance milestones in the years ahead.Australia’s wealthiest individual emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the global push to secure access to strategically critical rare-earth minerals. Through her privately owned firm Hancock Prospecting, Rinehart has built the largest rare-earth holdings outside China, placing her at the center of an intensifying geopolitical contest over materials that underpin industries such as semiconductors and electric vehicles.Her influence has extended beyond mining. Rinehart has appeared at events hosted at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and holds an investment in Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the listed company that operates the social media platform Truth Social. In the three months through June 30, she expanded that stake by roughly two-thirds.Since launching his campaign for a second term, Donald Trump and his family have pursued a wide range of commercial ventures that have significantly boosted their collective wealth, reaching levels rarely seen in modern US political history. Despite a recent pullback, the family’s fortune has risen by around 70% over the past 15 months.In the period leading up to Trump’s second inauguration, he and First Lady Melania Trump promoted two memecoins branded with their names. While those tokens initially surged before retreating, the Trump-branded coin alone has contributed more than $200 million to the family’s net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Weeks before the 2024 election, Trump also helped launch the crypto platform World Liberty Financial alongside his sons. Since then, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have expanded into digital asset ventures, including cryptocurrency mining company American Bitcoin Corp.A major holding for the family, their stake in Trump Media, jumped in value in December following the announcement of a merger with nuclear fusion firm TAE Technologies, though the shares remain more than 70% below their January peak. Trump also notched a legal win in August when an appeals court overturned a $464 million civil fraud penalty, even as it upheld findings that he had violated the law by overstating the value of assets such as the Mar-a-Lago resort.Manuel Villar, who previously held the title of the Philippines’ richest individual, suffered a dramatic erosion of wealth after shares of his real estate firm, Golden MV Holdings Inc., collapsed shortly after trading resumed in November. The stock fell by more than 80% within days of the end of a six-month suspension, wiping out over $18 billion from Villar’s fortune.The trading halt had been imposed when Golden MV failed to submit financial statements following disclosures that the company had purchased a parcel of land from Villar for $93 million, only to later mark its value at over $23 billion. Adding to the pressure, Villar earlier this month exited his entire holding in water utility PrimeWater, selling the stake to retail magnate Lucio Co. PrimeWater had come under government scrutiny in July over alleged “irregularities. ”The long-anticipated revival in US initial public offerings suffered a setback with the underwhelming market debut of liquefied natural gas exporter Venture Global Inc. After several slow years for new listings, the company’s January IPO was widely seen as a potential catalyst for a stronger issuance pipeline, supported by a pro-business administration and a sizable backlog of deals.Ahead of the flotation, co-founders Bob Pender and Mike Sabel were expected to each hold equity stakes valued at close to $30 billion, as Venture Global was positioned to deliver the largest energy IPO in more than a decade. That optimism quickly faded. Weak investor appetite forced the company to scale back the offering, and the share price has since plunged more than 70%, weighed down by underwhelming quarterly results and the loss of a major arbitration case against BP Plc, one of its largest customers.For much of the first half of the year, Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. stood out as a major beneficiary of the cryptocurrency boom. Digital assets surged to record levels following Donald Trump’s election victory in November 2024 and extended those gains as the new administration implemented a series of policies supportive of the sector. Strategy was at the forefront of the so-called crypto treasury approach, accumulating large quantities of Bitcoin on its balance sheet while repeatedly issuing equity to fund further purchases.That strategy delivered outsized gains through early October, when Bitcoin reached new peaks. Momentum then reversed. A sharp pullback in the cryptocurrency triggered a steep sell-off in Strategy’s shares, which fell by more than 50%, erasing nearly $6 billion from Saylor’s wealth compared with its earlier high.Wang Xing, co-founder and chairman of Meituan, experienced a significant drop in personal wealth during 2025 as pressures mounted on China’s leading food delivery company. His net worth slid close to 31% after Meituan reported its first quarterly loss in nearly three years in November.The setback came despite a strong year for Chinese equities, with the Shanghai Composite Index rising 18%. Meituan has been weighed down by softer domestic consumer spending and intensifying competition from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. To counter slowing growth at home, the company has accelerated its push into international markets, recently expanding operations into Brazil and the Middle East.","The world’s wealthiest and richest 500 people added a whopping $2.2 trillion to their wealth in 2025.

"Global investing outlook 2026: Why investors may look beyond the US; how AI, rate cuts and a softer dollar will shape returns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-investing-outlook-2026-why-investors-may-look-beyond-the-us-how-ai-rate-cuts-and-a-softer-dollar-will-shape-returns/articleshow/126290387.cms,"Global investment opportunities are set to widen meaningfully in 2026 as easing monetary policy, a weakening US dollar and profit growth outside the United States reshape capital flows, according to Franklin Templeton report.The asset manager report titled 'Global Investment Outlook 2026 and Beyond' said that lobal markets are entering a phase where returns are likely to “broaden” across regions and asset classes, moving away from the US-centric leadership seen in recent years, even as American equities — particularly technology stocks — remain resilient.""“In 2026, we foresee broadening opportunities across global capital markets, driven by attractive profits growth outside the United States and by global monetary policy easing,” the report said.Franklin Templeton identified three cyclical forces defining the near-term landscape — broadening, steepening and weakening. Broadening reflects expanding opportunities across geographies and asset classes; steepening points to yield curves as short-term rates fall faster than long-term yields; and weakening refers to the US dollar, which the firm expects to remain under pressure.Yield curves are likely to steepen as central banks cut policy rates, reducing the appeal of cash and pushing investors towards equities, credit and longer-duration fixed income.“Falling short-term interest rates will incentivise investors to move out of cash holdings and into risk assets,” the report said, adding that cyclically sensitive sectors such as financials, industrials and smaller companies could benefit.The US Federal Reserve resumed rate cuts in September 2025 after a nine-month pause and is expected to continue easing into the first half of 2026, even as inflation remains above target. Franklin Templeton said this policy backdrop reinforces its broadening thesis, encouraging investors to look beyond traditional safe assets.The US dollar has already fallen about 10% on a trade-weighted basis this year, and the report suggested the decline may not be over. “Weakening of the US dollar tends to reinforce a broadening of returns across capital markets, by region, sector, and asset class,” it said, highlighting positive implications for emerging market debt and equities.Looking beyond 2026, Franklin Templeton outlined three long-term themes likely to shape portfolios over the coming half-decade — the Age of Intelligence, the mainstreaming of private markets and an era of big government.Artificial intelligence remains central to the long-term investment case, but the report stressed that AI deployment is still in its early stages. “Its contribution to growth, social welfare, and investment returns is just beginning,” Franklin Templeton said, pointing to continued opportunities in data centres, advanced semiconductors and AI-enabling infrastructure.A key constraint — and opportunity — lies in energy. “One of the most compelling investment themes is the need to ‘feed the beast’ to sate AI’s vast energy appetite,” the report noted, flagging rising electricity demand and spillover benefits for engineering, industrial metals and power infrastructure.Private markets are also expected to play a larger role as investors search for income and diversification in a lower-rate environment. Franklin Templeton identified commercial real estate debt, infrastructure and secondary private equity offerings as preferred areas as cash yields decline.At the same time, the report struck a note of caution, warning that rising government intervention could dampen returns. “We have entered an era of big and intrusive government, which risks lowering returns and increasing risk across capital markets over the remainder of this decade,” it said.Franklin Templeton said investors will need to adapt portfolios to a world where leadership is more dispersed, policy uncertainty remains elevated and innovation — particularly in technology, private assets and digital finance — continues to be the dominant long-term driver of returns.","Global investment opportunities are set to widen meaningfully in 2026, according to Franklin Templeton report.

Healthcare shock for Americans! Medical insurance subsidies expired; millions stuck with hiked premiums,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/healthcare-shock-for-americans-medical-insurance-subsidies-expired-millions-stuck-with-hiked-premiums/articleshow/126288936.cms,"Millions of Americans face higher healthcare costs as enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits expired on January 1, 2026, despite efforts from both Republicans and Democrats to find a solution. The expiration affects over 20 million people who rely on these subsidies, with average premium costs more than doubling for most enrollees.The subsidies were part of the original Affordable Care Act passed during the Obama administration and were later enhanced during the Covid-19 pandemic to boost financial assistance for those already eligible and to expand coverage to more Americans. First introduced in 2021 as a temporary pandemic-era measure, the enhanced subsidies were extended by Democrats in power at the time, pushing their expiration to the start of 2026. The subsidies helped lower-income enrollees get free coverage and ensured higher earners paid no more than 8.5 per cent of their income for health insurance.The political battle to save these subsidies led to a 43-day government shutdown, but the two opposing parties could reach an agreement. A House vote expected in January 2026 offers another chance, though success remains uncertain.""It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,"" said Katelin Provost, a 37-year-old single mom whose monthly premium is jumping from $85 to nearly $750, as quoted by the Associated Press.Stan Clawson, a 49-year-old freelance filmmaker in Salt Lake City living with paralysis, saw his monthly premiums increase from $350 to nearly $500. He's choosing to absorb the cost due to his medical needs.Health experts warn that many younger, healthier Americans might drop coverage altogether due to the higher costs. The Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund predict about 4.8 million Americans will lose coverage in 2026. This could make the program more expensive for older, sicker participants who remain.Some affected individuals are making tough choices. Provost plans to drop her own coverage while maintaining insurance for her four-year-old daughter if Congress doesn't restore the subsidies soon.Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old enrollee from Wisconsin, expressed frustration with the political gridlock: ""Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it. They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.""The issue remains particularly important as the country enters a crucial midterm election year, with healthcare affordability ranking high among voters' concerns.","Extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits expired on January 1, 2026.

Euro switch: Bulgaria joins the euro nearly two decades after EU entry; cheers mix with fears over prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/euro-switch-bulgaria-joins-the-euro-nearly-two-decades-after-eu-entry-cheers-mix-with-fears-over-prices/articleshow/126286270.cms,"Bulgaria on Thursday adopted the euro as its official currency, becoming the 21st country to join the eurozone, a long-anticipated milestone that comes almost 20 years after the Balkan nation entered the European Union, but one that has exposed deep political and public divisions.At midnight, Bulgaria formally gave up the lev, which had been in use since the late 19th century, marking the transition with projections of Bulgarian euro coins on the central bank’s building in Sofia. The country of 6.4 million people joined the eurozone amid New Year celebrations that blended optimism with anxiety over inflation and political instability, AFP reported.“I warmly welcome Bulgaria to the euro family,” European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde said, describing the euro as a “powerful symbol” of “shared values and collective strength”.For some Bulgarians, the switch was tangible and immediate. “Great! It works!” said Dimitar, a 43-year-old, after withdrawing 100 euros from an ATM shortly after midnight.Successive Bulgarian governments have backed euro adoption, arguing it would strengthen ties with the West, boost the economy of the EU’s poorest member and shield the country from Russian influence. But public opinion has remained split, with many fearing that the transition could push up prices and worsen political uncertainty.President Rumen Radev, speaking shortly before midnight, hailed the move as the “final step” in Bulgaria’s EU integration, even as thousands gathered in sub-zero temperatures in Sofia to mark the New Year. He also expressed regret that Bulgarians had not been consulted through a referendum.“This refusal was one of the dramatic symptoms of the deep divide between the political class and the people, confirmed by mass demonstrations across the country,” Radev said.The euro switch comes at a turbulent political moment. Anti-corruption protests ousted a conservative-led government in mid-December, leaving Bulgaria facing the prospect of its eighth election in five years.“People are afraid that prices will rise, while salaries will remain the same,” a woman in her 40s told AFP in Sofia.At major markets in the capital, prices for goods ranging from groceries to New Year’s Eve items were displayed in both levs and euros. “The whole of Europe has managed with the euro, we’ll manage too,” said Vlad, a retired resident.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Bulgaria’s entry into the eurozone marked “an important milestone”, adding that it would make travel and living abroad easier, improve market transparency and competitiveness, and facilitate trade.Central bank governor Dimitar Radev said the euro represented more than “just a currency — it is a sign of belonging”.However, concerns remain widespread. According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, 49% of Bulgarians oppose the switch. Outgoing prime minister Rossen Jeliazkov sought to reassure citizens and businesses, saying he was “counting on the tolerance and understanding” of the public and insisting that inflation was not linked to euro adoption.Official data show that food prices rose 5% year-on-year in November, more than double the eurozone average. “Unfortunately, prices no longer correspond to those in levs,” pastry shop owner Turgut Ismail, 33, told AFP, saying prices had already begun to rise.Analysts warned that any disruption could be politically sensitive. “Any problems with euro adoption would be seized on by anti-EU politicians,” said Boryana Dimitrova of the Alpha Research polling institute.Some business owners complained of difficulties accessing euros ahead of the switch, while critics questioned the timing. “It’s not the right time,” said Stephane, a 64-year-old economist, citing high debt levels in other eurozone countries.The euro was first introduced in 12 countries in 2002, with Croatia the most recent entrant in 2023. Bulgaria’s accession brings the number of people using the single currency to more than 350 million.","Bulgaria formally gives up the lev, which had been in use since the late 19th century.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

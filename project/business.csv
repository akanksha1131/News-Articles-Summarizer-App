What FM Nirmala Sitharaman said on Income Tax Slabs

“Democracy, Demography and Demand are the key support pillars in our journey towards Viksit Bharat. The middle class provides strength for India’s growth. This Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi has always believed in the admirable energy and ability of the middle class in nation building,” Sitharaman said.

There will be no income tax payable upto income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000.

Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 New versus Old Income Tax Regime: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has given the middle class, common man and salaried taxpayers a big income tax relief bonanza in the Union Budget 2025. With no income tax burden for income levels up to Rs 12.75 lakh, a big section of the middle class has found reason to cheer.All the changes in the income tax slabs and income tax rates for financial year 2025-26 have been brought in the new income tax regime. Hence, the most important question that is there in the minds of salaried income taxpayers is - after Budget 2025 which income tax regime is better for me? Is it time to switch to the new income tax regime or does the old income tax regime with higher tax exemptions and deductions still make sense? TOI answers this important question for you:According to EY, the simple thumb rule that every salaried taxpayer needs to follow is: calculate the total exemptions and deductions that you want to claim in a year under the old income tax regime.Also Read | Union Budget: No income tax up to Rs 12 lakh - a simple guide to what it actually means for taxpayers If the gross income is more than Rs 24.75 lakh, then a salaried individual is better off taking the new income regime only if the deductions and exemptions (Deductions and exemptions which are not allowed under the new tax regime) are less than Rs 8 lakh (excluding standard deduction).It is important to note that this threshold or break-even level of Rs 8 lakh is specific to the 30% tax bracket, that is for income above Rs 24 lakh or Rs 24.75 lakh (including standard deduction). This break-even level will vary for income levels below Rs 24 lakh, as is evident from the table below where specific examples have been given for gross salary levels of Rs 14 lakh, Rs 18 lakh and Rs 22 lakh.Also Check | Income Tax Slabs 2025-26 Budget 2025 Live Updates “The finance minister has proposed reforms to personal taxes with special focus on middle-class tax payers. While there are limited exemptions available under the new tax regime, taxpayers with a gross income exceeding Rs 24.75 lakhs will find the new tax regime beneficial if their total deductions and exemptions, such as those under Section 80C for specified savings, Section 80D for medical insurance, interest on education loan, donations, HRA exemption, and home loan interest under Section 24, which are not available in the new regime, are less than Rs 8,00,000,” explains Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India.“Therefore, when choosing between the old and new tax regimes, it is crucial for taxpayers to carefully compare their deductions and exemptions eligible under the old tax regime with the potential tax savings offered by the lower rates being proposed in the new tax regime,” she says.","New Vs Old Income Tax Regime: Which one should salaried taxpayers opt for post Budget 2025?

Exemptions include House Rent Allowance (""HRA"") exemption, LTA exemption and interest on housing loan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117825985,imgsize-40974,width-400,resizemode-4/117825985.jpg"

Is it better to stay on rent or get your own place? It’s complicated, to borrow a phrase from romantic conundrums. So, should one spend a big sum on a house property – especially with the help of a home loan – given that prices are higher and the capital appreciation in many towns is not as significant as it once was? Isn’t living on rent, perhaps closer to the office, easier? On the other hand, an investment in a house property is a secured and tangible investment. Plus, a house is not just four walls; there is a lot of emotion attached to it. Let’s look at it from the tax perspective…One of the biggest advantages of renting a house from a tax perspective is the exemption for house rent allowance (HRA), a tax-efficient salary component. If HRA is not a part of your salary package — for example if you are self-employed or a consultant— you can avail deduction of up to 5,000 a month from gross taxableincome, under the old tax regime. The HRA exemption is not available to taxpayers who opt for the new tax regime. The exemption is on the lowest of the following:● Rent paid less 10% of salary (basic salary and dearness allowance)● 50% of salary if the house is in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata or Chennai, or 40% of salary in other cities● Actual HRA received● Rent may be lower than a home loan EMI● More choice of location and type● Easy to relocate to another area of city● Tax benefits are available (under old tax regime)● Rent, however high, does not go towards creating an asset● Rents usually increase every year, leading to higher cash outflow● No or limited scope of making structural changes● One may have to vacate on short noticeTax benefits are only available under the old tax regime. If you take a home loan to buy a house property, the EMI is typically made up of two parts: one part goes towards the principal (the amount you took as loan) and the other towards the interest (the cost of servicing the loan).Deduction is available under the overall 1.5 lakh limit under Section 80C under the old tax regime. Principal repayment, stamp duty, registration fee and other expenses related to transfer of the house property qualify for the deduction, under this limit.Three situations apply: the house is self-occupied, vacant or rented out. For a self-occupied house property, there is deduction available on the interest paid on home loan up to 2 lakh per annum under the old tax regime. This can be set off against any other income. The same rules apply even if the house is vacant. If you have rented out the house, you can claim deduction for not only the interest paid on the home loan, but also municipal taxes paid and a standard deduction of 30% of the rental income.If your house is a self-occupied property bought using a home loan, it means you do not earn any rental income from it. Therefore, interest paid on the home loan will result in a loss. Total loss up to 2 lakh from house property (either self-occupied or letout) can be adjusted in a financial year against any other head of income (such as salary or income from other sources). Loss exceeding 2 lakh can be carried forward for eight subsequent assessment years but can be setoff only against ‘Income from house property’.The concept of notional rent applies when an individual owns three houses or more. In such cases, two house properties are considered self-occupied (without any conditions as per the 2025 Budget proposals) and the remaining are treated as ‘deemed let-out’, thus attracting notional rent. This is based on the expected market rent and becomes a taxable income.● A house is an asset and EMIs go towards creating this asset● Substantial tax benefits on home loans● Heavy upfront costs such as down payment and registration, followed by property taxes and repairs● House properties are illiquid as they cannot be sold quickly● Property prices see fluctuations and may not fetch expected returns● EMIs have to be paid regularly, mostly irrespective of situations like loss of income","One of the biggest advantages of renting a house from a tax perspective is the exemption for house rent allowance (HRA), a tax-efficient salary component. If HRA is not a part of your salary package, you can avail deduction of up to 5,000 a month from gross taxableincome.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117857373,imgsize-147566,width-400,resizemode-4/117857373.jpg"
Budget 2025 tightens tax rules for NRIs: What Indian students and professionals abroad must brace for,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/budget-2025-tightens-tax-rules-for-nris-what-indian-students-and-professionals-abroad-must-brace-for/articleshow/117824889.cms,"Indian Students Abroad Face New Tax Scrutiny Under Budget 2025 Changes. (Representative Image)

Tightening NRI Tax Regulations: What Changes?

Greater scrutiny of foreign-earned income: Indian authorities will now have enhanced data-sharing agreements with multiple jurisdictions, especially with countries that are part of India’s Double Tax Avoidance Agreements (DTAA). This means Indian students who take up jobs abroad may need to declare their foreign earnings in India, even if they have no active income sources in the country.

Expanded residency definition for taxation: Previously, NRIs were taxed on their Indian-sourced income only if they spent over 182 days in India within a financial year. However, earlier reforms in Budget 2020 reduced this to 120 days for high-income individuals. Budget 2025 hints at further tightening, making it more difficult for students and professionals to maintain NRI status if they have substantial financial ties to India.

Potential impact on tax treaty benefits: While India maintains DTAA treaties with countries like the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, the government has indicated its intent to rework these agreements to close loopholes exploited for tax avoidance. This could mean increased withholding tax rates on foreign remittances or stricter documentation requirements for those claiming tax relief under DTAA.

What This Means for Students and Professionals Abroad



Increased reporting requirements

Complexity in financial transfers

Higher tax liabilities for returning NRIs

Should Students Worry About This?



The Bottom Line: A More Complicated Financial Future for NRIs



The Union Budget 2025 , while focused on accelerating domestic growth and fiscal consolidation, also signals a more stringent tax regime for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), including students and young professionals abroad. As the government moves to strengthen regulatory oversight and clamp down on tax evasion, individuals with overseas earnings now face tighter scrutiny and expanded reporting requirements. These reforms, positioned as part of India’s broader alignment with international tax norms, introduce new layers of financial complexity for those balancing obligations between their host country and India.Indian students planning to stay abroad post-graduation, whether through work permits, permanent residency, or citizenship, are now facing new challenges following recent changes. Historically, India's tax policies have been relatively lenient for students and young professionals overseas, but the Budget 2025 introduces stricter compliance regulations. While the government's focus on fiscal transparency aligns with global standards, it could impose a substantial reporting burden on young professionals juggling financial obligations across multiple countries.The budget proposes stricter monitoring of income earned abroad by NRIs through amendments in tax treaties and compliance rules. Some of the key changes include:For students who remain in the US, UK, Canada, or Australia on post-study work visas, these regulatory shifts mean higher tax-related obligations and potential double taxation risks if they don’t structure their finances carefully. Some implications include:Indian tax authorities will likely demand detailed disclosures on overseas earnings, investments, and bank accounts. Failing to report these correctly could result in penalties or potential legal action under anti-tax evasion laws.If students or professionals continue sending money to India—for family support, investments, or savings—they might face stricter tax scrutiny. Transactions through the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) may attract compliance checks, particularly for individuals transferring large sums back to Indian accounts.Many students consider returning to India after a few years abroad. However, if their foreign assets (such as savings, stocks, or property investments) are not declared properly, they could be taxed upon repatriation. The Foreign Asset Disclosure Rule under the Black Money Act may also apply, which imposes severe penalties for non-disclosure.While these changes may not immediately impact students, they will become critical for those who transition into long-term residency or citizenship abroad while maintaining financial ties to India. Students seeking permanent residency in countries like Canada and Australia, or H1B sponsorships in the US, must now be more diligent in structuring their tax status.For those who plan to return to India later in their careers, early tax planning—including declaring foreign assets and ensuring proper documentation of earnings—will be crucial to avoid tax disputes.India’s growing scrutiny of offshore income is part of a global push for tax transparency, aligning with initiatives like the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (CRS). While this helps curb tax evasion, it adds layers of compliance for NRIs—including students and young professionals—who must now navigate a tighter regulatory web when managing their earnings abroad.","The Union Budget 2025 signals a more stringent tax regime for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), including students and young professionals abroad.

NEW DELHI: After giving major tax relief to middle class salaried individuals in Union Budget 2025 , finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the significant tax relief provided by the Modi government has put more more money in people's hands compared to the tax structure in 2014 under the previous Congress-led government. The reforms, aimed at putting more money back into taxpayers' hands, have resulted in substantial savings across different income brackets, Sitharaman said.""If you compare what we have done today with what was done in 2014 under the Congress government, the change in rates has also benefited people earning Rs 24 lakh. Now they have Rs 2.6 lakh more than under the old system,"" Sitharaman said.""So, it is not just those earning up to Rs 12 lakh who are benefited, because they do not have to pay any tax due to exemptions,"" the minister added.Adding to this, finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said, ""Earlier, it (rebate) was Rs 2.2 lakh, and in 2014, it became Rs 2.5 lakh; in 2019, it became Rs 5 lakh. Later, it was raised to Rs 7 lakh and now it being raised to Rs 12 lakh. The government feels that on the average Rs 1 lakh per month (income), you need not pay tax.""Speaking on the changes, officials emphasised that middle-class and higher-income earners alike are benefitting from the lower tax rates and increased rebates. The government provided a comparative breakdown:The government stressed that the benefits extend beyond just those earning up to Rs 12 lakh, where tax rebates have been introduced.Even those earning Rs 24 lakh per year will see a reduction in their tax liability, ensuring a more progressive and taxpayer-friendly system.Additionally, the Finance Ministry provided a comparison with the prevailing 2024 tax rates and the newly proposed structure:Finance Secretary emphasised that these tax cuts represent a ""substantial amount being put back into the hands of people who deserve it."" He also noted that not only have rebates been introduced, but the overall tax rates have been lowered, benefiting a broader segment of taxpayers.With these changes, the government has reinforced its commitment to reducing the tax burden, boosting disposable income, and supporting economic growth, ensuring that taxpayers retain a greater share of their earnings.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the significant tax relief provided by the Modi government has put more more money in people's hands.

How will a person who has an income Rs 12 lakh benefit from new rates?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime.

The fiscal deficit for FY25 has been pegged lower at 4.8% of GDP, lower than budgeted 4.9%, while for FY26 the deficit is projected to be 4.4%, lower than what was given in the consolidation road map.""It is very important to be very clear that we (govt) have to remain within a certain fiscal regime.

ICICI Securities has an ‘add’ recommendation on LIC Housing Finance with a target price of Rs 640 (+11%).

After factoring in the weak Oct-Dec performance, analysts cut their FY25 EBITDA estimates by 11%.

They cut ONGC’s consolidated EPS by 19% for FY26E and by 11% for FY27E, due to reduced profitability estimates of subsidiaries and lower international crude oil prices. But they kept their target price unchanged as they ascribed a higher EV/EBITDA for FY27 due to production growth visibility.Centrum Broking has a ‘buy’ recommendation on Nuvama Wealth with a target price of Rs 8,615 (+51%) on the back of robust business outlook.

It was unusually rainy, hot and humid that night in Bacolod City, Philippines. The Bureau of Immigration assembled a crack team of select agents from their Fugitive Search Unit (FSU) to hunt down a high-value suspect. The target was an ""Indian-Nepalese"" national, the subject of a red-corner notice, located by Indian agencies in their country.The subject, Joginder Gyong, 41, was described as a ranking kingpin of a separatist terror group and a wanted criminal in India. He was tipped to be hiding in an apartment in Barangay Tackling locality in Bacolod. The police in Delhi and central agencies identified the alias ""Kanta Gupta"" that Geong was using to stay undercover.Acting on real-time information from their Indian counterparts, the FSU sleuths carried out a clean operation, apprehending their suspect in an ""in-and-out"" sweep.However, this was just the beginning of a tedious process of getting a fugitive back. Delhi Police 's Special Cell, CBI, Intelligence Bureau and Haryana Police followed Geong closely for months. As deportation proceedings began, Geong was detained at BI warden facility in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City, in high security. There was a chance that Khalistan groups could try to free him.It took almost six months for the Indian authorities to get hold of Geong as he was flown in from Manila to Bangkok two days ago and, finally, to India, where he was arrested by Delhi Police's Special Cell early on Sunday.The events started to unfold early in 2024 when Indian agency sleuths shared information with their counterparts in Manila, said a source. The immigration subsequently issued a 'mission order' for Geong's arrest. Geong was heading an organised crime syndicate and was sentenced to life imprisonment in India. After cops got hot on his trail, Geong fled to the Philippines, where he assumed a fake identity and re-established his gang. Interestingly, he fled to South Africa in mid-2000 and was deported in 2007 too.""He is the younger brother of Surender Geong, who died in an exchange of fire with Haryana Police in 2018. Geong spread his tentacles in Karnal, Panipat, Kaithal, Gurgaon and Delhi and was attempting to re-establish a network for extorting money from doctors, contractors, liquor vendors and other financially well-off businessmen,"" said a senior cop.After settling down in the Philippines, he reorganised his gang and started his criminal enterprise and further got fully involved in the terror network of Arsh Dalla, a designated and wanted terrorist of KTF.The Davinder Bambhia gang, currently operated by wanted fugitive Lucky Patial, also came on board, having a fraternal relationship with Kaushal Chaudhary's gang. Soon, Geong rose to be a key planner and organiser of manpower, harbouring fugitives and moving narcotics and weapons as a logistical hub to facilitate the activities of these criminal networks.This network then carried out sensational killings of Youth Akal Dal leader Vicky Midhukhera, Gurlal Brar and Kabaddi player Sandeep Nangal Ambian in recent years. According to police, Geong's criminal history spans 24 cases, with convictions in 15 cases, including five murder cases. A reward of Rs 1.5 lakh was declared on him.Geong's arrest is expected to reveal new information about the terror-criminal nexus, their international connections, and potential links with hostile foreign entities.""The arrest marks a major milestone in the collaboration between Delhi and Haryana Police forces to combat the terrorist-gangster nexus with help from central agencies,"" said Additional Commissioner (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha. A team comprising Inspector Maan Singh and ACP Ved Prakash are interrogating Geong in custody at present.","Joginder Gyong, 41, was described as a ranking kingpin of a separatist terror group.

Through income-tax relief, you appear to betting on rise in consumption. Was that the only consideration?

And spurring consumption could be a byproduct?

The salaried middle classes keep complaining that while they honestly pay taxes, they do not get bang for their buck because they do not get to use public schools or hospitals, there is no unemployment benefit or pension. How do you view this criticism?

How do you see the prospect of growth in the immediate term, given the global uncertainties?

How do you plan to provide relief to those who are outside the ambit of this tax relief. For example, in rural and urban centres?

But there is criticism that quality employment is not being created.

India needs industrial growth as well as agricultural growth, but rural India is witnessing migration and now, we increasingly have only the elderly in villages.

There are worries about inflation.

What about fuel rates?

Is there any possibility of bringing fuel under GST?

Will GST rates be rationalised, particularly of essential commodities?

Will the Centre nudge states towards that end?

Capex will continue from govt side. It's not reduced from last year. On the contrary, it's gone up and private sector can come in any time... (On customs duty) We have been engaged in rationalisation for the past 2 years. We are looking at it item by item. There is no link between the new(Trump) regime coming in and our rationalisation Sitharaman

You were already having to deal with a lot of uncertainties. Now, you have a new factor in the unpredictable US President, Donald Trump. It has been said that the Budget did not factor in the Trump presidency.

What is going to be the mandate for the committee on deregulation that you have talked about?

You have pursued a new IT law since July. Will the changes be limited to simplification of language or go beyond?

In your speech, you hinted at a culture shift, saying the authorities have to first trust the assessee and then only scrutinise. Right now, the presumption, at least in practice, seems to be that you are guilty unless proven innocent. Will the bill shift the onus?

You have reduced customs duty on premium bikes. Is it a signal to the new US administration?

When do you plan to introduce the insurance bill?

You have followed the path of fiscal consolidation. Do we have the firepower in case the global situation turns adverse?

There is concern about the shrinking tax base which has further shrunk after the latest concessions. How do you see that? It is said the narrow tax base will lead to a longterm problem.

The finance ministry had very strong views on Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs). You have now signalled a revamp. What is the intent behind this?

An election is always due somewhere. But Purvodaya is part of the PM's larger plan for the eastern region. He is very keen on it. Bihar deserves help. A state with such dense population needs several things so that it can catch up Sitharaman

The focus on Bihar has been linked to elections which are due in Nov. So, was it the only consideration?

The govt has been fiscally prudent. When you spoke to the PM on the tax relief issue, what was his response

You have announced an asset monetisation plan. How will that proceed?

Will it cover the pending ones like

Hotel Ashok

, Stadia?

What about the choice of a sari with Madhubani art on Budget day?

The main consideration was that we should honour taxpayers, honest taxpayers who have been contributing to nation building.It can be. It can boost savings too.I also wish public services moved commensurately, but they are not just in the central govt’s hands. They are also in the local bodies’ hands, and in the state govt’s hands. There are elected representatives in all these places. They are all not run by the central govt. But I do sincerely wish that they improved for the sake of people.The World Bank and the IMF have clearly indicated that India will continue to be the fastest growing economy and despite all the odds and challenges resulting from extraneous reasons, we still have a very buoyant, strong economy. Our macroeconomic fundamentals are very strong. So, our growth will continue.We have several schemes to provide them relief such as Kisan Credit Card, whose limit has been raised from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. Another Rs 50 crore will be brought in the ambit of the revamped Stand-Up India loans. Banks are giving record number of loans at discounted rates for affordable housing, while start-ups are getting another Rs 10,000 crore through the Fund of Funds. More than 2 lakh start-ups had registered for the hand-holding assistance in 2016. So, each sector has got affordable credit. At the grassroots, SHGs are getting a corpus for doing business.We will continue with our public sector expenditure. Capex will continue from govt side. It's not reduced from last year. On the contrary, it's gone up and private sector can come in any time.It is a commercial decision, which industries have to take as to when they want to get into the market to expand their capacity or build new capacities. So, beyond this, I may not be in a position to answer.Is true that after corporate tax rate was brought down in 2019, a lot of cleaning up of the books has happened. The twin balance sheet problem between companies and banks has been addressed. So, the companies are, I'm told, making profits but probably keeping it as passive investments, earning interest on the money but yet not feeling that at this time, it is adequate or proper for them to invest and expand capacities. So, they may take a call depending on how demand and export possibilities arise. It's also true that globally, exports are facing challenges and they want the pace of growth of exports to pick up a lot more, even that would be part of their considerations for taking the call.That's the point which the chief economic advisor has made.Privatisation will happen at least for those for which have been cleared by the cabinet. It’s quite a long list. We'll have to keep those units running profitably, professionally, to ensure they are vibrant units. We cannot neglect them just because they were put on the disinvestment list. We have been taking steps and that’s why many of the companies have now got good valuations; whether they are listed or not, at least they are being run professionally. Just as disinvestment is my responsibility, I am also responsible for keeping them in robust health. That’s what we are doing.The July Budget came up with five different schemes, four of which looked at employment generation in MSMEs and also in large corporations for which the govt scheme would come and support in terms of EPFO registration and so on. Of the five schemes, one was aimed at giving internship opportunities in top 500 companies. The pilot run of Phase 1 is over, the second pilot has begun; and so, the internship scheme is moving and students and young adults from very distant areas are benefitting without having to move out of their district. They are being placed with companies in their own districts. There are some who, by choice, want to go to Bengaluru or to Haryana, to Gurgaon or any other place. And have located them as well. They are all going through their internship. Besides that, Rozgar Melas are filling up all the vacant positions in the govt. In this Budget, which I've given for the leather industry, toy sector, for textiles, for critical minerals, for lithium ion batteries, I have already made enough number of announcements which are all labour intensive.Companies are in search of skilled workers. They tell me I want these many people with such skill sets. Job positions are available. The issue also is how many youth are available with required skill sets? Expectations are not being fulfilled because of this mismatch. Companies are not able to get such workers and those who have the skill sets are not able to reach the companies. We are trying to find a way to provide some exposure. We are working on this. Actually, this internship scheme is also about telling people what kind of jobs are available.Agricultural growth has been steady all over the country. Even during Covid, agriculture contributed significantly to India's GDP. In this Budget, we have provided two schemes for promoting rural livelihood and prosperity. The PM Dhan Dhanya Krishi Yojana has so many components that it should ensure that migration becomes an option rather than a compulsion. If you are getting an opportunity, there is no need for them to go out. If we create lots of opportunities, as the PM Dhan Dhanya Krishi Yojana intends to do, in rural districts with low productivity, by using high yielding and hybrid seeds, then they will find jobs there itself. They can be helped also by better handholding for marketing, and by value addition for those products.Inflation is not going up, it’s coming down. The data is released every month. Inflation is something which both the Reserve Bank of India and the Govt of India continuously monitor and try to bring down. Prices of products go up because of input costs and it is something which affects the entire buyer and seller market. But govt takes supply side measures to ensure adequate availability of goods, even perishable ones.State govts play a role. The data on inflation in states clearly shows those states which have not cut fuel prices are the ones who are suffering from higher inflation.GST Council turned down the suggestion. We suggested that at least aviation turbine fuel can be brought under GST and petrol and diesel remain outside, but state finance ministers did not agree. So, the question should be put to the state finance ministers, not to me.There is a discussion going on in the GST Council. We will let you know once they take the call.Centre is part of the GST Council and our inputs go into the eventual decision... meaning we'll discuss. The Centre's viewpoint will also go into it.You answered the question yourself. We will not get to know what the US administration or, for that matter, any other administration in the world is going to do about India unless they take a call. So, what exactly should I prepare for? We can only be mindful of and watchful about it. But what action can I take when there is no announcement about anything concerning India?Well, the details will be worked out, but they include items like, when licences have to be given or inspections are to be conducted or a certificate has to be issued for a product of a certain standard. Currently, there is lack of clarity. The industry or the manufacturers are asked one thing at one point in time, and quite another at some other point. The overall sense is that there is not a common approach; no SOP even if there is one. Manufacturers too have concerns about regulators. So, should there be a way to approach a problem from a manufacturer's point of view, from a trader’s point of view. So that we can go beyond merely saying ‘oh no, here is my rule and you have to follow’. Else, you are not going to get the licence. Another fellow says that I have to inspect you. And there is yet another who says I have to visit you each month. Such things are completely avoidable. So we want to bring some coherence in the way this is handled.It will be a comprehensive approach to making the Income Tax Act relevant to the 21st century; relevant to an era which is technology-driven; relevant to times where the taxpayer is most often doing the assessment and filing himself. So, for a citizen to be able to deal with income tax on his own, the system should be simple enough for him to handle. It is also something we are working on because of the looseness and ambiguity of language. There are also several issues in courts where both sides appear to be right. That is because of the language used in the Act. And why should it be like that? The Act came in 1965 and India has since seen major changes; in 1991, the economy opened up, liberalization came in. Then, in 2020, Covid struck. So many changes have happened, and there have only been additions to the Act in response. Are they all consistent? Are the additions aligned with the original intent of the law? All of this has necessitated a comprehensive relook.Even now, when it comes to the question of this Budget proposal on the people who have more than one residence or one house, we have said that selfdeclaration, whether one is being used for personal purpose or whether one has been rented out is fine with us. It is for the tax assessee to say what he wants to say, and for us his word is final. That is already on.Trust is what we want and, therefore, trust is what we are trying to use as a first step. Self-declaration, yes, trust is the first thing.We have been engaged in rationalisation of customs duty for the past two years We are looking at it item by item. There is no link between the new regime coming in and our work on rationalisation.We will let you know once we have something on this. At the moment, I have said that we will be bringing the income tax bill this week.Our fundamentals are strong even now. So my fiscal deficit is continuously assessed. The deficit number is given in the glide path and that is what I am following. Not one single year have I failed. And that would not be possible if my fundamentals were not strong.So, is it wiser to keep loading the narrow base with taxes because that is the only set of people I have for paying taxes? Even that's not right. Therefore, we have said that we need to give relief. We will give relief because that's honouring the taxpayer and he has been contributing all the while. But it is also equally upon us to widen the tax base and keep newer people coming in who have not been earlier paying taxes, who are probably in the tax payable net. So, we will draw them in.We want to have the draft BIT to be a bit more investor friendly. That’s why I want to do it.In the July Budget too, we announced schemes for Bihar when elections were not on the horizon. An election is always due somewhere. But Purvodaya is part of the PM's larger plan for the eastern region. He is very keen on it. That is why we revived fertiliser plants in the region. Bihar deserves help. A state with such dense population needs several things so that it can catch up. Bihar is part of the Buddhist tourism circuit but lacks a big international airport. Is giving it one greenfield airport an excess? I am surprised by the criticism. I don't think we need an opposition which is opposed to the progress of such a state. They should say openly that they are against Bihar's development. Don't do anything for Bihar because we don't want you to develop Bihar, is this what they are trying to say? The PM has repeatedly said that a state needs to improve irrespective of the party in office. Else, it will become a drag and pull you down. So, I'm happy we are doing this.Right from the beginning, his guidance was to find out how you would be able do it , what is going to be the formulation and, so, we worked with the department of revenue, CBDT and only then went with the proposal. Various different.The first plan went well and we are bringing the second edition and under that we will plough back about Rs 10 lakh crore under that and I have mentioned this in the budget speech. We will take it forward.I wouldn't name individual items but yes it will cover a whole lot of sectors.This is a very interesting story. I had gone to Madhubani in Nov when I was introduced to Dulari Devi, who is known for her paintings. She belongs to the fishing community, an EBC, and she gave this sari to me and told me to wear it on Budget day. I offered to pay but she would not let me. She said it is our custom to give sari and other gifts when a daughter visits home. On Budget day, I remembered her and so....",FM Sitharaman explains the macroeconomic context of her Budget. She rejects the criticism that the concessions would further shrink the tax base. She asserts that strong fundamentals would help the economy weather global uncertainties. She says the focus on Bihar has been linked to elections which are due in Nov.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117874938,imgsize-696280,width-400,resizemode-4/117874938.jpg"

Trump’s crypto policies



Cryptocurrency prices fell after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. Bitcoin dropped from around $105,000 on Saturday to about $92,000 on Sunday night. However, it later recovered to over $100,000 on Monday after Trump paused tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods.While bitcoin showed some recovery, other cryptocurrencies saw larger losses. Ethereum , dogecoin, and other digital assets declined sharply. Trump’s own meme coin traded at around $19 on Monday, about 75 per cent below its peak when he launched it before his second inauguration.“These are riskier cryptos than bitcoin,” Garrick Hileman, a cryptocurrency analyst was quoted as saying by news agency Associated. “But it’s a little surprising how big the gap is.”Financial markets also saw major shifts before the tariffs were set to take effect. Trump warned that Americans might feel “some pain” from the tariffs but said the move was necessary. He also suggested that tariffs on the European Union and possibly the United Kingdom could follow.Bitcoin was created in 2009 as digital cash outside government control. Over the years, it has become more mainstream, with its price movements now closely tied to tech stocks.Meme coins, a more volatile part of the crypto market, have also seen sharp declines. First Lady Melania Trump’s meme coin, launched before Trump took office, is down nearly 90% from its highest value.Trump, who was once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, has now embraced digital assets. He has promised to make the US a leader in crypto and has appointed officials supportive of the industry.Despite recent declines, cryptocurrencies have gained value since Trump’s election. Bitcoin remains close to its record high of $109,000.","Cryptocurrency prices fell after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.

Asian stocks took a hit overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei tumbling 2.8 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng down 1 per cent.However, mainland Chinese markets remain closed until Wednesday due to the Lunar New Year holiday.European markets are bracing for further declines as investors assess the risk of a global trade war . The pound slipped 1 per cent against a stronger US dollar, trading just under $1.23, though it gained 0.4 per cent against the euro, which is also weighed down by the tariff war.Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, told The Mirror, financial markets are likely to react strongly to Trump’s tariff measures.

Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and ether witnessed steep declines on Monday as rising tariff war tensions weakened investor sentiments. During early trade in Asia, Bitcoin fell to $94,476.18, briefly hitting a three-week low of $91,441.89.Ether saw an even steeper drop of 24 per cent, hitting its lowest level since September, to $2,494.33.The downturn extended into Sunday, with bitcoin slipping 7 per cent to $93,768.66, according to Coin Metrics. The CoinDesk 20 index, which tracks the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation, dropped 19 per cent.The selloff follows US President Donald Trump’s announcements of a a 25 per cent levy on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, set to take effect on Tuesday. Given that the US conducts around $1.6 trillion in annual trade with these three nations, the move has heightened fears of an economic slowdown.In retaliation to the levies, Canada and Mexico vowed to impose countermeasures, while China signalled plans to challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organisation.""Crypto is really the only way to express risk over the weekend, and on news like this, crypto resorts to a risk proxy,"" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, told CNBC. The market volatility is expected to weaken economic growth, affect corporate earnings and drive inflation higher.Following Trump's victory in elections, Bitcoin had surged 40 per cent, reaching an all-time high of $107,071.86 on January 20, the day of his inauguration as the 47th US President. Much of this rally was driven by expectations that his administration would introduce crypto-friendly policies, with Trump himself vowing to make the US the ""crypto capital of the planet.""However, despite early optimism, some investors have grown impatient over the lack of concrete regulatory reforms. Last month, Trump ordered the formation of a cryptocurrency working group to explore potential regulations and even consider a national crypto reserve, but rigid policy changes remain absent.Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, believes the ongoing tariff war could ultimately benefit bitcoin in the long run. ""“A sustained tariff war will be amazing for bitcoin in the long run due to an eventual weakening of the dollar and US rates."" he told ET.Analysts are keeping a close eye on the $90,000 support level for bitcoin, warning that a drop below this threshold could trigger a slide towards $80,000.

Further lookout for trade war

US President Donald Trump’s latest trade war proved to be a major blow for Canada, Mexico and China, pushing their currencies to multi-year lows.The greenback recorded a major gain while weighing down Euro to a two year low and injuring the conventional safe haven Swiss frank to its lowest since May.However, two biggest trading partners for the States’ Canada and Mexico, wasted no time in vowing retaliation measures. China also condemned the move, claiming it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization, news agency Reuters reported.Last month after assuming office, Trump had threatened to hit Canada and Mexico with a 25 per cent tariff and while China stood at a levy of 10 per cent, alleging to combat issues like illegal immigration and drug trade.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, gained 0.11 per cent to 109.65 after hitting a three-week high previously in the session.The tariff news also shifted expectations for Federal Reserve policy .

NEW DELHI: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday announced that Canada would impose 25% tariffs on $106 billion worth US imports in a retaliatory move against Donald Trump. This came moments after the latter signed the executive order imposing steep tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, escalating tensions in an emerging trade war.""Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25% tariffs against Can$155 billion ($106 billion) worth of American goods,"" he saidHe urged the Canadians to prevent vacationing in US to fight back over the tariff imposition.Further, Trudeau announced that retaliatory duties on $30 billion worth of US alcohol and fruit will take effect Tuesday, coinciding with the implementation of US tariffs. He began his address with a direct message to American consumers.“It will have real consequences for you, the American people,” he said.“The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together,” Trudeau said, warning that it could bring about “dark times"" for many.Trump declared an economic emergency to impose tariffs of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada. However, energy imports from Canada—including oil, natural gas, and electricity—would be subject to a reduced 10% tariff.""Today, I have implemented a 25% Tariff on Imports from Mexico and Canada (10% on Canadian Energy), and a 10% additional Tariff on China.

I made a promise on my Campaign to stop the flood of illegal aliens and drugs from pouring across our Borders, and Americans overwhelmingly voted in favor of it,"" Trump said in a post on social media.Trump has argued that the government should rely more on tariff revenue, as it did before the introduction of the income tax in 1913.

He drew attention to the project’s standout features and why they could be a game-changer. Best Wallet is setting a new standard in crypto management.The Solana blockchain is popular, yes. But it is facing growing pains as its popularity soars. High demand has led to network congestion, delayed transactions, and increased fees.Solaxy is bringing the first Layer-2 solution to Solana. It takes a creative route to improve the blockchain’s performance. The platform uses roll-up technology to act as an off-ramp for Solana’s mainnet. The transactions are processed on a secondary chain, bundled together, and sent back for confirmation. Here is how it helps:The Solaxy ecosystem revolves around its native token, $SOLX.

South Korean electronics giant Samsung reported a staggering 129.85 per cent year-on-year surge for the fourth quarter ending in December.It registered a growth of 6.5 trillion won, in its operating profits on Friday, against 2.82 trillion won, over the corresponding period last year.However, this growth in the fourth quarter was still low from its previous quarter for 2024 which stood at 9.18 trillion won, amid struggles in fulfilling demand for chips used in artificial intelligence servers.This announcement follows the company’s announcement in October, when it admitted going through a “crisis” and concerns were raised about its ""fundamental technological competitiveness and the future of the company"".The company recorded a net income growth of 22.2 per cent from the previous year at 7.75 trillion won.Sales also followed an upward momentum with a 11.8 percent growth at 75.78 trillion won.AFP reported that the company's net profit was higher than expected, according to Yonhap News Agency, which cited its own financial data firm.Samsung, the family-controlled conglomerates that dominate Asia's fourth-largest economy, said that the dip in profits from the previous quarter was due to ""soft market conditions especially for IT products, and an increase in expenditures including R&D.""""In the first quarter of 2025... overall earnings improvement may be limited due to weakness in the semiconductors business,"" it added.It has also been facing tough competition from its Korean rival SK hynix, which is US tech giant Nvidia’s main supplier of high-bandwidth memory (HBM).Samsung has been falling short of meeting Nvidia's requirements.Gloria Tsuen, a Moody's Ratings vice president and senior credit officer toldd AFP that Samsung’s technology leadership ""in the semiconductor market has been eroded over the last few years.""""The rapidly increasing demand for AI chips also heightens the technological difficulty in developing new, custom-made chips for customers in a timely manner,"" she added.","South Korean electronics giant Samsung reported a staggering 129.85 per cent year-on-year surge for the fourth quarter ending in December.

Inflation pressures persist



Donald Trump inherits a healthy economy



Global comparison



The US economy wrapped up 2024 on a solid note, with consumer spending and government support playing key roles in driving growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department.Despite some challenges, the economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected. For the full year, GDP grew by 2.8%, a strong performance, although slightly down from the 2.9% growth in 2023.Consumer spending rose by 4.2% in the final quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since early 2023. This growth was up from 3.7% in the previous quarter. The economy also benefitted from government spending and continued investment, although business investment slowed, particularly in equipment spending, which fell sharply after two strong quarters.Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, said, ""Consumers have been the foundation of the economy, and they've been the biggest driver of resilient growth in 2024,"" as quoted by the AFP news agency. He believes this growth will continue, supported by low layoffs, healthy job growth, and rising wages.The report also showed ongoing inflation. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, increased by 2.5%, slightly up from 2.2% in the previous quarter.Despite these inflation pressures, the economy remained strong. A key part of GDP, which excludes volatile items like exports and inventories, grew by 3.2% in the third quarter, down from 3.4% in the previous quarter.President Donald Trump, who took office in January 2025, inherited a strong economy, with growth continuing despite high interest rates. Unemployment was 4.1% in December, and job gains stayed steady. The Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged in December, after cutting it three times since September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell was quoted as saying to the Associated Press, “We do not need to be in a hurry to make more cuts,” due to the economy’s strength.The US economy is growing strongly, while Europe is struggling, having seen zero growth at the end of last year. The European Central Bank recently lowered its benchmark rate due to weak performance. In the US, strong consumer spending, low unemployment, and rising wages have helped maintain growth, despite ongoing inflation concerns.Trump has promised to cut taxes and reduce business regulations, but his plans on tariffs and immigration might slow growth and raise prices. KPMG's chief economist, Diane Swonk, pointed out that the effects of these policies will take time. While some analysts expect growth to slow in 2025, they still believe the US economy will remain strong for now.","US economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected.

Tesla results miss estimates as company projects 2025 auto volume growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-results-miss-estimates-as-company-projects-2025-auto-volume-growth/articleshow/117716151.cms,"Full autonomy soon?

Tesla reported lower than expected profits Wednesday but confirmed key 2025 benchmarks, saying it will return to sales volume growth and move forward with fully autonomous driving.The results -- the first since the return of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ally Donald Trump to the White House -- capped a mixed year for Tesla in which Musk's big bet on US electoral politics was countered by profit pressures as Tesla's streak of annual car volume growth came to an end.The electric car company reported fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter, where profits were boosted by a one-time tax benefit.Revenues rose two percent to $25.7 billion, also missing analyst estimates, but reflecting a more than doubling of sales in energy generation and storage.Musk has sought to temper expectations about Tesla's near-term financial growth, while employing superlatives in touting Tesla's autonomous driving and robotic ventures, saying they could make Tesla ""the most valuable company in the world by far,"" worth more than the ""next five companies combined.""Musk, who spent some $270 million or more to help Trump win the White House, largely steered clear of political subjects during the 65-minute conference call.The company has been confronted by intensifying EV competition in leading markets, including China and the United States, where General Motors and Ford have introduced more models.Another factor has been lower sales than expected from the Cybertruck, Musk's futuristic auto giant that has won cheers from Tesla fans and jeers from critics.But Tesla expects growth in 2025, saying in its earnings release that ""with the advancements in vehicle autonomy and the introduction of new products, we expect the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025.""The company confirmed plans to unveil new, more affordable vehicles in 2025 and said its launch of a new robotaxi venture in parts of the United States was on track to begin this year.Tesla named its driver-assistance programs ""autopilot"" and ""full self-driving"" (FSD), even though the programs require the driver to maintain attention, while rival robotaxi venture Waymo has achieved full driverless functionality in three US cities so far.Musk has repeatedly missed earlier targets towards full autonomy, quipping during Wednesday that he was like the boy who cried wolf.""But I'm telling you, there's a damn wolf this time, and you can drive it,"" Musk said.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

According to Bajaj Broking Research, Kiri Industries and HFCL are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for May 16, 2025:

Index View: Nifty

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in the broad range of 56,000-53,000 in the last 15 sessions.

Key observation is that the index has taken 15 sessions to retrace just 38.2% of the prior 9-session rally (49,157–56,098), indicating a shallow pullback that suggests underlying strength and potential higher bottom formation

The overall Bank Nifty structure is positive and dips should be used as a buying opportunity. We expect the index to head towards 56,400 levels in the short term, being the 123.6% external retracement of the recent breather (56194-53585).

The daily stochastic remains in uptrend sustaining above its nine periods average highlighting strength and supports positive bias. Key support for the short-term point of view is placed at 54,500- 54,000 being the confluence of the Monday’s gap area and 20-day EMA.

Indian markets witnessed a strong up move during the current week with benchmark indices gaining more than 4% in the last 4 sessions. Key factors driving the Monday’s rally included: (A) A ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, (B) Renewed optimism around the US-China trade deal, (C) An early forecast for the southwest monsoon, expected to arrive in Kerala by May 27, earlier than the usual June 1 onset, (D) News of upcoming Russia-Ukraine peace talks scheduled for May 15.Market started the week on a strong note and generated a breakout above 12-sessions consolidation range (24,589–23,848), indicating resumption of up move. The Index witnessed some profit booking on Tuesday around the phycological levels of 25,000 and gave up some of its gains to test the breakout area of 24,500 on Wednesday. Nifty, however, resumed its up move on the weekly expiry session and formed a fresh weekly high of 25,116 on Thursday session.We expect the index to maintain overall positive bias with immediate hurdle placed around 25,200-25,300 levels being the 78.6% retracement of the entire decline (26,277-21,744) and the measuring implication of the recent range breakout.A sustained breakout above the 25,300 levels will open further upside towards 25,750 in the coming weeks. The recent breakout area of 24,500-24,400 is likely to act as key support going forward which also coincides with the recent breakout area and key retracement area.The stock is currently at the cusp of generating a breakout above the last 4 months triangular consolidation pattern signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock is sustaining above the 50- and 200-days EMA and the base of the recent consolidation is placed at the 200 days signaling strength and positive bias.The 14 periods RSI in the daily chart is seen sustaining above its nine periods average thus validates positive bias in the stock. We expect the stock to head higher towards 730 levels in the medium term being the 123.6% external retracement of the recent breather (699-484).The stock is currently trading significantly above its short-term and medium-term exponential moving averages (21-EMA and 50-EMA), which are positioned at ₹81 and ₹83 respectively—signaling underlying strength.Following a brief phase of consolidation, the counter has validated a double bottom breakout on the daily chart, projecting an upside potential towards ₹105 (~17%).Additionally, a breakout above the descending trendline resistance further corroborates the bullish trend reversal, suggesting renewed momentum and a shift in market structure.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Kiri Industries and HFCL are the top stock picks for today.

Gold and silver price prediction : Gold prices have dipped sharply in the last few days while silver price s are showing strength. Even as some geopolitical tensions around the world weigh, there are signs of the dollar gaining favour. In such a scenario, what is the outlook for gold and silver prices? Should you buy or sell gold, and what are the gold and silver price levels you should watch out for?Gold prices witnessed a sharp 5% decline last week, bringing the precious metal down to a critical support level near ₹92,000. This level holds significant technical importance, and as long as it remains unbroken, there is a potential for a rebound.If the support holds, a retracement is likely, targeting at least the 50% Fibonacci level of the recent fall from ₹97,500 to ₹92,400. This places the retracement target around ₹95,000 followed by 61.8% retracement which comes to ₹95,500. Such a move would be considered a technical pullback, potentially offering short-term buying opportunities.However, the situation remains fragile. A decisive break below ₹92,000 could negate the possibility of recovery and open the door to further downside momentum. In that case, increased selling pressure could drive gold prices lower, possibly testing the ₹90,000 mark in the coming sessions.Traders should closely monitor price action around this support zone, as it will likely dictate the short-term trend. While fundamentals such as inflation concerns or geopolitical tensions can influence gold, technical levels like these often act as key decision points for market participants.Overall, ₹92,000 is a make-or-break level for gold, and the market’s behaviour around this point will be crucial in determining its next move.Silver prices have been exhibiting a positive formation in recent weeks, indicating underlying strength in the trend. However, during the last week, the metal entered a consolidation phase, trading within a narrow range with key resistance at ₹97,500 and support at ₹95,300.This range-bound movement reflects a temporary pause in momentum as the market awaits a breakout in either direction. A decisive move above the ₹97,500 resistance level could trigger a fresh wave of buying interest, paving the way for a rally towards the psychologically significant ₹1,00,000 mark.Sustained strength beyond that could further extend gains toward ₹1,05,000 in the near term, reinforcing the bullish outlook. On the other hand, if silver fails to break above resistance and instead slips below the ₹95,300 support level, it may attract renewed selling pressure. In such a scenario, prices could decline sharply and potentially revisit the ₹92,000 zone, where buyers might look to re-enter.Therefore, the current price band between ₹95,300 and ₹97,500 acts as a critical decision-making zone. Traders should remain alert and wait for a clear breakout or breakdown before initiating fresh positions. The direction of the next significant move in silver will largely depend on how prices behave around these levels.","Gold prices witnessed a sharp 5% decline last week, bringing the precious metal down to a critical support level near ₹92,000.

Not just Pakistan! Bangladesh to get $1.3 billion from IMF; seeks $762 million augmentation in support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/not-just-pakistan-now-bangladesh-seeks-762-million-additional-aid-from-imf/articleshow/121179530.cms,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) confirmed on Wednesday that Bangladesh requested the entity for an additional financial support of $762 million, as the country grapples with mounting macroeconomic challenges. This request, if granted, would bring the total IMF assistance to Bangladesh to approximately $4.1 billion under a mix of credit and sustainability programmes.""Amid significant macroeconomic challenges, the authorities requested an augmentation of SDR ( Special Drawing Rights ) 567.2 million (approximately $762 million) in IMF financial support to Bangladesh under the ECF and EFF arrangements,"" said Chris Papageorgiou, IMF mission chief for Bangladesh, quoted by PTI.The IMF plans to disburse $1.3 billion to Bangladesh in June after completing its fourth assessment of the $4.7 billion lending programme.IMF and Bangladeshi authorities reached a staff-level agreement to complete the combined third and fourth reviews under the extended credit facility (ECF), extended fund facility (EFF), and resilience and sustainability facility (RSF). The agreement still awaits approval from the IMF Executive Board, and is contingent on critical prior actions such as full exchange rate liberalisation and tax reforms.If approved, the completion of the reviews would unlock SDR 983.8 million (around $1.3 billion), comprising SDR 650.5 million ($874 million) from the ECF and EFF, and SDR 333.3 million ($448 million) from the RSF.Explaining the reason behind the aid, the IMF said that the Bangladeshi economy is under considerable strain, as its GDP growth slowed to 3.3 per cent year-on-year in the first half of the 2024-25 fiscal year. While a modest rebound to 3.8 per cent is projected for the full year, pressures remain high due to external financing needs and domestic instability.Inflation, which approached double digits earlier in the fiscal year, is now expected to fall to around 8.5% by the end of the year. However, the IMF warned that risks remain tilted to the downside, citing issues within the banking sector and ongoing global uncertainty.To address the challenges, the IMF has urged tighter near-term policy measures, alongside longer-term structural reforms. These include strengthening governance, improving transparency, and enhancing the business climate to attract foreign investment and diversify exports beyond the ready-made garment sector.“Institutional reforms to bolster the independence and governance of Bangladesh Bank will be essential for ensuring long-term macroeconomic and financial stability and for the effective implementation of broader financial sector reforms,” IMF said.","Bangladesh has asked the International Monetary Fund for an additional financial support of $762 million.

US-China Tariff Truce Impact

NEW DELHI: With the US and China agreeing to a tariff truce, Apple is reviewing its aggressive plans to scale up in India. While the “regular expansion and China+1 production diversification plans will continue as envisaged”, sources said the iPhone strategy being drawn up exclusively for the US market will be “temporarily put under review”.“We await clarity on the geopolitical situation and the tariffs. Things have been moving at a fast pace, and there have been many sudden changes to the US govt’s stance on tariffs, including with regards to China where duty has been reduced drastically over the past few days. We will take a breather before embarking on any mega production expansion plans in India with regards to exclusive supplies to the US,” a source told TOI.he move comes as Trump — during his current Doha visit — said that he has asked Tim Cook not to source iPhones from India when it comes to meeting the needs of the US market. Trump’s stiff stance against outsourcing comes after Apple’s assurance to the US govt that it will invest $500 billion in America over the next four years, including for setting up a new advanced manufacturing facility in Houston to produce servers. The company said that it will add an additional 20,000 hires in the US by 2029.Rattled by Trump’s tariffs, Cook had recently announced India as the mainstay for iPhone supplies to the US. “For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,” Cook had said in response to a question at the company’s quarterly earnings call on May 2.Following Trump’s latest statement, Indian govt sources said that Apple has assured them about maintaining its investment plans in India through manufacturing partners Foxconn and the Tata group. “Apple has said that there will be ‘no let up’ in the regular investment plans that began in the post-Covid period after the introduction of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for smartphones. The China+1 diversification will continue. Only the exclusive US supplies are under review.”A senior govt official told reporters that companies decide on their production facilities based on multiple factors, including revenue, productivity and competitiveness, and these are commercial decisions.","With US and China agreeing to a tariff truce, Apple is reviewing its aggressive plans to scale up in India.

Mumbai: The Centre appointed Dinesh Pant and Ratnakar Patnaik as managing directors of Life Insurance Corporation of India, effective from 1 June 2025, according to stock exchange filings made by the insurer on 14 May. The appointments come ahead of two scheduled retirements at the MD level and signal continuity at the helm of the state-owned life insurer.Pant, who is LIC’s appointed actuary and executive director (actuarial), will serve as managing director until his superannuation on 31 May 2027, or until further orders, whichever is earlier. Patnaik, the corporation’s chief investment officer and executive director (investment–front office), will hold the MD role until 31 March 2028, the date of his superannuation.The appointments come amid an expected reshuffle in LIC’s senior leadership. Two of the four existing MDs—M Jagannath and Tablesh Pandey—are due to retire on 31 May 2025. Siddhartha Mohanty, the current CEO and MD, is also set to complete his term on 7 June.LIC, which was listed on Indian stock exchanges in 2022, continues to operate under close oversight from the govt, which remains its majority shareholder. Leadership changes in LIC are processed through a formal selection mechanism led by the Financial Services Department and approved through official notification.Both Pant and Patnaik have held key roles within LIC. Pant served in actuarial functions critical to product pricing and risk assessment, while Patnaik oversaw LIC’s investment strategy, a crucial portfolio given the insurer’s significant exposure to equity and debt markets.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a buy recommendation on Page Industries with the target price at Rs 57,500. Analysts said that the company showed strong volume growth with robust margin expansion during the Jan-March quarter. Analysts also model an EBIDTA margin guidance at the higher end of the 19%-21% range for FY26. They feel there is still upside risk due to strong gross margin recovery. In addition, they also feel the company’s initiations towards inventory optimization through the ARS system, new product launches, capacity expansion, and digitization initiatives will support growth.BNP Paribas has an outperform rating for Bharti Airtel with the target price at Rs 2,000. Analysts said Airtel reported strong numbers for the Jan-March period with its India mobile revenue, EBITDA and operating cash flow growing strongly. Results were largely in-line, excluding favourable exceptionals. Airtel doubled its dividend y-y, and with strong cash generation ahead, we see scope for further increases. While overall capex is set to decline, Airtel is looking to invest in high-growth areas such as home broadband, enterprise and digital while reducing subsidies in the low-growth DTH business.Elara Securities India has a buy rating on REC with the target price at Rs 650, but has reduced EPS estimates. Analysts said this was on the back of lower growth during recent months. They said REC’s growth run-rate has slowed on a high asset base and recoveries. Healthy NIMs continue to aid earnings. The company is now a steady compounder with long-term growth.ICICI Securities has an add rating on Akzo Nobel with the target price at Rs 3,700. Analysts feel Akzo Nobel’s premium/luxury positioning drove market share gain for the third year running. While the paint industry contracted in FY25 and Birla Opus also grabbed a low-mid single market share in FY25, Akzo performed well with market share gains in all four quarters of FY25. Akzo has done healthy investments in product differentiation and distribution but they believe the chief reason for market share gain is premium/ luxury positioning. In their view, the price conscious consumers are likely to be swayed away by new brands offering higher trade discounts/schemes. They also believe Akzo Nobel is in a better position to maintain its margins compared to its peers.Emkay Global Financial Services has an add rating on Jubilant Foodworks with the target price at Rs 775. Analysts said the company’s Jan-March performance was in-line with their estimates. The company continued to outperform in the Jan-march quarter too, helped by company-specific initiatives in terms of free/faster deliveries, new innovations and organizational restructuring, as broader demand remains weak. With launch of Big-Big-Pizza and anniversarization of delivery waiver, bill size has reverted to growth in the current quarter and should help deliver mid-teens growth in FY26.","Bharti Airtel reported strong numbers for the Jan-March period with its India mobile revenue, EBITDA and operating cash flow growing strongly.

NEW DELHI: India’s C-suite gender gap is stark, highlighting a significant disparity in leadership roles, with women holding just 17% of C-suite roles and 20% of board positions at India Inc. What’s more concerning is the low recruitment of women into entry-level private sector jobs, said McKinsey’s ‘ Women in the Workplace ’ report focused on India.Though women represent nearly half of the enrolled university students, they hold just one in three entry-level roles and 24% of manager-level positions, the survey of 77 domestic companies said.Vivek Pandit, senior partner, McKinsey & Company, told TOI, “India’s starting point on women’s workforce participation is stronger than many assume, 33% at entry level compared to 48% in North America. And while North America made real strides at the top, nearly doubling C-suite representation over the past decade, India has the potential to follow that path. But progress isn’t automatic.”The imbalance in India is further highlighted by a seven-year age gap at the entry level, where women average 39 years compared to men at 32, the widest gap across three countries, India, Kenya, and Nigeria. This suggests that many women start formal employment later or stagnate.Entry-level men are over twice as likely to be promoted to managerial roles than women, while entry-level women are 1.3 times more likely to leave than men, survey finds. However, beyond the manager level, the pipeline is less leaky, with women senior VPs less likely to leave than men.",Women hold just 17% of C-suite roles and 20% of board positions at India Inc.

The private bank disclosed in a filing to the stock exchanges that it wrongly booked Rs 674 crore in interest income over three quarters in FY25. To offset this, it carried Rs 595 crore in unsubstantiated entries under “other assets.” The bank stated it reversed these amounts in Q4FY25 and has begun internal corrective measures.The disclosure follows an ET report citing a whistleblower complaint and stating that the bank’s internal audit department reopened investigations into past accounting reversals. These included entries under “other assets” and “other liabilities” listed within operating expenses. These developments took place around the time RBI decided to extend CEO Sumant Kathpalia’s term by only a year on March 6. Both Kathpalia and deputy CEO Arun Khurana resigned in the last week of April 2025, taking responsibility for a bigger derivatives accounting lapse that will have a Rs 2,000-crore impact on the bank’s financials.In its letter dated May 15, IndusInd stated the internal audit department submitted its report on May 8.The report found that “a cumulative amount of Rs 674 crore was incorrectly recorded as interest over three quarters of FY24-25,” and confirmed that “this amount was fully reversed as on Jan 10, 2025.” The bank also acknowledged that the findings were triggered by a whistleblower complaint.The ET report noted that the accounting issues were separate from those earlier disclosed. It cited the whistleblower letter sent to both RBI and the bank’s board, which flagged a Rs 600-crore discrepancy in interest income from microfinance and an alleged conflict of interest involving a senior executive.","IndusInd Bank acknowledged further accounting lapses, this time in its microfinance portfolio.

RBI's past dividends to govt

MUMBAI: The way RBI calculates the dividend it pays to govt may soon change, with the central board of directors reviewing the economic capital framework at its meeting here on Thursday. The meeting was chaired by governor Sanjay Malhotra and comes five years after the Bimal Jalan Committee ’s recommendations, which form the basis of the current framework.Economists expect RBI to transfer a dividend of Rs 2.5-2.75 lakh crore to govt, owing to record profits from selling dollars from its reserves at high margins following the rupee’s depreciation in the second half of FY25. While these earnings were booked in FY25, the dividend will be paid out in the current fiscal. RBI typically transfers the dividend in the last week of May.The Jalan Committee’s 2019 report recommended including revaluation balances in RBI’s risk buffers but limiting their use to cover market risks, recognising their inherent volatility. It also proposed that the surplus distribution policy should factor in both total economic capital and realised equity to ensure a balance between overall capital and the more stable portion of reserves.A key recommendation was to maintain the realised equity — referred to as the contingent risk buffer — within a range of 5.5% to 6.5% of RBI’s balance sheet. This range plays a critical role in determining how much surplus the central bank retains and how much it can transfer to govt.The committee also called for a review of the framework every five years to ensure it remains relevant.Malhotra flagged the ongoing review in a Feb press conference following the monetary policy meeting. “The Bimal Jalan committee has given a 5.5%-6.5% ratio of the balance sheet to be maintained as a buffer for us. We are at 6.5% on March 31, 2024, that is the overall framework, is being reviewed and based on that if the committee feels that there is any change, it could be upward or downward. I am not suggesting that because of uncertainties, it needs to be increased. That is under process and based on that we will take a decision as per the recommendations of the committee which is reviewing this,” he said.At the same briefing, deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao noted that the Jalan Committee’s recommendations were applicable for the period from 2019 to March 2024. “Internally, we are reviewing the whole thing and seeing whether any changes are warranted, etc. Then internally, we will take it up appropriately through the process and then if we need to engage with govt or the board, we will do it at a later point in time. But the internal review is on and is in the process,” he said.","Economists expect RBI to transfer a dividend of Rs 2.5-2.75 lakh crore to govt.

MUMBAI: US President Donald Trump’s statement about the possibility of a zero-tariff deal with India during his West Asia tour boosted market sentiment on Thursday.This helped Nifty close above the 25,000 level. The southward movement of domestic inflation numbers, which could help RBI cut interest rates in June, also helped sentiment on Dalal Street, market players said.After opening flat and dipping into negative territory, the sensex rallied from mid-session to close 1,200 points (1.5%) up at 82,531 points. Treading a similar path, Nifty closed 395 points (1.6%) higher at 25,062 points. Both indices are at their respective seven-month closing high levels.According to Vinod Nair of Geojit Investments, the market staged a robust rebound, closing with substantial gains, driven by a decline in domestic inflation and positive signals from the US regarding a potential trade agreement with India. “The benchmark index outperformed the broader market, buoyed by growing optimism around reduced operational costs and a potentially more accommodative monetary policy stance.The day’s rally came on the back of strong buying by foreign funds, who net pumped in Rs 5,393 crore into stocks, while domestic funds were net sellers at Rs 1,668 crore. At close of the session, investors were richer by Rs 5.3 lakh crore, with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 440.2 lakh crore.Among the sensex stocks, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank contributed the most to the day’s rally.

Operation Sindoor: IAEA says no report of radiation leak from any Pakistan facility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaea-says-no-report-of-radiation-leak-from-any-pak-facility/articleshow/121171115.cms,"Representative photo

DEHRADUN: There was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Wednesday (IST), rejecting widespread reports that claimed Indian missiles struck Kirana Hills in Pakistan’s Sargodha during Operation Sindoor , triggering a radioactive incident.The clarification followed social media speculation and foreign media theories suggesting a nuclear stockpile in Pakistan had been hit during the airstrikes. Fredrik Dahl from IAEA’s press department in an email response to TOI’s query stated, “We are aware of the reports. Based on information available to the IAEA, there was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan.”The development came two days after Indian Air Force’s director general air operations, Air Marshal A K Bharti, denied that India had targeted Kirana Hills or any nuclear installation in Pakistan. When asked by the media, Bharti said, “Thank you for telling us that Kirana Hills houses nuclear installations. We didn’t know about it. We have not hit Kirana Hills and whatever is there.”The ministry of external affairs also rejected reports of a radiation leak. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, during a press briefing on Tuesday, said, “Our military action was entirely within the conventional domain. Some reports were suggesting that Pakistan’s National Command Authority would convene a meeting, but those were later denied. In fact, Pakistan’s govt representatives have officially denied this on record.”IAEA’s statement sought to dispel speculation that a radiation leak led to the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Some foreign experts on global media platforms had amplified the theories, claiming the reports were accurate. The rumours intensified after some flight tracking platforms allegedly spotted a US department of energy aircraft—used in nuclear emergencies like Fukushima—near Pakistan.Another claim that an Egyptian military aircraft landed in Pakistan carrying boron, a chemical used to contain radioactive emissions, also circulated. Both these claims were unverified and dismissed by former military officials as baseless.",IAEA rejects widespread reports that claimed Indian missiles struck Kirana Hills in Pakistan’s Sargodha during Operation Sindoor.

The Trump complication

CHIPS act vs tariff whiplash

From intel roots to AI futures

The global picture — and local stakes

America’s bold ambition to lead the global semiconductor race is facing unexpected headwinds, not from competitors, but from within. As US President Donald Trump floats fresh tariffs and threatens the very subsidies that sparked a manufacturing resurgence, tech executives and economic leaders are sounding alarms.Semiconductor giants, once hopeful about America’s CHIPS Act-powered comeback, are now grappling with a new layer of uncertainty.Nowhere is the chip boom more visible than in Greater Sacramento. Intel’s presence since 1984 has long anchored the region, but recent years have seen a tech renaissance. Companies like AMD, Samsung, Micron, and Bosch have expanded operations, banking on federal support and California’s deep talent pool.German tech firm Bosch, for instance, is transforming its Roseville site into a next-gen chip hub for electric vehicles with a $1.9 billion investment, the largest in California in three decades. It's expected to generate 1,700 new jobs.“During the pandemic, we saw how dangerous it was to rely on offshore chip manufacturing,” said Barry Broome, head of the Greater Sacramento Economic Council. “That moment made it abundantly clear, we need domestic production.”But just as ground is breaking and factories are rising, Trump’s proposed tariffs and attacks on the CHIPS Act threaten to reverse momentum.“You’re starting to see the impact,” said Mario Morales of IDC. “Samsung’s Texas fab is now delayed from 2024 to 2028. Uncertainty about funding and trade policy is making companies hesitate.”The Trump administration says it wants to probe foreign subsidies and overcapacity — but critics warn the timing is poor. With America’s share of global chip manufacturing already down to 10% (from 37% in 1990), any slowdown risks losing the AI race.Passed in 2022 with bipartisan support, the CHIPS and Science Act aimed to reboot US chip production and secure military-grade tech independence. It’s working, a May 2024 report forecasts the fastest global capacity growth right here in the US.But if the CHIPS Act is undercut by new tariffs or policy reversals, progress could stall. “If tariffs are just leverage for better deals, we’ll rebound quickly,” Broome said. “If they’re long-term, capital investment will freeze.”Sacramento’s chip scene is also becoming an AI frontier. Dinakar Munagala, cofounder of AI chipmaker Blaize, says their domestically built chips are attracting attention from defense and security sectors.“We’re built here,” said Munagala. “That’s why there’s demand for our products, especially for high-security use cases like airports and border control.”Blaize board chair Lane Bess believes the region is poised to lead globally. “Talent from companies like Intel is now launching the next generation of chip startups here.”Analysts like Alvin Nguyen warn that tariff confusion will ripple across supply chains. Even consumer products like the Nintendo Switch 2 have seen delays due to pricing uncertainty.In the long term, global diversification of chip foundries may ease reliance on Taiwan. But right now, the stakes in Sacramento, and the nation, are high.",America’s bold ambition to lead the global semiconductor race is facing unexpected headwinds.

Walmart to raise prices amid tariff pressures despite strong Q1 sales performance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/walmart-to-raise-prices-amid-tariff-pressures-despite-strong-q1-sales-performance/articleshow/121192848.cms,"Walmart reported a dip in first-quarter profit on Thursday and said it will raise prices due to mounting tariff-related costs stemming from policies implemented by President Donald Trump. While the retail giant posted strong sales, it acknowledged growing challenges that could weigh on future performance.The company earned $4.45 billion, or 56 cents per share, for the quarter ended April 30, compared to $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 61 cents, surpassing analyst expectations of 58 cents, according to FactSet as reported by news agency AP.Revenue increased 2.5% year-over-year to $165.61 billion, slightly below Wall Street projections. Walmart's US comparable sales—which include physical stores and online platforms—rose 4.5%, down slightly from the 4.6% growth in the previous quarter and the 5.3% jump seen in the third quarter of 2024.Despite the sales gains, Walmart warned that tariff costs are forcing the company to reconsider its pricing strategy.“We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told industry analysts. “But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.”McMillon noted that while price increases will appear gradually, they had already started in April and picked up pace in May. The company is particularly focused on managing costs for back-to-school merchandise.The Trump administration’s trade policy has been a significant factor. Tariffs on Chinese goods, initially threatened at 145%, were reduced to 30% in a deal announced earlier this week. Some of those higher tariffs were also suspended for 90 days. As a result, importers who had paused shipments of goods such as shoes, toys, and clothing are now rushing to restock within the temporary reprieve.Still, higher shipping costs and continued uncertainty are prompting many retailers—including Walmart—to raise prices to offset tariff expenses.Although Walmart has built-in hedging strategies, it is not fully insulated. About two-thirds of its merchandise is US-sourced, primarily groceries, which account for around 60% of its domestic business. Nonetheless, general merchandise categories remain vulnerable due to global sourcing.McMillon said that while Walmart imports from many countries, China remains a significant supplier, particularly for categories like electronics and toys.Tariffs on imports from countries such as Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia are also affecting prices of grocery items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses. According to McMillon, Walmart is absorbing some of those increased costs, especially within its general merchandise departments, and is working with suppliers to switch input materials—such as replacing aluminum (which is under tariff) with fiberglass in product components.""We have opened this year with a bang,"" McMillon added, praising the resilience of Walmart's suppliers and operations despite the volatile trade environment.Sales in the first quarter were fueled by demand in groceries and health and wellness items, though the company noted weaker sales in home and sporting goods. That softness was counterbalanced by stronger performance in toys, automotive products, and children’s apparel. Global e-commerce sales climbed 22%, accelerating from 16% growth in the previous quarter.Shares of Walmart dropped 4% at the opening bell Thursday.As one of the first major retailers to release quarterly results, Walmart’s performance offers early insight into consumer behaviour amid economic uncertainty and ongoing tariff changes. The company said it expects second-quarter sales growth between 3.5% and 4.5% but did not provide profit guidance due to the unpredictability of US trade policies.Other major retailers are also navigating the tariff landscape. Amazon, which reported strong Q1 sales and profits earlier this month, managed to stay ahead of the tariffs by importing goods before they took effect. CEO Andy Jassy noted that many third-party sellers on Amazon did the same.","Walmart reported a dip in first-quarter profit on Thursday and said it will raise prices due to mounting tariff-related costs stemming from policies implemented by President Donald Trump.

IEA raises 2025 oil demand forecast slightly amid softer trade tensions and lower prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/iea-raises-2025-oil-demand-forecast-slightly-amid-softer-trade-tensions-and-lower-prices/articleshow/121190304.cms,"Global oil demand is now projected to grow marginally more than previously expected in 2025, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said Thursday, citing easing trade tensions and a decline in crude prices as key factors supporting consumption.The Paris-based energy watchdog revised its oil demand growth forecast to 740,000 barrels per day (bpd) for the year, up from 730,000 bpd projected in its April report. This adjustment comes amid signs that the global economic impact of the recent US tariff measures may be less severe than initially feared, as reported news agency AFP.US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff announcement in April — which imposed a 10% import levy on goods from nearly every nation — had triggered volatility in global financial markets and raised concerns of an economic slowdown. However, the subsequent decision to pause additional tariffs on key trading partners has slightly improved the outlook for global trade and energy demand.The IEA noted that “subsequent pauses, concessions, exemptions and negotiations are likely to attenuate the levies' permanence and economic impact.”It added that the overall macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain. ""Still, policy uncertainty is high, weighing on consumer and business sentiment,"" the agency said in its Monthly Oil Market Report.The IEA said global oil demand reached 990,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2025, but growth is expected to moderate to 650,000 bpd for the remainder of the year. This slowdown reflects ongoing ""economic headwinds"" and the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles, which are beginning to make a measurable impact on oil consumption patterns.Oil prices fell significantly last month, influenced both by Trump's tariff measures and a surprise production increase by OPEC+ nations. The IEA noted that these lower prices are likely to stimulate short-term consumption, helping to offset some of the expected demand drag later in the year.In total, the IEA forecasts global oil demand will reach 103.9 million bpd in 2025.","IEA revises global oil demand growth forecast to 740,000 barrels per day (bpd) for the year, up from 730,000 bpd projected in its April report.

According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK’s gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.7% from the previous quarter — its fastest pace in a year.The growth was driven largely by the country’s dominant services sector and slightly exceeded market forecasts of a 0.6% rise. It also marked the strongest performance since the first quarter of 2024, when the economy grew by 0.9%, according to news agency AP.The better-than-expected figures provide a boost to the Labour government, which has prioritized economic growth since coming to power in July 2024. While the first-quarter momentum is notable, economists warn that it may not last.Several analysts believe the economy is likely to cool in the second quarter, due to rising global trade tensions and new domestic fiscal pressures. The ongoing uncertainty linked to US President Donald Trump's trade policies, particularly the 10% baseline tariff on UK goods entering the US, has contributed to cautious outlooks.While a 90-day tariff pause offered some relief, the broader impact of the US-China trade dispute continues to cloud global economic conditions.In a development that slightly eased some trade concerns, both Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced progress on a bilateral trade agreement. Although the 10% baseline tariff remains, the US agreed to reduce duties on British exports such as autos, steel, and aluminum.Still, economists point to several headwinds facing the UK economy in the months ahead. New taxes on businesses introduced in April, along with increases in energy and water bills, are expected to weigh on both business activity and consumer spending.Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist, Sanjay Raja, noted that while the first quarter brought a welcome uptick, slower growth is likely in the near term amid weakening global demand and tariff-related trade disruptions.Despite the uncertain outlook, the UK’s strong start to 2025 places it ahead of its G7 peers in terms of quarterly growth — a notable turnaround after a sluggish performance in the second half of 2024.","UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2025, Office for National Statistics said.

However, trade flows quickly resumed after the two nations agreed to a 90-day ceasefire, on Monday, providing some relief to the escalating trade dispute.As part of the agreement, the US reduced its tariffs from 145 per cent to 30 per cent, while China lowered its duties on American imports from 125 per cent to 10 per cent.""With this temporary pause now in place, we're clearly seeing bookings rebound,"" Tracy added.Hapag-Lloyd, a German shipping firm also reported a 50 per cent weekly increase in US-China bookings, in the early part of this week.

US importers significantly cut shipments after US President Donald Trump announced on April 2 that tariffs on Chinese goods would soar to 145 per cent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121186589,imgsize-73812,width-400,resizemode-4/121186589.jpg"

"Fashion giant Burberry slashes 1,700 jobs, says strategic shift to boost performance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fashion-giant-burberry-slashes-1700-jobs-says-strategic-shift-to-boost-performance/articleshow/121162188.cms,"Looking for revival



Performance



British fashion giant Burberry announced plans to slash almost one fifth of its global workforce, laying off 1,700 employees. The move comes as a major cost saving move to revive the company’s performance.The cuts come as part of a broader shake-up under chief executive officer Joshua Schulman, who joined the company last year to reverse its years of underperformance and put Burberry back on course.The majority of the job losses will affect office-based roles, and a night shift at the company’s Castleford trench coat factory in England will be scrapped due to overproduction.“Our brand metrics have all shown a significant improvement in the second half versus the first half,” Schulman told journalists on a call, quoted by Reuters.The former Jimmy Choo boss has transitioned Burberry’s focus back to its heritage staples, particularly trench coats and scarves, after previous missteps including aggressive pricing and unclear brand positioning.He has also pinned his hopes on leather accessories which have a higher margin and on designer Daniel Lee.Between 2017 and 2021, the group was run by Marco Gobbetti and designer Riccardo Tisci, the company had tried to establish the group as a high end luxury fashion brand, however, it did not yield much financial success.Schulman replaced Jonathan Akeroyd and is the fourth CEO of the brand in a decade.The shake-up news and better than expected financial results sent the brand’s shares sparing 8% in early trading following the update and better-than-expected financial results. For the financial year ending 29 March 2025, Burberry reported an adjusted operating profit of £26 million, well above analyst expectations of £11 million, helping the brand narrowly avoid a loss.However, the broader luxury market downturn remains a concern. Comparable sales fell 6% in the fourth quarter, though this was slightly better than the 7% drop analysts had forecast.Region wise categorisation showed that sales in the Americas and the Europe, Middle East, India and Africa region, each declined 4% against last year. Similarly, sales in the Asia Pacific area also plunged 9%.Schulman admitted that US consumer behaviour in particular had shown signs of softening. “As we got into Q4, the US customer was keeping their momentum but ... things got a little choppy as we headed into February, particularly in the US market,” he said.The US currently accounts for 19% of Burberry’s clients. While the company did not comment on the potential impact of US tariffs, it did flag “geopolitical developments” as a factor contributing to economic uncertainty. No concrete financial targets were set for the 2026 fiscal year.","The majority of the job losses will affect office-based roles.

Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

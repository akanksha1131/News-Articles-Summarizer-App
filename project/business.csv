Trump-Musk feud continues? White House orders review of SpaceX contracts after fallout: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-musk-feud-continues-white-house-orders-review-of-spacex-contracts-after-fallout-report/articleshow/121841289.cms,"Elon Musk with Donald Trump in Oval office (File photo)

The White House instructed the Defense Department and Nasa earlier this month to examine details of SpaceX contracts worth billions following President Donald Trump's public disagreement with Elon Musk , according to four sources familiar with the directive who spoke to Reuters.The administration instructed these agencies to examine Musk's contracts to prepare potential actions against the entrepreneur and his enterprises, these sources indicated. Pentagon officials are also evaluating whether to limit SpaceX's involvement in a new American missile defence initiative, as Reuters reported on Thursday.While the ultimate intention regarding SpaceX's current federal contracts worth approximately $22 billion remains unclear, the assessment will mark the administration's follow-through on Trump's June 6 statement to journalists aboard Air Force One, where he mentioned possible termination of business and subsidies for Musk's ventures, stating ""We'll take a look at everything.""A White House spokesperson, responding via email to Reuters, avoided specific questions about Musk's operations, stating the ""Trump administration is committed to a rigorous review process for all bids and contracts."" Nasa's spokesperson separately indicated the agency would maintain collaboration with industry partners to achieve presidential space objectives.Sources familiar with the directive indicated the contract review aims to enable swift administrative action should Trump decide to move against Musk, who previously served as a senior presidential adviser and led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).One source characterised the review as ""for political ammunition.""The feasibility of legally cancelling existing contracts remains uncertain. However, the situation highlights governance experts' worries about political and personal influences potentially affecting government spending, national security and public interest matters.Another Reuters report on Friday cited three people familiar with the project, claiming that the feud called into question the role of Musk's SpaceX in the new US missile defense system. Until recently, the White House considered a plan for SpaceX, Musk's rocket and satellite venture, to partner with software maker Palantir and drone builder Anduril to construct crucial elements of the project, dubbed ""Golden Dome. "" These people said the administration instructed the Pentagon to prioritize a network of satellites for the purpose.A new framework aimed at tracking and preventing potential missile attacks against the United States is currently under consideration, which could reduce SpaceX's involvement. Three individuals stated that one option might initially forego SpaceX's satellite capabilities to focus on expanding existing ground-based missile defence systems instead.Scott Amey, a contracting specialist at Washington's Project on Government Oversight, noted the situation's paradox, where Musk's contracts face similar subjective political scrutiny that his DOGE team applied to numerous other contracts, emphasising that decisions should prioritise public and national security interests over personal disputes.SpaceX has become essential to American government aerospace and defence operations, managing satellite launches and potentially overseeing a crucial component of Trump's ""Golden Dome"" missile defence system.Despite Musk's recent attempts to moderate his presidential criticisms, including his (now-deleted posts) impeachment call and allegations linking Trump to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his outbursts highlighted government dependence on SpaceX.Before his reversal, Musk suggested decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, currently America's sole means of transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station under a £5 billion Nasa contract.Additionally, SpaceX is developing a classified satellite network for the National Reconnaissance Office, strengthening its relationship with American defence and intelligence communities.The feud between Musk and Trump intensified after the Tesla owner criticised Trump’s key domestic bill, describing it as a “disgusting abomination” and alleging that Trump’s name appeared in unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files—a post Musk subsequently deleted. In response, Trump called Musk “a big-time drug addict” and mocked his appearance during a recent Oval Office visit.However, the tensions seemed to ease when Musk expressed ""regret"" saying he went too far. “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far,” Musk wrote Wednesday on the platform he owns. In response, the White House signalled a possible softening of tone. “The President acknowledged the statement that Elon put out this morning, and he is appreciative of it,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.",The White House instructed the Defense Department and Nasa earlier this month to examine details of SpaceX contracts worth billions. The move follows President Donald Trump's public disagreement with Elon Musk.

India has established itself as a prime destination for international capital investment in land and development sites, as revealed in a recent Colliers report.During the 12-month period ending Q1 2025, India secured $735 million in cross-border capital investments, positioning it at seventh place amongst global markets in this category, according to the report quoted by ANI.The investment comprised $332 million from international sources, with regional capital flows making up the balance.Although India's portion of total cross-border investments reached 1.5 per cent, showing a slight decline, it surpassed its five-year average of 1.2 per cent.India maintains its position as a significant investment destination, particularly within the Asia-Pacific (APAC) context. The APAC region's dominance is evident, with seven countries from the region featuring in the top ten list for cross-border land and development site investments, demonstrating the region's appeal to international investors.The analysis revealed that APAC captured 80 per cent of all cross-border activity, with China's contribution of $38.1 billion representing 79.7 per cent of the global total.While China leads the market, countries including Singapore, Malaysia, and Australia have shown increased investment activity.India's continued presence in the top ten demonstrates sustained investor faith in its future growth prospects and opportunities within its land and development sectors.However, the report indicated that investment volumes across all regions remained low in Q1 2025, staying at the bottom of the five-year range, despite increased activity in the latter half of 2024.North America experienced a minor reduction in investment activity, losing ground as a global safe haven, while EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) volumes remained constant. Nevertheless, Europe is gaining increased attention, with various European investors showing heightened interest in APAC markets, including India.","India secured $735 million in cross-border capital investments, positioning it at seventh place amongst global markets in this category.

"From golf to crypto: Trump declares over $600 million income, $1.6 billion in total assets, claims report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-golf-to-crypto-trump-declares-over-600-million-income-1-6-billion-in-total-assets-claims-report/articleshow/121843615.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

In a financial disclosure report released on Friday, Donald Trump declared over $600 million in earnings from various ventures including cryptocurrency , golf establishments, licensing agreements and other business interests, reported Reuters.The financial report, apparently covering the 2024 calendar year, indicates that the president's cryptocurrency investments significantly enhanced his wealth, alongside substantial development fees and revenue from other enterprises. The president's total declared assets amount to at least $1.6 billion, according to Reuters calculations.Despite Trump's assertion that his business interests are managed by a trust under his children's supervision, the disclosures reveal that income from these sources ultimately benefits the president, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.Certain business ventures, particularly in cryptocurrency, have benefited from policy changes under his administration, drawing criticism.The financial disclosure, reportedly signed on June 13, did not specify its coverage period. However, the cryptocurrency details and other information suggest coverage through December 2024, excluding most earnings from the family's recent cryptocurrency ventures.The document represents a specific moment in time, capturing the family's initial foray into cryptocurrency while maintaining their traditional interests in property development and golf establishments.The president's meme coin, $TRUMP, launched this year, has generated approximately $320 million in fees, though the distribution between Trump-controlled entities and partners remains unclear.Beyond meme coin earnings, the Trump family has accumulated over $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralised finance organisation. Their portfolio also includes bitcoin mining operations and digital asset exchange-traded funds.The disclosures show Trump received $57.35 million from World Liberty token sales and holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture.The Republican president's wealth spans cryptocurrency to real estate, with a significant portion linked to his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social.Beyond business venture assets and revenues, the president reported minimum earnings of $12 million from passive investments totalling at least $211 million, including interest and dividends, according to Reuters calculations.His primary investments were in Blue Owl Capital Corp and government bond funds managed by Charles Schwab and Invesco.The disclosure provided value ranges for assets and income; Reuters used minimum values, suggesting higher actual totals.The report also detailed income from various Florida properties. His three golf resorts - Jupiter, Doral and West Palm Beach - plus Mar-a-Lago members' club generated minimum earnings of $217.7 million.Trump National Doral, featuring the Blue Monster course, proved the family's highest income source at $110.4 million. These figures represent revenue rather than net profit.The disclosure highlighted international business interests, including $5 million in Vietnamese development licence fees, $10 million from an Indian project, and nearly $16 million in Dubai licensing fees.Additional royalties came from various sources: $1.3 million from the Greenwood Bible (""the only Bible officially endorsed by Lee Greenwood and President Trump""); $2.8 million from Trump Watches; and $2.5 million from Trump Sneakers and Fragrances.Trump earned $1.16 million from NFT digital trading cards, while First Lady Melania Trump received approximately $216,700 from her NFT collection licensing fees.","Donald Trump declared over $600 million in earnings from various ventures including cryptocurrency, golf establishments, licensing agreements and other business interests.

Gold price prediction today: MCX Gold August 2025 contract has opened with a spectacular gap up at ₹100,300, marking a massive surge of over 1,800 points from previous levels. This dramatic move is likely triggered by overnight geopolitical tensions on Israel attacks on Iran Nuclear sites. Dollar weakness at 98$, has created a new bullish paradigm for the precious metal. While the gap up presents immediate profit opportunities, seasoned traders are positioning for strategic buy-on-dips entries.The ₹99,000 level, coinciding with the 21-day EMA, represents the most logical support zone for dip buying in this new bullish environment. This level offers multiple confluence factors:1. EMA 21 Support: The 21-period moving average at ₹99,000 provides dynamic support2. Psychological Level: Round number support with strong psychological significance3. Gap Fill Protection: Sufficient distance from gap opening to avoid immediate fill4. Volume Profile: High volume acceptance above ₹99,000 during previous sessions5. Fibonacci Support: 50% retracement of recent rally from ₹97,500 to current levelsThe gap up opening in gold has created a paradigm shift from resistance-based selling to support-based buying strategies. The ₹99,000 level offers an exceptional risk-reward opportunity for traders looking to capitalize on this momentum breakout. However, the elevated volatility demands disciplined execution and strict adherence to risk management protocols.The technical setup strongly favors buyers on any weakness, with multiple confluence factors supporting the ₹99,000 zone.

Nippon Steel–US Steel deal approved: Trump signs executive order; contingent on compliance with security agreement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nippon-steelus-steel-deal-approved-trump-signs-executive-order-contingent-on-compliance-with-security-agreement/articleshow/121841927.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order enabling Japanese firm Nippon Steel's investment in US Steel, contingent upon compliance with a government-mandated ""national security agreement"".The joint statement from both companies confirms $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and the provision of a ""golden share"" to the US government, ensuring protection of national security interests regarding steel production. They expressed gratitude to Trump's administration, highlighting the partnership's significance for American manufacturing.Following completion of regulatory approvals and Department of Justice review, the partnership awaits prompt finalisation. US Steel shares increased by $2.66 to $54.85 in Friday's afterhours trading, compared to Nippon Steel's initial bid of $55 per share in late 2023.The acquisition concludes the long-time uncertainty regarding international control of a crucial state resource that started when US Steel and Nippon Steel disclosed their intentions for a $14.9 billion merger in December 2023.Details regarding the golden share mechanism, national security agreement provisions and investment allocation remain limited.White House spokesman Kush Desai emphasised the order's role in maintaining US Steel's presence in Pennsylvania. Legal expert James Brower noted that such agreements typically remain confidential, particularly from the government's perspective.The transaction, originally valued at nearly $15 billion, faced delays due to national security concerns during Biden's presidency. American officials now value it at $28 billion, including the purchase bid and plans for a new electric arc furnace post-2028, reported AP.Nippon Steel committed to maintaining Pittsburgh headquarters, establishing an American-majority board, protecting plant operations and trade interests, while avoiding steel slab imports that would compete with US blast furnaces.Trump, initially opposing the purchase, later showed willingness to negotiate. He claimed ""total control"" through the golden share, though Nippon Steel maintains its intention for full ownership.The order acknowledges potential national security risks but suggests adequate mitigation through the security agreement. The Treasury Department and CFIUS agencies must approve the agreement's execution by the transaction's closing date, with Trump retaining authority for further actions.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order enabling Japanese firm Nippon Steel's investment in US Steel.

The rating agency attributed the reserve buildup to a combination of factors, including strong tourism receipts, the implementation of a new Foreign Currency Act mandating 20% exchange of tourism-linked forex earnings, and financial assistance from India.According to the Sun Online news portal, Fitch noted that while the gross FX reserves had improved — aided notably by the RBI’s currency swap — the Maldives continues to face structural fiscal and external challenges.Fitch projected the country’s fiscal deficit to widen to 14.5% of GDP in 2025, up from 14% in 2024, driven by high recurrent spending, particularly rising public sector wages and delays in implementing reforms related to subsidies and healthcare expenditure.

"Buffett’s BYD bet outshines Tesla slump, Berkshire’s China play defies EV price war and hype, value over volatility drives EV future",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/buffetts-byd-bet-outshines-tesla-slump-berkshires-china-play-defies-ev-price-war-and-hype-value-over-volatility-drives-ev-future/articleshow/121849177.cms,"BYD races ahead of Tesla

The EV price war and Buffett’s prudence

Global strategy: Tesla contracts, BYD expands

Warren Buffett’s calculated, long-horizon investment in China’s BYD is proving to be one of his most consequential bets in the electric vehicle (EV) industry — not just in terms of returns, but in how clearly it contrasts with his conscious avoidance of Elon Musk’s Tesla. While Tesla grapples with a global slowdown, Buffett’s BYD stake is becoming a case study in value investing outlasting market hype.Back in 2008, Berkshire Hathaway stunned markets with its $230 million investment for a 9.9% stake in BYD. More than 15 years later, even after trimming its holdings below 5% in 2024, Berkshire’s position is now worth between $6 billion and $8 billion. The gradual reduction is widely viewed as profit-booking, not a retreat — the underlying message is clear: Buffett was right early, and he’s still winning.In March 2025, BYD surpassed Tesla in quarterly automotive revenue for the first time, signaling a deep shift in EV industry leadership. BYD sold 1.76 million battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) in 2024, nearly matching Tesla’s 1.79 million, and far outpaced its rival in total new energy vehicle (NEV) sales — including plug-in hybrids — reaching 4.27 million units, according to an ET report.In Europe, BYD edged past Tesla in April 2025 BEV sales for the first time, according to JATO Dynamics, buoyed by strong demand for practical, cost-efficient models built around its proprietary Blade Battery technology.BYD’s approach to vertical integration and low-price offerings like the Seagull and Dolphin has helped it maintain margins in a brutal price war.Tesla, meanwhile, reported a 13% year-on-year drop in Q1 2025 deliveries — the first full-year decline came in 2024. The company is struggling with factory delays, increasing competition from Chinese rivals, and growing discomfort with Elon Musk’s political controversies, which have sparked consumer backlash in key markets.The EV price war, triggered by Tesla’s early 2023 price cuts, turned into an all-out battle. Chinese automakers — BYD foremost among them — slashed prices, sacrificing margin for market share. Unlike Tesla, BYD had a cost advantage: its in-house battery production and localized supply chains made it more resilient.Tesla’s margin erosion has been sharpest in Europe and China. Observers say Musk’s increasingly political public persona has hurt the brand’s appeal, particularly among environmentally conscious consumers and those wary of executive overreach.Buffett’s decision not to invest in Tesla aligns with his time-tested principles. At Berkshire’s 2024 annual meeting, he credited the late Charlie Munger with championing BYD: “Charlie twice pounded the table and said, ‘Buy BYD.’ He was right — big time.”Buffett has always been wary of the automotive sector’s capital intensity and cyclicality. Tesla’s high volatility, lack of steady cash flows, and dependence on market sentiment do not meet Buffett’s threshold for a durable competitive moat.While Tesla has largely focused on the US and Europe, BYD is aggressively expanding into Latin America, Southeast Asia, and parts of Europe through local partnerships and manufacturing bases. This allows the Chinese automaker to avoid tariffs and offer price-sensitive models in developing markets.Even as subsidies taper in China and US tax incentives become harder to access, BYD’s cost structure allows it to remain competitive in segments where Tesla’s premium branding is less effective. BYD is now better positioned to ride the next wave of global EV adoption — especially in the mass-market space.Buffett’s early conviction in BYD also complements his broader green energy strategy. Berkshire Hathaway Energy has committed billions to renewable infrastructure, creating a portfolio that spans solar, wind, and grid assets. The BYD investment adds depth to this long-term bet on a low-carbon economy.As Buffett once said, “We only swing at pitches we like.” He didn’t miss Tesla — he chose a better pitch. In a sector now saturated with hype, BYD stands as a testament to the power of patient capital, and Buffett’s legacy in the EV revolution looks more prescient than ever."," Berkshire Hathaway stunned markets with its $230 million investment for a 9.9% stake in BYD in 2008.

RBI may cut rates further after brief pause; more liquidity requirement in second half of FY26: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-may-cut-rates-further-after-brief-pause-more-liquidity-requirement-in-second-half-of-fy26-report/articleshow/121846193.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may further reduce interest rates following a temporary halt, as additional liquidity might be needed in the latter half of fiscal year 2025-26 (H2 FY26), according to a report ""Ionic Wealth"" from Angel One, quoted by ANI.The central bank recently lowered its FY26 inflation forecast to 3.7 per cent. The first quarter projection stands at 2.9 per cent, with April and May's average inflation aligning closely with this estimate. ""We reiterate our view that a) the RBI will likely ease more after a brief pause, and b) more liquidity injection will be required in H2,"" the report said.India's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation decreased to 2.82 per cent year-on-year in May 2025, lower than April 2025's 3.16 per cent.Monthly inflation figures showed a reduction of 35 basis points. Core inflation registered a slight decrease at 4.28 per cent, down from the previous month's 4.36 per cent.The report indicates that current inflation figures provide the RBI additional scope to boost economic growth, which remains a primary concern.While domestic inflation remains controlled, the report warns that external factors including geopolitical situations and trade agreements could affect future inflation patterns.""Some uncertainty lingers from imported inflation,"" the report added.Food price moderation contributed significantly to lower inflation, with food inflation decreasing to 0.99 per cent in May from April's 1.78 per cent.Vegetable prices declined sharply by 13.7 per cent year-on-year, whilst pulses decreased by 8.2 per cent year-on-year, partially due to base effect. Cereal price increases slowed to 4.7 per cent in May from April's 5.4 per cent.The report credits improved supply conditions for the food price moderation, supported by robust rabi harvest and suitable kharif sowing conditions.","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may further reduce interest rates following a temporary halt.

BIG! Israel BOMBS Iran’s Nuclear Facilities; Declares Emergency As Tehran Roars In Rage





Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards chief Hossein Salami was killed in Israel's 'targeted military operation', news agency AFP reported citing Iranian media reports.As the Commander-in-Chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Hossein Salami was heading one of the most powerful military organisations in Iran.Also read: Operation 'Rising Lion': What nuclear facility did Israel strike in Iran? Why this site was chosen Born in 1960 in Golpayegan, Iran, Salami joined the IRGC shortly after the 1979 Iranian Revolution and quickly rose through the ranks, gaining prominence during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s.Known for his hardline views and strong loyalty to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Salami was a key figure in shaping Iran’s military strategy, particularly its regional influence and missile development programs.Prior to becoming the IRGC chief in April 2019, he served as the organisation’s deputy commander for over a decade.Also read: Operation 'Rising Lion': Israel begins intercepting Iranian drones; Trump says had advance notice - 10 things to know Salami was widely recognised for his aggressive rhetoric against Israel, the United States, and Gulf Arab states, often emphasising Iran’s military readiness and deterrence capabilities.Under his leadership, the IRGC expanded its missile arsenal and strengthened ties with proxy groups across the Middle East, playing a central role in Iran’s foreign policy and regional security agenda.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday said Israel launched a 'targeted military operation' against Iran, striking 'at the heart' of Tehran's ballistic missile programme. The Israeli PM said the attack was to roll back the threat to Israel's ""very survival"".Netanyahu said Israel's attack on Iran would ""continue for as many days as it takes"" after Israel announced it had carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites. ""This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat,"" Netanyahu said in a video statement, naming the operation ""Rising Lion"", reported news agency AFP.""We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment programme.

This operation will continue for as many days as necessary to eliminate that threat.

The

Trump Card

is coming!

What the card promises — and what it doesn’t

A replacement for EB-5?

Major tax advantage for card holders

The much-hyped “Trump Card” is now officially open for registration, offering wealthy foreigners a chance to join a waiting list.US President Donald Trump describes it as a premium route toward US citizenship, for a hefty $5 million price tag.The official website, TrumpCard.gov, features an image of the shiny gold-coloured card, complete with Trump’s photo, signature and name. The form asks for basic details like name, email, region of origin, and whether the applicant is applying as an individual or a business.Trump announced the launch on his social media platform Truth Social, “For five million $DOLLARS, The Trump Card is coming! Thousands have been calling and asking how they can sign up to ride a beautiful road in gaining access to the greatest country and market anywhere in the world.”“The waiting list is now open,” he added.The website lists eight regions for applicants to choose from: Europe, Asia (including the Middle East), North America, Oceania, Central America, South America, the Caribbean and Africa.Above the details, the site ensures that applicants will be notified when access opens: ‘Enter your information below to be notified the moment access opens.’Trump claims the card offers a “path to citizenship,” but he has clarified that it does not guarantee immediate entry or naturalisation. “It’s somewhat like a green card , but at a higher level of sophistication,” the POTUS has claimed.The Trump administration insists the new card does not require approval from Congress, as it doesn’t provide citizenship outright. White House officials have said more information will be released soon, reports USA Today.Under the existing US naturalisation system, immigrants must typically be lawful permanent residents for at least five years, meet age and language criteria, and have a clean record.Trump first proposed the Trump Card earlier this year as a replacement for the EB-5 investor visa programme, which grants green cards to foreigners who invest between $800,000 and $1.05 million into US job-creating projects. The EB-5 programme has long suffered from backlogs and accusations of fraud.“Wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card,” Trump said in February. “They'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful, and they'll be spending a lot of money, and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people.”He added, “It’s a road to citizenship for people and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in.”One of the key selling points of the Trump Card appears to be its potential tax benefits. Trump has suggested that gold card buyers would only be taxed on their US earnings, unlike green card holders, who are taxed on worldwide income. This is likely to appeal to many high-net-worth individuals who have avoided relocating to the US due to its global tax obligations.Trump Card does not seem to require applicants to create US-based jobs or launch businesses, unlike the EB-5 visa programme. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has claimed that 1,000 cards were sold in a single day, even though the programme has yet to officially launch. According to Lutnick, some 37 million people worldwide could afford the Trump Card.Trump has claimed he was the first to purchase the Trump Card himself. “I had no idea who would be the second,” he said. However, the programme is not designed for American citizens.","The much-hyped ‘Trump Card’ is now officially open for registration.

Similarly, the Model X AWD now costs $89,990, and the Model X Plaid is listed at $104,990, Reuters reported.Earlier, Elon Musk announced Tuesday that Tesla is ""tentatively"" launching its long-anticipated robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22. The move marks a significant leap in Tesla’s autonomous driving ambitions, with Musk emphasizing a cautious approach: “We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,” he said in a post on social media platform X.Musk also noted that the first Tesla to fully self-drive from the end of the production line to a customer’s home is scheduled for June 28—an industry-first if achieved.The vehicles involved in the rollout are reportedly unmodified Tesla Model Ys, built with the Full Self-Driving (FSD) software pre-installed and capable of operating without human intervention.A recent video circulating online showed a Model Y in Austin, branded with a “Robotaxi” logo, transporting a passenger without a driver onboard. Musk confirmed the footage, stating that ""every Tesla coming out of our factories is capable of unsupervised self-driving. ""This announcement brings Tesla closer to fulfilling a promise Musk has been making for years—commercializing fully autonomous vehicles. The initial rollout will reportedly include around 10 vehicles, operating under remote supervision and within a geofenced area.

The rebound follows five consecutive monthly declines and lifts the index from its second-lowest level in the survey’s nearly 75-year history. Despite the uptick, sentiment remains down 20% compared with December 2024.""Consumers appear to have settled somewhat from the shock of the extremely high tariffs announced in April and the policy volatility seen in the weeks that followed,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, AP reported. “However, consumers still perceive wide-ranging downside risks to the economy.”The improvement comes after President Donald Trump postponed a sweeping round of tariffs on imports from roughly 60 countries in April and subsequently reached a truce with China last month. While tariffs remain elevated by historical standards, the White House has signaled a willingness to pause escalation pending further talks.The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index — a separate metric released late last month — also showed improvement after five straight monthly declines, with analysts attributing the shift to easing fears over inflation and trade policy unpredictability.Official inflation data released earlier this week showed consumer prices rising 2.4% year-on-year in May, up slightly from 2.3% in April. While tariffs are expected to put further pressure on prices in the second half of the year, inflation remains close to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target for now.Sentiment remains sharply divided along political lines. Republicans, who broadly support Trump’s economic policies, continue to express stronger confidence than Democrats, whose views had been more optimistic under the Biden administration. However, sentiment improved across party lines in June, including among independents.Inflation expectations among consumers also declined in June — a development likely to be welcomed by the Federal Reserve ahead of its policy meeting next week. Economists view such expectations as a key variable in inflation dynamics, as fears of rising prices can influence wage demands and spending behavior.The Fed is widely expected to leave its benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged at approximately 4.3% when it meets next week, as policymakers monitor the evolving impact of trade policy and inflationary risks on the broader economy.",The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index jumped to 60.5 in June from 52.2 in May.

Oil prices jumped nearly 8%, intensifying worries about supply constraints and their potential impact on the economy.The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher to 4.385%, reflecting ongoing shifts in interest rate expectations. Currency markets also saw the dollar strengthen against the euro, signaling increased demand for US assets.Shares of oil companies like Chevron and oil services players such as Halliburton rallied as oil prices surged about eight percent following the Israeli strike, AFP reported.Meanwhile, Brazilian meat giant JBS shares fell 6% in early trading Friday as the company made its long-awaited debut on the New York Stock Exchange, AP reported.The listing marks a major milestone for JBS, which was founded 72 years ago and has grown into one of the world’s largest meat producers. The US is a critical market for the company, accounting for roughly half of its annual revenue and employing over 72,000 people. JBS is currently the largest beef producer in the US and ranks second in poultry and pork production.Global oil prices spiked sharply on Friday, triggering broader market volatility as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East rattled investor sentiment and raised concerns over potential supply disruptions.US benchmark crude surged 7.1% to $72.88 per barrel, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, climbed 7.2% to $74.32. The gains came after Israel launched a pre-emptive military strike on Iranian facilities, stoking fears of a wider regional conflict that could curtail Iranian oil exports and keep energy prices elevated worldwide.Although Iran remains a major oil producer, ongoing Western sanctions have already limited its sales. Analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights noted that past flare-ups between Iran and Israel have often led to brief spikes in oil prices, followed by reversals once the immediate threat of escalation passed. “This is an economic shock that nobody really needs, but it is one that seems more like a shock to sentiment than to the fundamentals of the economy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management as quoted AP.United Airlines dropped 5.2%, Delta Air Lines fell 4.5%, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings slipped 2.9% as investors grew concerned about higher fuel costs and potential disruptions to travel demand. Adobe tumbled 5.7% despite beating Wall Street profit expectations, as analysts said investors were unimpressed with the company's forward guidance.In contrast, energy and defense stocks rallied. Exxon Mobil rose 2.2% and ConocoPhillips added 2.3%, supported by the oil rally. Defense contractors also gained, with Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman both up 2.3%, reflecting market anticipation of increased global defense spending.Gold climbed 1.8% to $3,463.70 per ounce, as risk-averse investors sought safety amid the geopolitical turmoil. However, Treasury prices fell, pushing yields higher, with the 10-year note edging up to 4.38% from 4.36%. The decline in bond prices, despite risk-off sentiment, reflected market fears that sustained high oil prices could reaccelerate inflation and constrain the Federal Reserve’s ability to cut interest rates later this year.Recent inflation data has shown moderation, but Trump’s sweeping tariffs and now the oil shock are seen as potential triggers for renewed price pressures. The Fed has maintained a cautious stance, holding rates steady this year after three cuts in 2024, as it monitors the twin risks of inflation and slowing growth.Overseas, market sentiment was similarly negative. Germany’s DAX fell 1.4%, and France’s CAC 40 dropped 1.1%, amid a broad retreat across European and Asian equity markets.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 480 points, down 1.12%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 also slipped.

US stock indexes were mostly flat on Thursday afternoon as investors processed another encouraging report on inflation. The S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher, bringing it within 2% of its all-time high. The Nasdaq composite also rose 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 13 points, or less than 0.1%, as of 12:23 p.m. Eastern time.Oracle provided a boost to the markets, surging 14.4% after the tech company reported stronger-than-expected quarterly profits and revenue. CEO Safra Catz projected that revenue growth “will be dramatically higher” in the upcoming fiscal year.That optimism helped offset a sharp 4.9% decline in Boeing shares. The drop followed news that an Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner, en route to London, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad airport with 242 people on board. The aircraft went down in a residential area five minutes after departure. The cause of the crash has not yet been determined.Markets also drew support from easing Treasury yields, following the latest inflation data. Thursday’s report showed that wholesale-level inflation in May was lower than economists had anticipated.That followed Wednesday’s release indicating consumer inflation was also milder than expected.Investors viewed the data as a potential signal that the Federal Reserve could have more flexibility to reduce interest rates later in the year to support the economy. The Fed has so far held off on additional cuts in 2025, citing uncertainty over how President Donald Trump’s tariffs might affect both inflation and economic growth.Although lower interest rates tend to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, they can also risk pushing inflation higher. The 10-year Treasury yield declined to 4.36% on Thursday, down from 4.41% late Wednesday and from around 4.80% earlier this year.Another report, showing jobless claims ticked up slightly last week and remained at their highest level in eight months, also contributed to the decline in yields. Economists had expected a lower number of claims.“We believe that were it not for the uncertainty caused by the tariffs, the combined information coming from the inflation and labor-market data would have compelled the Fed to have resumed cutting its policy rate by now,” said Thierry Wizman, strategist at Macquarie, as quoted PTI.The Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting next week, and markets widely expect it will leave interest rates unchanged. However, traders are betting the first rate cut could come in September, according to CME Group data.Trump’s tariff policies have weighed heavily on market sentiment over the past several months. At one point, concerns over inflation and a potential recession pushed the S&P 500 down by nearly 20% from its peak. Since then, equities have rebounded significantly amid hopes that Trump might ease tariffs through new trade agreements.Still, uncertainty persists. Late Wednesday, Trump reignited concerns by suggesting the US could issue ultimatums to foreign governments: “saying this is the deal. You can take it or you can leave it.”Globally, stock market performances were mixed on Thursday. Most European and Asian indexes saw modest changes. However, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 1.4%, reversing part of its recent rally. Despite the decline, the index remains up nearly 20% for the year—well ahead of the S&P 500’s year-to-date gain of under 3%.","The S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher, bringing it within 2% of its all-time high.

On a monthly basis, prices increased just 0.1% after a 0.2% decline in April. Both readings came in slightly below economists' expectations, AP reported.Excluding the often-volatile categories of food and energy, so-called core wholesale prices rose 0.1% from April and 3% from a year earlier.Energy prices were flat overall, although gasoline rose 1.6% following a decline the previous month. Food prices at the wholesale level edged up 0.1%, while egg prices — which had dropped a sharp 39.3% in April — rebounded by 1.4% in May. Egg prices remain 125% higher compared to May 2024, largely due to supply disruptions from the bird flu outbreak.The PPI data came a day after the Consumer Price Index showed a similar trend, with consumer inflation rising just 0.1% month-on-month and 2.4% year-on-year in May.Despite US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff policy — which includes a 10% baseline levy on nearly all imports and targeted duties on steel, aluminum, and autos — inflation has yet to show a broad-based resurgence. Economists caution, however, that the full effects of the tariffs may emerge later in the year as supply chains adjust and importers pass on higher costs.The PPI is closely watched because some of its components, such as health care and financial services, are factored into the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index.Inflation surged in 2021 as the economy rebounded sharply from pandemic-era lockdowns, prompting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Those aggressive hikes helped tame inflation from its 2022 peak, allowing the Fed to cut rates three times last year.However, the Fed has adopted a more cautious stance in 2025 amid uncertainty over the inflationary effects of recent trade measures.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

Income Tax Department Crackdown

Income Tax Department’s extensive crackdown! Over the past 20 months, the Income Tax Department has collected Rs 37,000 crore from individuals who had taxable income but failed to file returns, according to officials.Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash. ""These are the cases where people were not filing tax returns despite making large purchases. The department had reached out to them over the past 20 months,"" a senior official informed ET.The official noted that an expanded and stricter tax collection and TDS system has helped identify significant transactions that previously went unnoticed.The official indicated that some individuals submitted returns claiming zero income despite substantial expenditure and tax obligations. From the total Rs 37,000 crore recovered, Rs 1,320 crore came from individuals involved in high-value transactions.The department is conducting an extensive initiative to contact taxpayers whose spending patterns do not align with their declared income.Since FY21, it has actively used data analytics and the Non-Filer Monitoring System to identify non-compliant individuals.""Data from multiple sources is being tapped and synchronised... This makes it easy for the department to identify such evasion and nab evaders,"" the official stated.Official data revealed that direct tax collections for April-November increased by 15.4% to Rs 12.10 lakh crore, comprising Rs 5.10 lakh crore in corporate tax and Rs 6.61 lakh crore in non-corporate tax.","Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash.

India’s richest men, Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani , have seen their net worth drop below the $100 billion mark in the last few months. Currently, both Mukesh Ambani, who leads Reliance Industries Ltd, and his contemporary Gautam Adani, who established the Adani Group , are confronting various challenges affecting their commercial interests and personal wealth, according to a Bloomberg report.Ambani's ventures in energy and retail sectors have shown diminished performance, with investors expressing worries about debt levels. Meanwhile, Adani's business empire faces scrutiny following a US Department of Justice investigation, potentially affecting its access to funding and ability to secure contracts.Adani encountered fresh challenges in November when US prosecutors investigated alleged bribery, bringing unwanted attention. This followed his ongoing efforts to rebuild investor trust after Hindenburg Research published allegations of fraudulent practices at his company the previous year.Adani has rejected both accusations and remains determined to fight them. During a post-US allegations event, he emphasised the organisation's dedication to ""world-class regulatory compliance"" and stated that each challenge against the company ""only makes us stronger.""Also Read | Top 10 biggest wealth creating stocks: Reliance Industries tops list; Adani Green emerges as fastest wealth creator, says MOFSL report The allegations are expected to impact the group and its market value into the coming year.Gautam Adani's wealth reached its highest point at $122.3 billion in June, following efforts to strengthen finances after Hindenburg's accusations. These gains have since disappeared following US claims of his involvement in bribing Indian government officials, reducing his current worth to $82.1 billion, as per theBloomberg Billionaires Index .The decline in wealth isn't unique to him. Ambani, currently Asia's wealthiest individual, has also experienced a significant reduction in his fortune, albeit less publicly. His wealth peaked at approximately $120.8 billion in July, coinciding with his Anant Ambani’s lavish wedding celebrations.His flagship Reliance enterprise has faced challenges with declining energy sector earnings and reduced consumer spending in retail operations. As of December 13, his wealth stood at $96.7 billion.Also Read | ‘US Department of Justice has no business…’: Mark Mobius says US DOJ overstepped bounds on Adani case Both business leaders have now fallen from the centibillionaires category - individuals possessing wealth exceeding $100 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Ambani's strategy involves increasing focus on digital platforms, retail brands, and renewable energy to boost growth. However, retail operations show slower sales and profit growth, whilst digital competitors have gained market share in groceries and household items, particularly in India's major urban centres.The arrival of Elon Musk's Starlink in India's satellite broadband sector also poses a potential challenge to Jio Platforms Ltd's digital and telecom operations. Additionally, declining demand and Chinese exports are affecting the oil-to-chemicals division.""Reliance remains a strong wealth creator and each business has great value. But the pressure on the oil business has caused the stock to under perform,"" Kranthi Bathini, equity market strategist at Mumbai-based WealthMills Securities Pvt was quoted as saying by BloombergReliance's technological aspirations are evident in its collaboration with Walt Disney Co., forming an $8.5 billion media enterprise set to lead India's streaming sector. The company has also strengthened its alliance with Nvidia Corp., aiming to develop AI computing infrastructure in India.Both organisations face additional challenges in the upcoming year, particularly regarding Donald Trump's election implications and uncertainties surrounding Indian commercial prospects.""In the short term there are challenges, especially with Trump imposing tariffs that's going to make India's exports not that competitive,"" said V.K. Unni, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta.Nevertheless, India's wealthiest individuals continue to prosper, with the top twenty adding $67.3 billion since the year's beginning, according to Bloomberg's wealth index.

Low affordability hits car demand: Kia India MD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/low-affordability-hits-car-demand-kia-india-md/articleshow/116484349.cms,"NEW DELHI: With car prices going up between 35-50% over the past 3-4 years, owing to safety and emissions mandates, affording a vehicle has become difficult for mass consumers and sales are likely to see a moderate growth of 3-4% in the coming year, Kia India MD Gwanggu Lee said on Thursday.To generate demand, Lee suggests, govt can look at reducing taxes on cars from the current levels where mid-sized cars and bigger ones have a GST rate of over 45%, while smaller ones (under 4-meters) are taxed at over 28%.As the company prepares to launch affordable EVs as well as other mainstream cars, Lee said that the increase in car prices came at a time when incomes for many middle-class users did not go up at the same pace.As part of its strategy to perk up demand in the volume-laden entry SUV market, Kia drove in the all-new Syros mini offroader, which will stand besides its Sonet model, also an under 4-meter car.Lee said that the boxy Syros, which will come with a 1-litre petrol engine and a 1.5-litre diesel, will also be offered with an electric version over the next one year. The company has developed the new vehicle after taking into account the customer preferences here, something it also did during the development of the Seltos and Sonet SUVs and the Carens MPV.But while the company expects to generate healthy volumes from the new model, whose price will be revealed at a later date, the Syros also comes in a segment that is crowded. Formidable models include Maruti Brezza, Tata Punch, Hyundai Venue, and Mahindra 3XO.""Kia India has always been driven by a challenger spirit... With the Syros, we are further enhancing our product portfolio, and are confident of taking on the competition,"" Lee told TOI.Kia India expects to sell nearly 2.6 lakh units this year, and Lee said the company is looking at 3-lakh unit sales next year. Despite the slowdown pangs, the Kia MD said that India still remains ""one of the most promising markets"" for the company globally. ""The country is still amongst the fastest-growing economies of the world, promising a lot for carmakers.""Lee also said that the govt should not tamper with the duty benefits given to electrics, which currently are taxed at 5%. A lower duty makes them affordable, or else the prices may be higher. ""Without any tax incentive from govt, it will be very difficult.""","Kia India expects to sell nearly 2.6 lakh units this year, and Lee said the company is looking at 3-lakh unit sales next year.

Government plans law to ban unregulated lending,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-plans-law-to-ban-unregulated-lending/articleshow/116483911.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre has circulated a draft legislation to ban lending by unregulated entities, including by platforms, with violators facing imprisonment of up to seven years. Lenders, who harass and use unlawful means for recovery, face up to 10 years in jail, with those promoting such lending facing a term of up to five years.The move comes amid several complaints of borrowers taking loans from digital lending platforms , including those operated by Chinese entities, at exorbitant rates. And these platforms often harass customers by blackmailing them in case of defaults. There have been instances of borrowers committing suicides due to harassment, prompting the Centre and the regulator to step in.The plan is to notify certain activities as "" unregulated lending "" with a ""competent authority"" tasked with regulating the segment and also maintain a database on lenders. The authority headed by a secretary-rank officer will have powers to provisionally attach the accounts of the lender and call for data. All information received by the agency will have to be shared with CBI or state police.Anyone, including banks and NBFCs, with information on unlawful lending has to alert authorities. Offences under the proposed law will be cognizable and non-bailable, the draft said. The severest punishment is reserved for those who harass borrowers - with jail term of three to 10 years and fine can be between Rs 5 lakh and twice the loan amount. Unregulated lenders face two-to-seven years in prison, with fine that can extended up to Rs 1 crore. Repeat offenders can be sent to jail for up to 10 years and face penalty of up to Rs 50 crore. In case of companies, individuals who conduct business will be held liable.CBI will enjoy powers to search and seize without warrant. The draft, based on recommendations by a panel of RBI, has been circulated by finance ministry for consultation bt stakeholders.""The mushrooming of lending platforms, which offer quick, unsecured loans mostly for frivolous consumptions, without adequate credit check, has the potential for putting Indian households at a massive systemic risk. Regulators have raised several alarms on the burgeoning household debt levels. Further, these lending platforms are not most transparent in levying financing charges. Thus, this legislation is extremely timely, with the intent to put in place mechanisms of ethical and regulated lending, backed by proper credit appraisals,"" said Soumitra Majumdar, partner at JSA Advocates & Solicitors.","The move comes amid several complaints of borrowers taking loans from digital lending platforms at exorbitant rates.

$11.3 billion: Startup funding sees marginal rise in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/11-3-billion-startup-funding-sees-marginal-rise-in-2024/articleshow/116484542.cms,"MUMBAI: After two years of funding slump, investments into India's startups are seeing some revival. Investors infused about $11.3 billion into startups this year, a slight improvement from funding worth $10.7 billion recorded last year, data sourced from market research firm Tracxn showed. In the coming year, companies are expected to see a sizeable amount of funding cheques but the deployment of capital will be cautious, keeping in line with the trend seen for quite sometime now and late-stage deals (over $100 million) will take time to close, venture capital (VC) firms said.Not to say that there's a lack of capital-VC firms raised an estimated $2.5 billion in funding in 2024 alone compared to less than $2 billion in 2023 and some of them plan to raise new funds in 2025; but investors want to ensure they make the right bets. ""As investors, we are very clear that we need to see a company's path to profitability, we need to see good governance structures, assess firms' go-to market strategies deeply and figure out founders' ability to deliver. When you diligence all of these, it takes some time and investing capital takes longer,"" Padmaja Ruparel, co-founder at IAN (Indian Angel Network) Group told TOI.Quick commerce player Zepto led startup funding this year having bagged $1.4 billion in investments alone amid a surge in investor appetite for rapid deliveries.A clutch of companies including PhysicsWallah, Rebel Foods, Eruditus and Purplle also managed to raise funding worth more than $100 million from investors. There were also few big secondary transactions like Lenskart's $200 million round. In a secondary deal, shares change hands among a company's investors and no money is added to the firm's coffers. Funding was rather uneven across quarters, probably hinting at a measured pace of deal closures. Funding in the December quarter (so far), for instance, slipped to a three year low of $1.8 billion after touching $3.5 billion in the September quarter. ""Funding patterns have evolved towards fewer, larger rounds,"" said Neha Singh, co-founder at Tracxn.Yet, the sheer size of the Indian market and the shift in consumption patterns towards better quality and more premium products creates growth opportunities for companies, making it an equally attractive bet for investors, industry experts said.""There is no lack of belief in the fundamental opportunity that exists in India.

‘Impulsive Buyers’

‘Lost My Mind’

Food delivery apps in India are promising to bring biryani to hot beverages to customers’ doorsteps in under 10 minutes, as competition for impatient consumers intensifies among digital platforms.At least five companies, including Zomato Ltd. and its recently-listed rival Swiggy Ltd., have unveiled or announced plans to offer quick food delivery in the last few weeks.But how they do it varies: Zomato unit Blinkit’s food delivery app Bistro and Zepto Cafe are relying on in-house kitchens to swiftly cook and assemble eatables, while Swiggy is partnering with restaurants from Starbucks Corp. to McDonald’s Corp.While doorstep delivery has existed in India for decades with mom-and-pop stores employing runners, the last few years have seen a disruptive transformation. Technology helped spawn startups offering ultra-fast deliveries and these were lapped up by an affluent, smartphone-savvy, urban population keen on instant gratification.The result was apps like Zepto and Blinkit, which deliver eggs to earphones — even iPhones — at a breakneck pace while similar services typically take a few hours elsewhere in the world.“Quick commerce has changed consumers who have become more impulsive buyers,” said Karan Taurani, senior vice president at Elara Securities India Pvt. These platforms have now rolled out rapid food deliveries to satisfy these impulses and “enhance user experience.”Swiggy and Zomato’s blistering success has not just upended the Indian retail sector, it has cast them as stock market darlings. Swiggy shares have surged 50% since listing last month while Zomato has jumped 133% this year.As India’s 10-minute mania enters the food delivery segment, brokerages see a new growth avenue while some consumers worry about the quality of food cooked in such a dash.India’s online food delivery market is expected to more than double to $15 billion by March 2029, according to a Dec. 18 report by JM Financial. Platforms had penetrated only about 11% of the country’s total food consumption in 2023, compared with 40% in China and 58% in the US, it said.“Bistro’s within-10 minutes-delivery proposition should help the company better penetrate breakfast and evening snacks meal consumption” in the bigger Indian cities, analysts at JM Financial Ltd. led by Swapnil Potdukhe wrote about Zomato in the report.Zepto Cafe, which was the first to begin 10-minute food drops in 2022, is adding 100 cafes a month and clocking 30,000 orders a day, its founder Aadit Palicha wrote on X in a Dec. 11 post.It’ll now face competition from Zomato’s Bistro, Swiggy’s Bolt, Dash by Ola Consumer, and Magicpin’s MagicNOW. The Tata Group-owned BigBasket said this week it is in the process of finalizing the service.The race for speedy meals comes amid health concerns and rising obesity in India. The country is among the largest consumers of junk food, spurred by the increasing availability of packaged food and lax food safety regulations.“Cook time 2 min, delivery time 8 min. A ‘qcom for food’ founder told me this and I lost my mind. We are suffering from the biggest epidemic of poor nutrition and unhealthy processed and ultra-processed food which is high on palm oil and sugar,” Shantanu Deshpande, founder of Bombay Shaving Company said in a Dec. 16 LinkedIn post. “And now this.”The companies offering these speedy meals reassure the food quality won’t be compromised.“At Bistro, we are not microwaving processed frozen food and sending it to our customers,” Zomato said in an emailed response on Dec. 18. “When you order from your nearest Bistro kitchen, we make dishes fresh by putting together ingredients that are prepared at a central kitchen.”Food is prepared in “controlled environments to maintain quality while meeting rapid delivery times” and “high hygiene standards are enforced at every stage—from sourcing to final delivery,” Shashank Shekhar Sharma, who leads Zepto Cafe, said in an email. There’s also rigorous training for the staff and routine inspections, he added.Swiggy did not immediately respond to an email seeking comments.Maintaining delivery times on India’s busy and bumpy roads will be a challenge, according to Elara’s Taurani. Scaling up with a limited food menu is another, he said.But that’s not holding back service providers, including Swiggy which has expanded Bolt to over 400 cities.“Consumers just love things faster,” Rohit Kapoor, Swiggy’s chief executive officer for the food marketplace said in the Dec. 3 earnings call, describing Bolt as “a big bet.” “We’re very optimistic about the potential it holds for not just this offering but the future of food delivery itself,” he said.","At least five companies, including Zomato Ltd. and its recently-listed rival Swiggy Ltd., have unveiled or announced plans to offer quick food delivery in the last few weeks. India’s online food delivery market is expected to more than double to $15 billion by March 2029, according to a report.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116488405,imgsize-1062267,width-400,resizemode-4/116488405.jpg"

Who is KMFDM and Why Are They Controversially Linked to School Shootings?



Megalomaniac

Police Investigate Shooter’s Background and Motive



A Grieving Community Seeks Answers



Unsettling Questions Linger



The recent Abundant Life Christian School shooting in Madison, Wisconsin, has sparked unsettling comparisons to the Columbine High School massacre after a chilling detail emerged: the 15-year-old shooter, Natalie ‘Samantha’ Rupnow , was photographed wearing a shirt identical to one worn by Columbine killer Eric Harris.Rupnow, who killed a teacher and a student before taking her own life, wore a black shirt featuring the distinctive “tumbling logo” design from German industrial band KMFDM’s 1997 Symbols tour. The same band and design are historically tied to the Columbine tragedy, where Harris and co-perpetrator Dylan Klebold also sported KMFDM attire in public photos.Social media users were the first to draw attention to Rupnow’s choice of clothing, with many noting the unsettling similarities to Harris’s infamous appearance. The connection has prompted widespread debate about whether Rupnow’s actions were influenced by Columbine’s enduring legacy or if the link was purely coincidental.According to reports from The New York Post, authorities believe the Madison shooting was a “planned attack,” but they have not yet established a definitive motive. The symbolic shirt, however, has rekindled public discussion about KMFDM’s unintended association with school shootings and its place within a darker subculture.KMFDM, a German industrial band founded in 1984, is known for its aggressive sound that fuses heavy metal, punk, and electronic elements. With themes of rebellion, societal decay, and anti-authoritarianism, their music has long resonated with listeners disillusioned by mainstream norms.The band’s name, “Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid,” translates to “No Pity for the Majority,” encapsulating their confrontational and satirical tone.KMFDM became controversially tied to school shootings following the Columbine massacre in 1999. Eric Harris, one of the shooters, praised the band in his personal writings, citing their “anti-American” and “anti-authoritarian” messages as influential.While KMFDM has consistently condemned violence and rejected associations with such tragedies, their music and imagery have nonetheless become a recurring focal point in discussions surrounding school shootings.Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes confirmed that authorities are examining every aspect of Rupnow’s background for possible influences, including online communities and historical school shooting events. “We are still working to determine a clear motive,” Barnes stated during a press conference. He also addressed reports of an alleged manifesto circulating online, clarifying that its authenticity remains unverified as investigators work with the FBI to confirm its origins.The attack occurred during a study hall session, leaving the tight-knit Christian school community shattered. A teacher and a student were killed, and two additional students remain in critical condition.Authorities confirmed that Rupnow died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound while being transported to the hospital.Parents, students, and community members gathered at local churches Monday evening, mourning the victims and offering prayers for the injured. School official Barbara Wiers commended students for following safety protocols with remarkable composure during the chaos.As investigators search for answers, the eerie detail of Rupnow’s KMFDM shirt continues to cast a shadow over the tragedy. Was her attire a deliberate nod to Columbine, or an unsettling coincidence? Authorities are interviewing Rupnow’s family, who are reportedly cooperating with the investigation, and working to uncover how the teenager obtained the weapon used in the attack.While the investigation progresses, the debate over cultural influences, mental health, and the legacy of past school shootings remains unresolved. For now, a grieving community is left searching for solace—and answers to questions that may never be fully answered.","Natalie ‘Samantha’ Rupnow, 15, killed a teacher and a student before taking her own life at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin.

Global markets and economic uncertainty

Economic outlook clouds amid inflation and political shifts

US stock markets endured one of their most severe declines of the year on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled a shift in its monetary policy trajectory. The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, narrowly missing its largest loss of 2024, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by 1,123 points, or 2.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite suffered the worst drop, declining 3.6%.The central bank announced its third rate cut of the year, lowering its main interest rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. However, it was the Fed’s updated projections for 2025 that rattled investors: Policymakers now anticipate only two additional cuts next year, down from four projected just three months ago.“We are in a new phase of the process,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, explaining the tempered outlook as a response to robust job market performance, rising inflation readings, and economic uncertainties, including the upcoming Trump administration’s policies.Treasury yields surged following the Fed's announcement, exerting additional pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.51% from 4.40%, while the two-year yield, more sensitive to Fed actions, increased to 4.35% from 4.25%.Higher yields typically hurt stock valuations, particularly for companies reliant on borrowing to drive growth. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies tumbled 4.4%, reflecting the acute impact of rising interest rates on smaller-cap stocks.“We’re seeing the market recalibrate for a ‘higher for longer’ rate environment,” said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research. “The Fed’s announcement caught investors off guard, eroding confidence in the expected pace of rate reductions.”Among individual stocks, General Mills fell 3.1% despite better-than-expected quarterly profits, as its lowered profit forecast for the year spooked investors. Nvidia, a significant driver of this year’s market rally, dropped 1.1%, extending its losses to over 13% since its record high last month.Conversely, Jabil surged 7.3% after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and raising its full-year revenue forecast.Global markets displayed mixed reactions. In London, the FTSE 100 rose marginally by less than 0.1%, buoyed by data showing UK inflation at an eight-month high. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates unchanged when it announces its decision on Thursday.Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.7%, even as Nissan shares jumped 23.7% on reports of potential collaboration with Honda. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Motors, partly owned by Nissan, saw its shares soar nearly 20%.Powell noted that while rate cuts could stimulate economic growth, they also risk exacerbating inflation. “When the path is uncertain, you go a little slower,” he said, likening the Fed’s approach to navigating a foggy night.Lingering inflationary pressures and the transition to the Trump administration have introduced additional variables into the Fed’s calculus. Powell acknowledged that some officials are already weighing the implications of potential fiscal policy changes, including tariffs and spending initiatives.Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack was the lone dissenter in Wednesday’s decision, arguing against the rate cut.As Wall Street digests the Fed’s outlook, concerns grow that the anticipated “Santa Claus rally” may be replaced by further volatility, with analysts suggesting that traders may lock in profits amid uncertainty.(With inputs from agencies)","The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, narrowly missing its largest loss of 2024.

The US Federal Reserve cut the interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, according to an official statement following the key FOMC meeting. This 25 basis points cut has led to the central banks benchmark policy rate being in the 4.25% to 4.50% range. This represents a decrease of one full percentage point from its September level, when the Fed initiated the relaxation of stringent monetary measures implemented to address the inflation spike that commenced in 2021.The US central bank modified a crucial component of its interest rate management system on Wednesday by reducing the reverse repo facility rate more significantly than the federal funds rate reduction. The reverse repo rate has been decreased by 30 basis points to 4.25% from its previous 4.55%.Market specialists suggest this anticipated adjustment represents the Federal Reserve's effort to encourage the movement of funds away from a facility that is commonly regarded as an indicator of surplus liquidity within the financial framework.The overnight reverse repo facility (ONRPP) rate, which the Federal Reserve offers, enables money market funds and other entities to deposit funds with the central bank through what essentially amounts to a secured loan. This ONRPP rate functions to establish a flexible lower boundary for all short-term interest rates.""In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,"" the FOMC statement read.""In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments,"" the statement added.Recent economic indicators, including Tuesday's robust November retail sales data, align with the Federal Reserve's assessment of a strong economy marked by strong growth, minimal unemployment, and gradually declining, yet persistently elevated inflation levels.KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk in her pre-meeting analysis said, ""Debate will be heated,"" she said. ""The economy remains stronger than participants at the meeting thought it would be when they started cutting in September, while improvements in inflation appear to have stalled ... The Fed is going to want time to pause to see where we are and how policy may shift after the president-elect is sworn in.""Following Trump's inauguration on January 20, the Fed's subsequent meeting occurs on January 28-29.

"Amazon’s cloud unit bets on new models, chips to catch up in AI race",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazons-cloud-unit-bets-on-new-models-chips-to-catch-up-in-ai-race/articleshow/116444528.cms,"(The writer was in Las Vegas at invitation of AWS)

LAS VEGAS: Amazon’s cloud unit AWS unveiled new AI models and chips to take on rivals like Microsoft, which has had an edge due to its ties with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.Exactly two years ago, the launch of ChatGPT forced tech giants to redraw plans, wiping out billions from market caps of companies that were slow to adapt. AWS, which pioneered renting out data infrastructure, was seen to be losing grip on its cloud dominance over the past two years amid the AI boom.However, Andy Jassy, who built AWS before succeeding Jeff Bezos as Amazon CEO in 2021, sees it differently. “When we talk about AI, it is typically less to announce that we have beat the best chess player in the world... We are not using AI because we think it is cool. We are using it because we are trying to solve customer problems,” Jassy said at AWS’s annual tech event re:Invent in Las Vegas last week. AWS has sought to embed AI into its services and push customers to bring more of their applications by offering them a wide choice of AI models and chips, including its in-house ones, through its Bedrock platform.“With the announcement of Nova, we have made it clear that we want to compete... Whether it’s chips or models, we will be very competitive on costs,” Sherry Marcus, director of applied science (GenAI) at AWS, told TOI. Nova, which launched last week, is AWS’s answer to AI foundation models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Essentially, these are machine learning models trained on vast datasets and designed to produce a range of outputs, including chatbots.AI-related capabilities dominated AWS’s announcements at the cloud conference. The company unveiled AI semiconductor Trainium2 which is expected to chip away at Nvidia ’s stranglehold by reducing customer costs. AWS unveiled Apple as one of its newest chip customers. It also announced an ‘ultracluster’ — which aims to provide supercomputer-like computing power to let customers train their AI models using multiple chips. It will also enable Anthropic, an AI startup into which Amazon has poured $8 billion, to train its Claude models and take on Microsoft-backed OpenAI.According to analysts, rapid tech development means that no company has a moat, and breakthroughs are quickly adopted by other companies. In such a scenario, the key challenge will be to retain customers who may find it increasingly easy to switch vendors amid antitrust scrutiny.“Customers are driven by cost, accuracy & latency (data transfer delay)... (AI) models are becoming more of a commodity. It’s not like two years ago, where you’ll be chasing the new shiny star,” AWS’s Marcus said.AWS is also betting on AI startups in the early stages by offering millions of dollars worth of credits for its cloud services.AWS head of startups (Asia-Pacific & Japan) Tiffany Bloomquist told TOI: “In India, in addition to Mumbai and Bangalore, I went to Coimbatore... Even in tier-2 cities, developers are seeing AI as a critical new enabler to disrupt traditional technologies they operate in.”Analysts say that even as Microsoft has gained AI market share, AWS has brought potential solutions with its new launches.“AWS has the edge with machine learning workloads and customers, which should be easy to move to GenAI,” Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said. “The AI race is a marathon, not a sprint.”",AWS has sought to embed AI into its services and push customers to bring more of their applications.

Nissan and Honda consider merger to take on world's biggest carmaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nissan-and-honda-consider-merger-to-take-on-worlds-biggest-carmaker/articleshow/116417671.cms,"Honda, Nissan (Agencies)

Taking on Toyota



Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. are exploring a potential merger, according to people familiar with the matter, which would create a singular rival to Toyota Motor Corp. in Japan and better position the combined company to face competitive challenges around the world.Honda is considering several options including a merger, capital tie-up or the establishment of a holding company, Executive Vice President Shinji Aoyama said on Wednesday, following reports overnight of talks between the carmakers. Nissan shares rose as much as 24% in early trading on Wednesday, while Honda’s stock fell as much as 3.4%.The two have been holding preliminary talks about a combination, said the people, who asked not to be identified because discussions are private. One option being considered is the creation of a new holding company under which the combined businesses would operate, one of the people said. The transaction could also be expanded to include Mitsubishi Motors Corp, which already has capital ties with Nissan, the person said.Discussions are early stage and may not lead to an agreement, the people said.A deal would effectively consolidate the Japanese auto industry into two main camps: One controlled by Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi and another consisting of Toyota group companies. It would also provide them with more resources to compete with larger peers globally after downsizing long-held partnerships with other carmakers. Nissan has loosened ties with France’s Renault SA and Honda has backed away from General Motors Co.The move toward a merger would follow a decision by the two companies earlier this year to work together on electric vehicle batteries and software. At that time, Honda Chief Executive Officer Toshihiro Mibe floated the possibility of a capital tie-up with Nissan.“If the merger does materialize, it would provide short-term relief for Nissan’s financial struggles,” said Bloomberg Intelligence senior auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida.The two Japanese carmakers plan to sign a memorandum of understanding to discuss shared equity stakes in a new holding company, the Nikkei reported earlier in the day. The merger would help the manufacturers compete against rivals in electric vehicles such as Tesla Inc. and Chinese automakers, it said.American depositary receipts of Honda and Nissan shares climbed on the report. Nissan ADRs rose 12% and Honda’s gained 0.9% in late New York trading.In some ways, it could be seen as a defensive merger among Japan’s weaker players. Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi combined sold about 4 million vehicles globally in the first six months of the year, well shy of the 5.2 million that Toyota sold on its own. Combining forces would allow the two companies to fend off Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, at home and abroad. Toyota has taken stakes in Subaru Corp., Suzuki Motor Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp., creating a powerhouse of brands backed by its top-notch credit rating.“While this would be good news for Nissan due to their weakened state, they would have a lot of overlap and other issues to overcome,” said Julie Boote, a senior analyst at Pelham Smithers Associates. “For the Toyota group though we could see an acceleration there as well as it gathers its flock more tightly under its wing in a show of commitment, with the possibility of raising its stakes in Subaru, Suzuki and Mazda sooner rather than later.”Honda’s valuation stood at ¥6.8 trillion ($44.4 billion) as of the close of trading in Tokyo on Tuesday, well above Nissan’s ¥1.3 trillion market capitalization. But even their combined value is dwarfed by Toyota’s ¥42.2 trillion.Honda has long struggled to keep up with bigger capitalized rivals when it comes to investments in new technologies. It recently has shifted gears to boost hybrid gas-electric vehicles even as it spends billions of dollars on all-electric production. At the same time, Honda’s arms-length partnership with GM has been weakened, most recently earlier this month when their self-driving car partnership ended. GM has strengthened its ties with South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co.Nissan is in need of a partner to put it back on a stronger financial footing as it steps up restructuring efforts to cope with stalled revenue growth and lower profits. It faces pressure from an activist shareholder and a daunting debt load that has led to speculation in credit markets about its investment grade rating.The Yokohama-based company has partially unwound its complex 25-year strategic partnership with Renault, a fixation of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn. Rivalries and mutual suspicion mounted over the years and came to a head when Ghosn openly contemplated a merger, contributing to his downfall.The former chairman and CEO, who has filed a suit against his former company for ousting him in 2018, warned of a “disguised takeover” of Nissan by Honda in an August interview with Automotive News.The merger talks come after the Financial Times said last month that Nissan was looking for an anchor investor to replace part of Renault’s equity holding and that it hadn’t ruled out having Honda buy some of its shares.","Honda is considering several options including a merger, capital tie-up or the establishment of a holding company.

Your views on the IER?

Who can apply for International Entrepreneur Parole?

Have major ownership (at least 10% initially) in a US startup created within the last 5 years.

Play a central and active role in the startup.

Can show that the startup will have a positive public benefit on the U.S. by having:



Received a significant investment from qualified U.S. investors (typically venture capitalists, angel investors, or startup accelerators).



Received significant awards or grants from federal, state, or local government entities.



Partially meeting one or both of the above with added evidence showing potential for rapid growth or job creation.

What are the new threshold amounts for investment/grants?

The qualified investment amount has increased from $264,147 to $311,071.

The awards or grants amount has increased from $105,659 to $124,429.

What are the new criteria for qualified investors?

Why did the amounts change?

For want of a better term, the International Entrepreneur Rule (IER) is often referred to as the ‘start-up’ visa. IER enables ‘qualified’ international entrepreneurs (based on prescribed criteria including funds raised, to obtain immigration ‘parole’ – that is to temporarily enter and stay in the US and nurture their startup, despite not having a work visa or a green card. Commonly, IER is known as the startup visa, but it is actually a permit for eligible foreign entrepreneurs to stay in the US for two and a half years with the possibility of another extension of a similar tenure.Recently, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has updated the threshold amounts for the IER program and updated the supporting evidence required. Starting October 1, 2024, there are new changes to the investment and revenue requirements.The program has had a contentious history. Originally created at the end of the Obama Administration, IER was targeted for removal by the Trump Administration before it was launched. Due to a successful lawsuit filed by the National Venture Capital Association, it remained in force but was not seen as a viable option as the Trump administration repeatedly tried to end the program.Finally in May 2021, under the Biden administration the US department of homeland security (DHS) announced that it is withdrawing a ‘proposed’ rule introduced by the Trump administration that would have rescinded the IER program. Given this past, till date only 94 IEP applications have been filed, with just 26 approvals. The approval can take anything between a few months to a few years.What happens next? It remains to be seen. Meanwhile, TOI spoke with, immigration attorney, to understand the IER program and the changes.IER is a fantastic initiative that allows certain foreign entrepreneurs to live and work in the US temporarily. While it’s not technically a visa, it provides a pathway for founders to enter the US, build their businesses, create jobs, and boost the economy.Innovation and entrepreneurship are the backbone of the American economy. They fuel job creation, spark new industries, and keep the US at the cutting edge of technological advancement. Immigrant entrepreneurs are a vital part of this, bringing fresh ideas and a relentless drive to succeed.Immigrant entrepreneurs may be eligible for the IEP if they:Remember that it is still possible to apply if you have received less than the above, but we would want to bolster the case with additional evidence of the startup’s potential for growth and job creation.A US investor is considered ‘qualified’ if they have made investments of at least $746,571 (previously $633,952) in other startups. Additionally, at least 2 of those startups must have created at least 5 qualified jobs or generated $622,142 (previously $528,293) in revenue with average annual revenue growth of at least 20%.By regulation, the investment and revenue amounts must be automatically adjusted every 3 years by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).","The International Entrepreneur Rule (IER) is often referred to as the ‘start-up’ visa.

The allegations

Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal

Settlement and mediation

The Australian Information Commissioner announced on Tuesday that it has withdrawn its civil penalty proceedings against Meta Platforms , following a $31.85 million (A$50 million) settlement by the Facebook parent company. The lawsuit, originally filed in 2020, centered on allegations that Meta had shared personal user data with the "" This is Your Digital Life "" personality quiz app, a key element of the wider Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal.The lawsuit accused Meta of violating Australian privacy laws by disclosing the personal information of over 300,000 Australian users to the quiz app between 2014 and 2015. This disclosure was alleged to have occurred without the users' consent, as part of the broader controversy surrounding the misuse of data by the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica .According to the Australian Information Commissioner, Meta breached Australian Privacy Principle 6 by using the data for purposes other than what it was originally collected for, and failed to take reasonable steps to protect user data, violating Privacy Principle 11.1(b).The data misuse controversy first emerged in early 2018, with the Guardian reporting that Cambridge Analytica had harvested personal data from millions of Facebook users. Though 270,000 users consented to data collection via the ""This Is Your Digital Life"" app, the data of approximately 50 million users was ultimately exploited, allegedly to create voter profiles and target political ads.The scandal drew scrutiny globally, leading to fines for Facebook in the United States and the UK in 2019. Australia's privacy regulator launched its legal action against Meta in 2020, claiming that the data of 311,127 Australian Facebook users was exposed to the risk of unauthorized disclosure.Following the legal proceedings, Australia's federal court ordered Meta and the privacy commissioner to enter mediation in June 2023. The settlement reached in the mediation process marks the largest ever payment in Australia dedicated to addressing privacy concerns, according to Australian Information Commissioner Elizabeth Tydd.Meta spokespersons confirmed that the company settled the lawsuit ""on a no admission basis,"" signaling the closure of this chapter on past practices. Despite the settlement, the company’s involvement in the data scandal continues to affect its reputation worldwide.","Facebook settles with Meta Platforms for $31.85 million (A$50 million) The lawsuit centered on allegations that Meta shared personal user data with the ""This is Your Digital Life "" personality quiz app. The lawsuit accused Meta of violating Australian privacy laws by disclosing the personal information of over 300,000 Australian users to the quiz app between 2014 and 2015.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116383780,imgsize-468196,width-400,resizemode-4/116383780.jpg"

How rich is Kretinsky now, and where are his assets?

What’s his investment strategy?

What’s Kretinsky’s interest in the Royal Mail?

Were there concerns over Kretinsky’s Royal Mail investment?

Daniel Kretinsky has spent more than a decade building a network of businesses across Europe, from power stations to retail chains and media outlets, with a recent focus on financially distressed assets.The 49-year-old Czech billionaire hasn’t shied away from investing in troubled businesses that are politically sensitive. In December, the UK government approved Kretinsky’s £3.6 billion ($4.6 billion) takeover of the Royal Mail ’s parent company after he made a series of investment commitments. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds called it “yet another example of this government’s commitment to working hand in hand with business.”A lawyer by training, Kretinsky got his start in business in 1999 at private investment firm J&T in Prague. A decade later, he formed the energy group EPH , taking a minority stake and securing the backing of partners from J&T and the late Czech billionaire Petr Kellner.Through acquisitions, he created a conglomerate of dozens of companies operating in nine countries and in industries ranging from electricity production and distribution to natural gas transmission and storage, trading and logistics. Kretinsky also owns stakes in French food retailer Casino Guichard Perrachon SA, German industrial group Thyssenkrupp AG’s ailing steel unit and soccer clubs West Ham United and AC Sparta Praha.His net worth was $7 billion as of mid-December, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That makes him the second-richest Czech after Renata Kellnerova — Kellner’s widow — and her family.Kretinsky’s business empire in the Czech Republic includes power generation, gas distribution and storage, heat production and media. He also controls companies in Slovakia, Germany, the UK, France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Italy.With his investments in energy-related business, Kretinsky has made a bet that it will take European countries longer than expected to wean their economies off fossil fuels. EPH, in which he now holds a controlling stake, scooped up assets that publicly traded utilities were forced to offload by banks under new environmental investing rules.By taking energy businesses private, Kretinsky has drawn criticism from climate campaign groups, which say those companies are now subject to weaker scrutiny of their environmental performance.Kretinsky has been diversifying his investments away from energy and said he aims to target industries that provide essential products and services — in areas such as infrastructure, retail and mail delivery.His business empire is spread across several companies, with the largest of these, EPH, holding assets valued at just under €29 billion ($30 billion). He usually works with a relatively small team of advisers on deals. His inner circle includes Chief Financial Officer Pavel Horsky, who’s been with EPH since its inception in 2009 and has been busy integrating Kretinsky’s assets under a new brand, EP Group.UK parcel delivery has boomed with the growth in online shopping, yet the former state-owned Royal Mail has been making losses due to tough competition. Previous management clashed with its large, unionized workforce, and its chief executive quit in May 2023 following a dispute over pay and conditions.Kretinsky agreed to buy International Distribution Services Plc , Royal Mail’s parent company, in May. At the time, he told Bloomberg News that the company needed investment to maintain its market share. Kretinsky’s company has promised to respect the Royal Mail’s obligation to deliver letters and parcels to every part of the UK, and not to change its ownership for at least three years.The sale to a foreign owner has been politically divisive as the delivery service was state-owned until 2013, when it was privatized.He has faced similar scrutiny of deals made in France. Last year, he led a group of investors who reached an agreement to re-capitalize and gain control over Casino, a major player in French food retail.","Daniel Kretinsky has spent more than a decade building a network of businesses across Europe.

Honeywell considers spinning off aerospace business amid Elliott's breakup push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/honeywell-considers-spinning-off-aerospace-business-amid-elliotts-breakup-push/articleshow/116373580.cms,"Honeywell said on Monday it was considering a plan to separate its high-margin aerospace business, a move backed by activist investor Elliott Investment Management , which has been pushing for the company's breakup.The company, one of the last surviving U.S. conglomerates, has been on a deal-making spree this year under CEO Vimal Kapur, as it focuses on automation, aviation and energy businesses, while shedding segments that do not align with its plans.Its shares have, however, underperformed this year, attracting the attention of Elliott, which has taken a more than $5 billion stake in the company and pushed for the separation of its aerospace and automation business.Honeywell said on Monday its board had made ""significant progress"" on its review of strategic alternatives to date and the company would provide an update with its fourth-quarter results, usually scheduled in the last week of January. Shares were up 2% in early trade.Elliott responded by welcoming the company's announcement.""We believe the portfolio transformation Vimal and his team are leading represents the right course for Honeywell, and we look forward to the upcoming completion of the review and to supporting Honeywell as it implements the necessary steps to realize its full value,"" the activist investor said.A standalone aerospace business, which is Honeywell's biggest unit by revenue and counts Boeing and Airbus as its customers, could be valued between $90 billion and $120 billion including debt, analysts said.The aerospace unit, which builds everything from engines to cockpit components, has benefited from rising jet production in the last few years, though supply chain disruptions have hurt the company's ability to meet some of that demand.For the first nine months of 2024, Honeywell's aerospace business reported revenue of $11.47 billion, accounting for about 40% of the firm's total sales for the period.The jetmaking boom is set to continue in the coming years amid record backlogs at planemakers, while a shortage of planes is set to boost demand for repairs.""The setting of an imminent date (Q4 EPS) for a strategic update suggests a larger break-up is likely, in our view,"" Barclays analysts wrote in a note.A potential spinoff will echo a similar announcement by General Electric in 2021. As of Friday, GE's aerospace business had a higher market value than Honeywell as a whole.Honeywell had disclosed in November that it would sell its personal protective equipment business to Protective Industrial Products for about $1.33 billion in cash.The conglomerate has also bought Carrier's security business for $4.95 billion and acquired aerospace and defense firm CAES Systems for $1.9 billion as part of its wider shift.",Honeywell is considering a plan to separate its high-margin aerospace business. The move is backed by activist investor Elliott Investment Management. Elliott has taken a more than $5 billion stake in the company and pushed for the separation.

Why World Bank cancelled $500 million loan to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/why-world-bank-cancelled-500-million-loan-to-pakistan/articleshow/116317050.cms,"The PACE program

Attempts for lower electricity prices

World Bank goals

The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions within the time limit. The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , according to The Express Tribune.The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year which has sent a shock to the Pakistani economy as the country has almost exhausted its loan quota.""No budget support is planned for the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025,"" the World Bank spokesperson stated.For this fiscal year, the IMF has identified a $2.5 billion external financing gap that needs to be addressed through new loans.The World Bank has canceled a loan of $500 to $600 million meant for Pakistan under the Affordable and Clean Energy Program (PACE-II), government sources revealed. Initially set at $500 million, the loan amount was later raised to $600 million to help address Pakistan's external financing gap, quoted news agency ANI.The PACE program was approved by the World Bank in June 2021, with the first tranche of USD 400 million already released. The second installment depended on meeting several conditions, such as holding talks with all Independent Power Producers (IPPs), especially the Chinese power plants built under CPEC. It was discovered that no progress had been made in renegotiating agreements with CPEC-related power plants as China has consistently refused to revisit these deals or restructure the energy debt, which amounts to approximately $16 billion.To reduce electricity costs, the government is renegotiating energy agreements with power plants set up under the 1994 and 2002 policies. The Chinese-owned power plants, along with several government-run plants, including four LNG-based and two nuclear plants, fall under the 2015 energy policy. Though the government has tried negotiating over 22 energy contracts yet, no significant reductions have been made in electricity prices which linger from 65 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) to 70 PKR.A spokesperson for the World Bank confirmed that ""slower-than-expected progress led to a shift in strategy in our support for reform"" in Pakistan's energy sector. The spokesperson further elaborated that the lender has been supporting power sector reforms through the PACE initiative.Even though slower progress led the World Bank to revise its lending strategy, the World Bank has continued its support by directly financing low-cost hydropower projects, including an additional $1 billion for the Dasu Hydropower project.Furthermore, the Bank has also continued working with all stakeholders to expedite the implementation of the Electricity Distribution Efficiency Improvement Project, aimed at improving efficiency in the power distribution sector. It has also offered technical assistance to promote private sector involvement in power distribution companies (DISCOs).For the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan anticipated $2 billion in loans from the World Bank.However, by the end of the July-October period, only $349 million, 18 per cent of the planned amount, had been disbursed.Under the PACE-II program, Pakistan was expected to tackle inefficiencies in power distribution companies and reduce the growth of circular debt. However, the government has been unable to achieve either of these objectives. The government had approved a roadmap under PACE-I to encourage private sector involvement in the distribution sector, but it remained far from implementation.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) recently reported that inefficiencies in power distribution companies led to losses of PKR 660 billion in the last fiscal year. During the same period, circular debt surged to PKR 2.393 trillion, far exceeding the targets set in agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The successful implementation of this roadmap was essential for evaluating the progress of the power sector reform program, but it was not carried out.",The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

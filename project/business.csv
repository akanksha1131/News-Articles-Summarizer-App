Gold price prediction today: Gold prices will be in focus with the US Federal Reserve expected to cut rates this week, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd. He shares the outlook on gold prices and strategy for gold investors:Gold prices took a breather last week after touching all-time highs on both Comex and the domestic front earlier in the week, supported by a mix of weak US economic data, rising geopolitical tensions, and rupee depreciation.Despite a steady dollar index, US Treasury yields slipped to a five-month low as soft labor market indicators — including sharply lower non-farm payrolls, a downward revision of 911,000 jobs, and rising weekly jobless claims — reinforced expectations of monetary easing. Inflation data remained mixed, with US CPI rising 0.4% in August, the steepest increase in seven months due to housing and food costs, while producer prices unexpectedly declined to 2.6% against estimates of 3.3%.Geopolitical risk also underpinned bullion as Israel attacked Hamas positions in Qatar and Poland intercepted suspected Russian drones, marking a rare NATO military response in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.The focus now shifts to the upcoming US Federal Reserve policy meeting, where markets have fully priced in a 25bps rate cut, while the likelihood of a larger 50-basis-point cut stands at just 8%, according to the CME Fed-Watch tool.Expectations have strengthened amidst signs of economic slowdown and political pressure from President Trump, who also faces legal resistance in his efforts to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook. The Fed's decision will come at a time of heightened uncertainty, with inflation readings showing resilience and the labor market showing visible cracks.Investors will closely watch Chair Powell’s comments for forward guidance on the rate path. Market participants have fully discounted a 25bps cut however, any comments from Fed chair which provides guidance regarding further cuts in the coming meeting could provide a boost in prices.","Gold prices took a breather last week after touching all-time highs on both Comex and the domestic front earlier in the week.

Stock market recommendations:The benchmark index Nifty has ended the week on a positive note for the second straight session, reinforcing the momentum of the ongoing recovery. Over the last two weeks, the index has staged a gradual rebound of nearly 700 points, registering its highest weekly close in eight weeks—a clear indication of improving sentiment and technical strength.On the daily chart, Nifty is currently approaching a breakout from a Symmetrical Triangle pattern, a formation that typically precedes a sharp directional move. The index is trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which are now beginning to slope upwards—signalling a strengthening trend and increasing bullish bias.Momentum indicators are also turning favourable. The daily RSI has moved past the 60 mark for the first time since July 2025, reflecting growing strength in the underlying trend. Additionally, the MACD remains in buy mode, and the rising histogram suggests a pickup in upside momentum.Market breadth has shown notable improvement in recent sessions. Among Nifty constituents, 82% of stocks are trading above their 20-day EMA, while 76% are above their 50-day EMA—indicating broad-based participation in the rally.From a level’s perspective, the 25150–25200 zone will act as a key resistance for the index. A decisive move above 25200 could trigger a sharp rally toward 25500, followed by 25700 in the short term. On the downside, the 24950–24900 zone is expected to offer support in case of any immediate pullback.The banking benchmark index has extended its pullback rally for the second straight week, signalling a short-term recovery attempt following recent declines. From the recent low of 53561, the index has bounced back by over 1200 points, reflecting a gradual improvement in market sentiment.Despite this rebound, the index continues to trade below its 50-day and 100-day EMA—indicating that the broader trend has yet to confirm a reversal. These moving averages remain key resistance zones, and a decisive close above them will be essential to validate a sustained uptrend.On the momentum front, the daily RSI remains in a sideways phase, though it is gradually inching higher. This slow upward movement suggests a subtle build-up in strength, and a breakout above the 60 mark could further reinforce bullish momentum.Looking ahead, the 55100–55200 zone will act as an immediate resistance for the index. A sustainable move above 55200 could pave the way for an extended rally toward 56000 in the near term. On the downside, the 54400–54300 zone is expected to offer crucial support in case of any short-term pullback.The stock has recently witnessed a breakout from a Falling Wedge pattern on the daily chart, accompanied by strong volume activity, which adds conviction to the move. Post-breakout, it has also moved above its short-term and long-term moving averages, both of which are now trending higher—a bullish signal.The RSI has climbed above 60 for the first time since 30th May, indicating strengthening momentum. Additionally, the DI+ has crossed above DI- on the ADX indicator, suggesting an improvement in trend strength. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of ₹2925–₹2935 level with a stoploss at ₹2840. On the upside, the stock is likely to test ₹3140 in the short term.On Friday, the stock gave a horizontal trendline breakout on the daily chart, supported by a notable surge in volumes, which were higher than the previous six sessions. A large bullish candle formed on the breakout day further reinforces the strength of the move. The RSI is in bullish territory and rising, while the ADX line is also trending upward, indicating a strong underlying trend.Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of ₹2080–₹2090 level with a stoploss at ₹2020. The stock has the potential to rally towards ₹2230 in the near term.","Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, says top stock picks for this week are Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd, and Bajaj Finserv.

Indian refiners jumping at chance: How Ukraine attacks on Russia’s refineries are indirectly benefiting India’s crude buys,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-refiners-jumping-at-chance-how-ukraine-attacks-on-russias-refineries-are-indirectly-benefiting-indias-crude-buys-explained/articleshow/123893623.cms,"The US has responded to India's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil by imposing tariffs on Indian goods.

NATO’s Worst Putin Nightmare To Come True? 'High Alert’ As Ukraine TORCHES Russian Oil Hub

Russia’s refining crisis

India capitalises on crisis

India’s advantage over China

US pressure & India’s strategic autonomy



India's crude trade with Russia: Will the gains last?





Hit by Ukraine’s drone attacks, Russia’s oil refineries are reeling - but India has turned this crisis in Russia into an opportunity. The substantial price difference between Russian and Middle Eastern oil has attracted Indian refiners.With Urals crude available at $5-$6 per barrel below Brent prices, this represents considerable savings in an industry where minimal price variations can significantly impact profitability.In August 2025, Ukraine executed its largest drone campaign to date, striking critical facilities within Russia's oil industry. Ukrainian forces conducted attacks on multiple major oil refineries across the country. The strikes resulted in significant damage to these refining plants, disabling approximately one-fifth of Russia's total refining capabilities and triggering domestic fuel shortages, according to an ET report.The systematic drone strikes affected operations at 10 essential refineries, reducing Russia's processing capacity by over 20%, equivalent to 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd), creating significant challenges for an already pressured system.The attacks impacted crucial infrastructure including the Syzran refinery, Krasnodar facilities, the Druzhba pipeline, and the Ust-Luga terminal, highlighting vulnerabilities in Russia's energy distribution network.Russia responded by increasing its crude oil exports by 200,000 bpd to international markets. Although this strategy provided short-term solutions, it resulted in reduced domestic fuel supplies, causing difficulties for Russia, the report said.India, as the world's third-largest oil purchaser, identified a significant opportunity whilst Russia faced challenges on the other side of the world.According to the ET report, major Indian refiners, including Reliance, Nayara, Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, increased their Russian oil procurement.Jefferies analysis suggests Reliance could see an additional $500 million in annual Ebitda. Whilst this constitutes only 2.1% of projected FY27 consolidated Ebitda, the enduring benefit lies in enhanced refining margins beyond discounted crude prices.Reliance's recent analyst call revealed robust refining performance, with transportation fuel cracks increasing 7%-17% and total O2C Ebitda reaching Rs 14,511 crore, representing a 10.8% annual increase. Despite scheduled crude unit maintenance, Reliance maintained maximum throughput in secondary units, utilising ""advantageous feedstock"" to enhance profitability.The company's leadership noted India's petrol demand grew approximately 7%, whilst global diesel cracks increased due to geopolitical issues. Reliance maximised these conditions by expanding both domestic distribution and exports to Europe, Africa, and Singapore.Reliance's retail division Jio-bp achieved substantial growth through Russian crude advantages. Their diesel and petrol sales increased by 34% and 39% year-on-year respectively, resulting in 35% overall growth. Operating approximately 2,000 fuel stations, Reliance has secured over 6% of India's diesel market share and 3.6% of petrol sales, achievements attributed to Russian crude pricing and effective retail strategies.Analysis from CLSA presents a measured perspective, calculating India's annual benefits from Russian crude discounts at $2.5 billion, equivalent to 0.6 basis points of the nation's GDP. Yet, the tangible advantages remain evident, with discounted landed costs, inclusive of logistics and insurance expenses, providing refiners additional margins of $1.0-$1.2 per barrel.Reliance's management noted that the expected European sanctions on Russian diesel could alter market dynamics. They suggested that restricted flows might lead to substantially higher crack spreads, potentially matching the profitable period following 2022 sanctions. Reliance highlighted their Jamnagar facility's adaptability, emphasising their capacity to adjust crude procurement and export destinations, affirming their position as a key market participant.With Indian refineries operating at maximum capacity, unlike their Chinese counterparts undergoing seasonal maintenance, they can process more Russian oil and increase fuel exports. India's diesel exports to Europe saw a significant rise of 137% to 242,000 bpd in August, coinciding with Europe's efforts to reduce Russian products from its market.According to Kpler's energy analyst Sumit Ritolia, ""Exports should stay firm, and European buyers may accelerate liftings of gasoil (diesel) … given that in January 2026, sanctions kick in … This underscores India's pivotal role as a swing supplier of middle distillates to Europe.""The US has responded to India's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil by imposing additional tariffs of 25% on Indian goods, citing concerns about supporting Moscow's military operations.However, India maintains its position firmly.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently said, ""India will continue to make sovereign decisions about its energy supplies based on affordability, reliability, and national interest. Our responsibility is to ensure affordable energy for our people.""Additionally, diplomatic relations with Russia strengthened as Prime Minister Modi's meeting with Putin in Tianjin reinforced their ""special and privileged"" partnership, with Putin planning to visit Delhi in December.Recent analysis from Kpler highlights the precarious nature of India's current advantages. They indicate that the Urals crude discount, which fluctuates based on refinery operational status, could disappear if Russia successfully repairs its facilities or implements new strategic measures.Calculations suggest that losing the $5 per barrel discount on 1.8 million bpd would increase India's annual import expenses by $9-$11 billion.The expansion in India's diesel exports, particularly during EU sanctions, is enhancing refinery profits. However, this development could subject Indo-Russian relations to increased geopolitical pressures, specifically if US tariffs increase or new trading alternatives become available.Reliance faces dual opportunities: immediate benefits from substantial refining margins and discounted crude supplies, alongside strategic advantages as European markets seek reliable suppliers. The company's leadership notes that ""overall margins may actually be constructive"" should sanctions intensify, maintaining elevated margins.While India has successfully capitalised on current market conditions, this strategy carries significant risks, influenced by ongoing developments in international conflicts, diplomatic relations, and global energy sector dynamics.","India has turned the crisis in Russia into an opportunity.

AI startup Krutrim faces reality check,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ai-startup-krutrim-faces-reality-check/articleshow/123908669.cms,"



BENGALURU: What was once billed as India's challenger to global giants in artificial intelligence and semiconductors has quietly dwindled into a shadow of those ambitions. Krutrim, the AI venture founded by Ola's Bhavish Aggarwal, is now largely sustained by his personal wealth and loans tied to his Ola Electric stake, with most of its marquee projects abandoned.""The money that was raised from Z47 (formerly Matrix Partners India) is long gone,"" said a senior executive familiar with the company's finances. ""At its peak, Krutrim was burning through at least $4-5 million every month. None of it is backed by new investors anymore. It's Bhavish's own money that has been going out.""Launched in Dec 2023, Krutrim swiftly reached unicorn status with sweeping ambitions: design semiconductor chips, build an Indian cloud alternative, and develop AI models from scratch. Aggarwal even acquired Bodhi, a startup founded by former Intel veterans, to turbocharge chip design. Insiders, however, said the simultaneous bets on compute, cloud, and chips proved unsustainable. The company never raised external capital after its $50 million round from Z47 in Jan 2024. With no new funding, Aggarwal began leveraging his personal holdings in Ola Electric. According to a regulatory filing on Sept 10, he pledged 10.7 crore Ola Electric shares, about 2.4% of the company's equity, to raise debt for Krutrim.This latest disclosure, as others in recent times, underlines the direct linkage between Aggarwal's Ola Electric stake and Krutrim's survival. As Ola Electric's share price fell, Aggarwal reportedly added Rs 20 crores ($2.3 million) in cash to maintain collateral coverage. Krutrim, however, pushed back. In a statement to TOI, a spokesperson said, ""Krutrim remains well funded by the promoter and select investors as we execute on our AI strategy. In line with our focus on efficient capital deployment, we are building a leaner, more agile team that aligns with our evolving business priorities. ""The promoter has leveraged a fraction of his holdings to meet Krutrim's funding needs. Any attempt to link this to Ola Electric's share price is factually incorrect and a plain distortion."" Krutrim had about 250 R&D staffers across chip design, AI research, and cloud engineering. Today, most of that has unravelled.The chip team has been disbanded, with only a handful of engineers retained alongside Bodhi cofounder Sambit Sahu. AI head Chandra Khatri is set to leave this month, marking the exit of one of the last senior leaders.""A few months after Ola Electric's IPO, there was small trimming, about 40-50 layoffs,"" said another insider. ""By the time Kruti launched, most of the trouble resurfaced. Bhavish realised Krutrim doesn't have either the compute or the money to train AI models."" The company's consumer AI app, Kruti, was deemed ""a massive failure"" internally. With chips shelved and AI models beyond reach, only the cloud division remains, and even that is propped up by Ola. Ola Electric workloads have been migrated to Krutrim Cloud, with Ola Mobility expected to follow. ""The cloud business has no significant external client,"" one person said. ""It's become more of an ego project than a company.""Insiders described Aggarwal's commitment as relentless but increasingly personal. ""Money is directly going out of his pocket because there is no investor money at this point,"" said a former senior member. ""It's sad, given the opportunity in AI, that it has come to this.""The unravelling of Krutrim is also linked to the rising demands of Ola Electric, which listed in late 2024 in one of India's most closely watched IPOs. The EV business has since consumed Aggarwal's focus. Today, outside of the 150-person cloud team that serves Ola, Krutrim is a shell of its original form with AI research hollowed out, and semiconductors abandoned. For Aggarwal, the gamble to build India's homegrown AI-and-chips giant has collapsed into a cautionary tale of spreading too thin.","Krutrim, the AI venture founded by Ola's Bhavish Aggarwal, is now largely sustained by his personal wealth and loans tied to his Ola Electric stake.

"Savings in store: FMCG companies to cut prices, increase pack sizes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/savings-in-store-fmcg-companies-to-cut-prices-increase-pack-sizes/articleshow/123908642.cms,"Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22





MUMBAI: You will soon be able save more when you shop for groceries because prices of a host of products you use daily - from jams to shampoos are set to get cheaper. With barely a week to go for the rollout of the new GST rates, FMCG companies have begun firming up price cut plans with a few of them having announced product-wise cuts through advertisements as mandated by govt.HUL, the biggest player in this space, is slashing prices by Rs 5-Rs 76 across products and pack sizes, making its brands such as Dove, Lakme and Horlicks a bit more affordable for a higher share of households. A 400gm Horlicks Women's Plus for instance will cost Rs 284 from Rs 320,while the price of Lakme 9to5 compact will come down by Rs 76. A price reduction of Rs 30-80 may not mean much for upper middle-class households, but it can enable many low to mid-income households to buy a bigger pack or an upgraded version of an item they otherwise couldn't.P&G is also cutting prices for its brands including Pampers, Pantene and Vicks by Rs 3 to Rs 100. The change in prices will come into effect from Sept 22. In FMCG, GST cuts will be passed through a mix of price reductions and grammage increases, given that small packs make up for a large share of the product slate of companies. Firms have already begun shifting production to new MRPs, TOI reported last week. In fact, consumers can also hope for some early cheer as few companies such as HUL and Ferrero are offering discounted prices to consumers (for few days until 20-21 Sept) to clear old stock from retail shelves, communication sent to trade partners showed.Govt's move to allow firms to display revised MRPs on old packs of products has also helped them expedite their internal plans.The industry, though, is awaiting a formal directive from govt on allowing benefits to be passed through grammage increases, said an executive, adding that representatives had met the tax department (CBIC) last week to discuss the matter. Cutting prices on Rs 5 or Rs 10 sachets is not feasible.Parle, which makes Hide & Seek and Monaco biscuits, said that the company will pass on savings of 10-13% on an average to consumers through a mix of price cuts and grammage additions. Nearly a third of the firm's business comes from large packs.Bikaji Foods will be reducing prices of its large snack packs in the range of 6-7%, said CFO Rishabh Jain. The GST cuts could accelerate FMCG volume growth and gradually shift consumer demand towards premium products, said Krishna Khatwani, head of sales (India) at Godrej Consumer Products.","With barely a week to go for the rollout of the new GST rates, FMCG companies have begun firming up price cut plans.

India revokes patent of Novartis' cardiac drug,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-revokes-patent-of-novartis-cardiac-drug/articleshow/123908557.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The Indian Patent Office (IPO) has revoked the patent on Novartis' cardiac blockbuster drug Vymada on grounds of lack of novelty, potentially paving the way for affordable generics to enter the market.The popular therapy has been in the spotlight for years, with generic versions from Natco, Torrent Pharma, MSN Labs and Eris Lifesciences earlier restrained by courts, after a suit by the multinational firm. Many companies had entered the market at risk and were under constant threat of legal challenge. ""Companies are now free to launch, with more players expected to follow, bringing down the price of the therapy further,"" an industry expert told TOI.Further, highlighting the drug's importance is the fact that industry body Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance made a rare move of opposing the patent, along with two firms IPCA and Micro Labs at the post-grant stage, citing a violation of Section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act. This provision - under which Novartis also lost the patent on its blockbuster cancer drug Glivec in 2013 - is aimed at preventing ""evergreening"" and has become rare in the industry, being invoked after a long gap.Vymada, sold internationally as Entresto (a combination of sacubitril and valsartan), is a popular hypertension drug, and one of the biggest breadwinners for the Swiss company, having registered $7.8 billion in sales last year.D Usha Rao, deputy controller of patents and designs said in an order dated Sept 12, accessed by TOI, ""The patentee has failed to disclose any demonstrated advantages or technical advancement of the claimed supramolecular complex over the combination already disclosed in D1 (closest prior art, patentee's own earlier application). No experimental data, comparative studies or technical rationale have been provided to substantiate any enhanced efficacy. Further no improved therapeutic efficacy has been shown''.""I have found that the grounds under Section 25(2)(b) - lack of novelty, 25(2)(c) - prior claiming, 25(2) (e) - lack of inventive step, 25(2) (g) complete specification does not sufficiently and clearly describe the invention. Hence the patent no. 414518 is revoked and the said case is disposed of under section 25(2) of The Patents Act, 1970,"" the order said.A questionnaire mailed to Novartis failed to elicit a response. Legal sources said the company may challenge the ruling by the patent office. A patent was granted in Dec 2022 to Novartis on its application filed in 2007 for the 'supramolecular' complex of the two compounds. It may be pointed out that the company's patent on another form of the same drug expired in 2023.""The patentee (Novartis) abstained from the hearing. Therefore based on written submissions of both parties order was passed,"" legal sources noted.","The popular therapy has been in the spotlight for years, with generic versions from Natco, Torrent Pharma, MSN Labs and Eris Lifesciences earlier restrained by courts.

India Coming to the Table: Donald Trump's Aide Peter Navarro’s Big Claim Ahead of Delhi Trade Talks





: In the hand tools section of the Ace Hardware store outside Washington DC, the medium-sized monkey wrench you check out is still priced $ 19.99. The price hasn’t changed in over a year, but the salesman warns that won’t last for long. Almost all hand tools coming into America are imported from China, India, and Vietnam, and Trump tariffs are certain to bump up the prices once the current inventory runs out, he says. The US just does make enough hand tools and some of the oldest manufacturers like CS Osborne, Wright Tools, and Klein Tools have struggled to survive the onslaught of cheaper foreign imports.Back in Mumbai, companies like Jyoti Steel and Taparia Tools, which makes stainless steel flat bars and pliers, wrenches and spanners respectively, have shipped off every tool, device, and implement they could rustle up before the Trump tariff kicked in. So much so that export figures actually ticked up in the April-May-June quarter. But the real pain will come soon, warns Pankaj Chadha, chaiman of the Engineering Export Promotion Council in India, particularly if there is no resolution to the 25 percent “Russian oil penalty” on top of the 25 percent tariff that the MAGA boss imposed on India.With 25 percent tariff, there was some chance to compete against Vietnam, which copped 19 percent. At 50 percent, no chance.Meanwhile, India’s pain isn’t going to result in any gain for the American consumer, who will pony up a tariff surcharge for the wrenches and spanners the US President has thrown in the works because the American importer and the retailer will pass on the higher cost to the buyer. US toolmakers, a dying breed, are not geared to produce to hand tools in the volume America needs, and even if they did, they wouldn’t be able to match the price of the imports even with the tariffs tagged on. Wait a couple of months, that’s when it will begin to bite, the hardware salesman chirps. And bite all around, says Chadha from Mumbai, whose organization is lobbying the Indian government for help. Businesses in both countries, indeed across natiions, are hurting.Which is why Trump minions are rushing around the world trying to sew up trade deals that are not really meeting the lofty expectations set up by the US President when he first threw a spanner in the works. Almost six months after he dropped the “Liberation Day” tariff bomb, it turns out that American consumers and producers are also experiencing the fallout, not just exporters across the world. The US media is replete with stories of granaries overflowing with unsold soybeans and corn that China has disdained, choosing to buy from Brazil after being hectored by Washington. Job numbers are down, Inflation is ticking up, and there is a discernible rise in prices that businesses say will become more evident in the months ahead.In fact, such is the adverse reaction across the world to the belligerent American tone that it is US mandarins who are now going around trying to wrap up trade deals rather than other foreign delegations trooping into Washington as they did in the initial weeks. This week, American negotiating teams are meeting their Chinese counterparts in Spain and Indian counterparts in New Delhi, even though US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that Trump had invited India’s commerce minister to Washington DC. The Indian team did not turn up, so its the India pointman at the USTR, Brenden Lynch, the domain expert for all things commerce with India, who’s had to fly to New Delhi for talks.Not that it stopped Trump’s trade hitman Peter Navarro from gaslighting on the issue, claiming in a CNBC interview on Monday that India had reached out for talks. If anything, according to the Wall Street Journal, the US President got the cold shoulder from Modi after he began dissing New Delhi. In a story headlined Modi’s Strategy for Mending Ties With Trump: a Stiff Upper Lip, it cited an Indian official saying the US sought a leader-level phone call the week of July 28 to help break an impasse over trade, but India was reluctant.There are now growing signs that the US has shot itself in the foot with its tariff tantrums. Over the weekend, amid dismal job numbers, commerce secretary Lutnick said ‘The economy that Donald Trump owns starts at the end of this year.” On Tuesday, Trump called for ending quarterly earnings reports and switch to companies reporting every six months, because, he said, “ it will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies. ”Most striking was Trump's outreach to South Korea after his immigration enforcers had handcuffed and deported almost 400 South Korean workers from a Hyundai plant in Georgia for working with the wrong kind of visas, causing outrage in Seoul, where some of the returning workers swore never to return to the US. ""I don’t want to frighten off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside Countries or Companies. We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own “game,” sometime into the not too distant future!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.","Almost all hand tools coming into America are imported from China, India, and Vietnam, and Trump tariffs are certain to bump up the prices.

Donald Trump pushes to scrap quarterly earnings reports!

US President Donald Trump has renewed his call to end quarterly earnings reports for publicly traded companies, suggesting instead a six-month reporting period to ease costs and allow executives to focus on running their businesses, AP reported.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote, “This will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.” He proposed that securities regulators review the existing three-month requirement, which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has enforced since 1970.Trump first pushed for a review of quarterly reporting during his previous term, but no changes were implemented. The issue has gained renewed attention after the Long Term Stock Exchange, based in San Francisco, said last week it would petition the SEC to remove the quarterly mandate. The exchange lists companies prioritising long-term growth over short-term performance.Supporters of the shift argue that quarterly reporting is costly, time-consuming, and discourages companies from going public. They contend that frequent reporting can prompt executives to focus excessively on hitting short-term earnings targets rather than long-term strategic planning.Critics, however, emphasise that quarterly reports provide investors with timely financial information and help identify emerging risks, making them a key tool for transparency in public markets.","US President Donald Trump has renewed his call to end quarterly earnings reports for publicly traded companies.

Americans will be able to continue using TikTok, as a framework deal has been reached for the ownership of the social video platform, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent announced on Monday.The remarks came after weekend trade talks between the United States and China in Spain.Speaking at a press conference in Madrid, Bessent said that Trump and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping are speaking on Friday to potentially finalise the agreement.Bessent explained that the goal of the framework deal is to transfer TikTok’s ownership to US control. “We are not going to talk about the commercial terms of the deal,” he said.“It’s between two private parties. But the commercial terms have been agreed upon.”Chinese officials have not yet confirmed Bessent’s remarks and were absent from the press briefing, AP reported.The Madrid meeting marked the fourth round of trade talks since Trump launched tariffs on Chinese goods in April. Officials are now preparing for a possible Trump-Xi summit, though nothing has been confirmed. Analysts caution that potential trade hurdles could delay any visit.The issue of TikTok’s ownership has been politically charged in Washington.During Joe Biden’s Democratic presidency, both Congress and the White House invoked national security grounds to approve a US ban on the app unless its parent company, ByteDance, divested its controlling stake.Trump, however, has repeatedly extended the deadline for TikTok’s shutdown, despite legislation allowing only a single 90-day reprieve, and only if a deal and formal notification to Congress were in place.TikTok is one of more than 100 apps created by ByteDance, a company founded in 2012 by Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yiming and headquartered in Beijing’s Haidian district. ByteDance first launched Douyin, a short-video app for China, in 2016, followed by TikTok for international markets. The company later acquired Musical.ly, a lip-syncing platform popular with Western teens, and merged it with TikTok, while keeping Douyin separate for Chinese users.The app quickly gained global popularity, becoming the first Chinese platform to achieve major success in Western markets. Unlike traditional social media platforms that focused on building user connections, TikTok’s algorithm recommended content tailored to individual interests.Its light-hearted videos and music clips earned it a reputation as a fun, authentic corner of the internet, and gave creators an opportunity to build audiences. TikTok was instrumental in launching the career of music artists such as Lil Nas X.The platform’s popularity soared during Covid-19 lockdowns, when viral dances became a cultural fixture. Competitors soon followed, with Instagram rolling out Reels and YouTube introducing Shorts to capture the short-form video trend. By then, TikTok was firmly established as a global sensation.But success brought scrutiny as US officials have voiced concerns about ByteDance’s Chinese origins, citing national laws that could compel companies to share data with the Beijing government. Another sticking point has been TikTok’s proprietary algorithm, which dictates what content users see.",US treasury secretary Scott Bessent announced that a framework deal has been reached for the ownership of the social video platform.

US stocks climbed on Monday, with the S&P 500 inching closer to fresh all-time highs, as Tesla shares surged and investors positioned for the Federal Reserve’s key policy meeting later this week.Tesla gained 7.2% after CEO Elon Musk bought about $1 billion worth of shares through a trust, signalling confidence in the electric vehicle maker despite its slight year-to-date losses.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 43 points, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.5% by 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, AP reported.Gains in Tesla offset a 1.6% fall in Nvidia shares after Chinese regulators accused the chipmaker of violating antimonopoly laws, though no immediate penalties were announced. Investors are now focused on the Fed’s two-day meeting ending Wednesday, widely expected to deliver the first rate cut of 2025.Market watchers are paying close attention to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post-meeting press conference and updated projections for interest rates and economic growth, which could shape investor sentiment in the coming months.Political pressure adds another layer of uncertainty. President Donald Trump intensified his push for aggressive rate cuts, writing on his Truth Social account: “‘Too Late’ must cut interest rates now, and bigger than he had in mind.”Analysts say Trump’s comments could influence market expectations, even as concerns over inflation and a slowing US jobs market complicate the Fed’s decision-making. Treasury yields fell slightly, with the 10-year note down to 4.04% from 4.06%, reflecting expectations of monetary easing.Globally, France’s CAC 40 rose 1%, while other European and Asian indexes recorded more moderate gains, mirroring cautious optimism ahead of the Fed’s announcement. Analysts warn that higher inflation or a further slowdown in the labor market could curtail future rate cuts, potentially creating volatility for stocks that have already climbed on the assumption of easing.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 43 points, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.5% by 9:35 a.m. Eastern time.

Elon Musk buys Tesla shares worth $1 billion! Stock surges in pre-market trading; 2.5 million shares bought,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-buys-tesla-shares-worth-1-billion-stock-surges-in-pre-market-trading-2-5-million-shares-bought/articleshow/123900931.cms,"



Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk purchased about more than 2.5 million shares worth $1 billion, according to a regulatory filing, reported news agency AP.The billionaire bought the stock indirectly through a trust on September 12, the filing showed.Tesla shares jumped as much as 7.3% before the start of regular trading, putting the stock on track to erase a year-to-date decline.The purchases come shortly after Tesla unveiled a proposed pay package for Musk earlier this month that could potentially make him the world’s first trillion-dollar executive.The package, if approved by shareholders at Tesla’s annual meeting on November 6, would grant Musk shares equivalent to as much as 12% of the company in 12 separate tranches, contingent on meeting ambitious performance targets, according to AP. These include major increases in vehicle production, operating profit, and Tesla’s market value. The plan is structured entirely in stock, not cash.To unlock the first tranche, equivalent to 1% of Tesla, Musk would need to push the company’s valuation to $2 trillion—roughly double its current market worth—while achieving other milestones. Realizing the full package and potentially becoming the world’s first trillion-dollar executive would require Tesla’s market capitalization to climb to $8.5 trillion, more than twice that of the world’s current most valuable company, Nvidia.Tesla has faced a challenging year, with declining sales partly attributed to backlash over Musk’s affiliation with former US President Donald Trump, and increasing competition from Detroit automakers as well as Chinese EV manufacturers. Investors have also expressed concern over Musk’s extensive involvement in Washington earlier this year, where he took a prominent role in the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the federal government’s size.The shareholder vote on Musk’s proposed pay package on November 6 will determine whether the CEO can begin collecting shares under the ambitious new compensation plan.","Elon Musk purchased about more than 2.5 million shares worth $1 billion.

Trump Demands Crushing NATO Tariffs On China, Beijing Warns ‘sanctions Only Fuel Global Chaos’

China slams Trump’s call for tariffs





China has reacted strongly to the Donald Trump administration’s call to G7 and NATO to impose tariffs on countries that import Russian crude oil. The world’s second largest economy has called US statements as a sign of ‘unilateral bullying’ and has also warned of countermeasures.This strong stance from China emerged despite ongoing economic and trade discussions between Chinese and American delegations meeting for their second day in Spain on Monday.US President Donald Trump urged NATO nations to implement substantial tariffs ranging from 50 to 100 per cent on China and cease Russian oil purchases to assist in resolving the Ukraine conflict.Treasury Secretary Bessent spoke with G7 finance ministers, emphasising President Trump's suggestion for bloc partners to join the US in implementing tariffs on nations buying Russian oil to conclude the Ukraine war.In response to the US urging G7 and NATO nations to levy tariffs on Chinese imports of Russian oil, Beijing firmly slammed this on Monday as ""typical act of unilateral bullying"" and ""economic coercion"", whilst warning of retaliatory actions should nations comply with Washington's request.Also Read | India pushes back against Trump pressure: Russia crude imports rise to $3.4 bn, close to China’s $3.64 bn; EU buys fossil fuels too During a scheduled press conference, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian defended China's energy partnerships globally, including with Russia, stating these arrangements were legitimate and beyond reproach.Lin was responding to reports about the US seeking collective action from G7 and NATO allies to implement additional tariffs on China's Russian oil purchases, aimed at compelling Beijing to assist in resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict.""The US move is a typical act of unilateral bullying and economic coercion, which seriously undermines international trade rules and threatens the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains,"" Lin asserted.""Facts have proven that coercion and pressure are unpopular and will not solve the problem.

"Energy mix outlook 2050: Natural gas only fossil fuel to rise in US, China, India; coal and oil to decline globally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/energy-mix-outlook-2050-natural-gas-only-fossil-fuel-to-rise-in-us-china-india-coal-and-oil-to-decline-globally/articleshow/123893793.cms,"AI image





Natural gas will be the only fossil fuel to record an increase in the energy mix of the United States, China, and India by 2050, even as coal and oil usage decline globally, according to a sector update by Nuvama Institutional Equities, citing S&P Global Commodity Insights.“By 2050, gas shall be the only fossil fuel with a potential increase in the energy mix for the US, China, and India,” the report stated.As per news agency ANI, it noted that despite a sharp rise in renewable capacity worldwide, fossil fuels will continue to dominate the energy basket in major economies.Renewables are projected to grow from 4 per cent at present to about 20 per cent by 2050, while fossil fuels are still expected to make up more than 50 per cent.In India, the report highlighted, the current energy mix is heavily skewed towards fossil fuels, which account for 77 per cent, while renewables stand at just 2 per cent. By 2050, fossil fuels are expected to drop to 66 per cent and renewables to rise to 16 per cent. Gas, the study said, will emerge as a “transition fuel,” offering flexibility and cleaner alternatives to coal.“In the US, Europe and Southeast Asia, coal-to-gas substitution has been a favourable transition, while India has lagged in leveraging gas in the power sector,” the report observed, as per ANI.It added that scalability and commercial challenges hinder a direct shift from coal to renewables, making gas a critical bridge on the path to net zero.The report also flagged the role of government schemes in aiding the transition. “The category of ‘other energy sources’, essentially traditional biomass (cooking), is declining sharply—being replaced by LPG. Government schemes such as ‘PAHAL’ and targeted LPG subsidies have driven this shift, leading to a reduction from 38 per cent to 19 per cent with expected further decline,” it noted.While initiatives like the National Hydrogen Mission and GST cuts to support renewables demonstrate intent, the study cautioned that without systemic flexibility, gas market reforms, and scaled-up storage capacity, India risks missing both its near-term and long-term climate ambitions.“Gas, as the cleanest fossil fuel, could play a balancing role if supported through tax and pricing reforms,” the report said, adding that without such steps, the country may fall short of its 2070 net-zero target.","Natural gas will be the only fossil fuel to record an increase in the energy mix of the United States, China, and India by 2050, according to a sector update by Nuvama Institutional Equities.

Consumer spending weakens further



Government cautions on risks ahead



Property slump deepens



Beijing pushes stimulus measures



Exports lose momentum



Investment activity falters







China’s economy lost further steam in August, with factory output and retail sales both underperforming expectations, raising pressure on Beijing to roll out fresh stimulus as weak consumption and a property slump weigh on growth.According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), industrial output rose 5.2 per cent year-on-year in August, slowing from July’s 5.7 per cent increase. The figure fell short of forecasts of 5.7 per cent in a Reuters poll and was the weakest pace since the same month last year.Manufacturing activity was hit by extreme summer weather, with China experiencing its hottest season since 1961 compounded by the longest rainy season for the same period, as per Reuters.Retail sales, a key measure of consumer demand, expanded 3.4 per cent in August, down from July’s 3.7 per cent and below expectations of 3.9 per cent. The reading marked the slowest growth since November, highlighting households’ caution as property wealth shrinks and the job market remains subdued.Households have tightened spending amid shrinking real estate wealth, while business confidence has faltered and the labour market weakened.The NBS said the economy was “generally stable” in August but admitted that “many unstable and uncertain factors in the external environment” remained. “The economy is confronted with multiple risks and challenges,” spokesperson Fu Linghui cautioned, according to the South China Morning Post.He added that policymakers must “fully implement macro policies” and focus on stabilising jobs, businesses, markets and expectations.Official data also showed that the overall urban unemployment rate edged up to 5.3 per cent in August, compared with 5.2 per cent in July.The property downturn continued to be a major drag. Official data showed new home prices slipped 0.3 per cent month-on-month in August and 2.5 per cent from a year earlier.Property investment between January and August dropped 12.9 per cent compared with the same period last year, extending a 12 per cent fall in the first seven months, the SCMP reported. New home sales by floor area were also down 4.7 per cent in the first eight months of 2025.With household wealth eroded and consumer confidence low, Beijing has been trying to stimulate spending.A year-long subsidy plan was unveiled last month to cover interest on personal consumer loans, while a trade-in programme for home appliances has boosted sales, though some provinces have already suspended parts of the scheme due to funding shortages, according to the SCMP.Externally, exports also lost momentum. Goods shipments recorded the slowest growth in six months in August, with exports to the United States plunging more than 33 per cent despite the current tariff truce, the SCMP reported.Producers on both sides of the Pacific are watching to see if the two largest economies can navigate a path beyond the truce.Investment activity weakened further, with fixed-asset investment rising only 0.5 per cent in the first eight months of 2025, down from 1.6 per cent in January to July, and well below expectations of a 1.4 per cent increase, Reuters reported.Zheng Shanjie, head of China’s state planner, pledged last week that Beijing would make “full use of fiscal and monetary policies” to help meet its annual growth goal of around 5 per cent. He also promised to fast-track new financial tools in the second half of the year.","Industrial output rose 5.2 per cent year-on-year in August, slowing from July’s 5.7 per cent.

Market watch: Asian stocks steady ahead of Fed decision; oil holds firm after Ukraine strikes Russian refineries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-watch-asian-stocks-steady-ahead-of-fed-decision-oil-holds-firm-after-ukraine-strikes-russian-refineries/articleshow/123891227.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AFP)





Asian equities were mixed on Monday as investors braced for an expected interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve later this week, while oil prices held steady after Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian refineries raised concerns about supply disruptions.Markets have rallied in recent weeks on signs of cooling US inflation and softer jobs data, which give the Fed space to resume its rate-cutting cycle.According to news agency Reuters, traders are fully pricing in a 25-basis-point reduction, taking the funds rate to 4.0–4.25 per cent, though a small chance of a larger 50-point move remains. Futures also suggest as much as 125 basis points of easing could follow over the coming months.Attention will be on the Fed’s updated projections and comments from Chair Jerome Powell, with investors looking for signals on the pace of further reductions. “After cutting policy rates 25bp, Chair Powell is likely to guide toward a series of further rate cuts,” said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief US economist at Citi, cited by Reuters.US President Donald Trump has continued pressing the central bank, saying on Sunday that “I think you have a big cut.It’s perfect for cutting.”In Asia, trading was subdued with Japan shut for a holiday. Hong Kong and Singapore edged higher, while Shanghai slipped after data showed weaker-than-expected growth in retail sales and factory output.South Korea hit another record after the government dropped plans to raise capital gains tax on investors, AFP reported.Losses were seen in Sydney, Taipei, Manila and Wellington, with Australian lender ANZ sliding after agreeing to pay a record A$240 million fine over misconduct.Meanwhile, crude oil prices were little changed in early trade after climbing more than 1 per cent last week. Brent crude added 0.4 per cent to $67.28 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate rose 0.5 per cent to $63.01, according to AFP.Reuters reported that markets remain cautious after Ukrainian drones hit major Russian energy sites, including the Primorsk terminal, which handles about one million barrels per day and the Kirishi refinery, one of Russia’s largest processing plants. JPMorgan analysts said the attacks “suggest a growing willingness to disrupt international oil markets, which has the potential to add upside pressure on oil prices. ”Geopolitics also loomed large as Washington and Beijing resumed trade talks in Madrid. The discussions, led by US treasury secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, will cover tariffs and disputes over Chinese apps.At the same time, Trump reiterated his call for Europe to match US sanctions on Russian energy, warning, “I don’t want them to buy oil.”","Markets have rallied in recent weeks on signs of cooling US inflation and softer jobs data.

US Tariff War: Donald Trump Blames Russian Oil Imports For India Action, Bessent Pushes EU Action





After threatening tariffs and targeting China over its purchase of Russian oil, US President Donald Trump has now shifted his focus to European allies. He signalled that he does not want European nations to continue buying oil from Russia and criticised their sanctions as ""not tough enough. ""Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump reiterated his longstanding concerns over the Ukraine war and his desire to mediate a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv.He said, ""Europe is buying oil from Russia. I don’t want them to buy oil -- and the sanctions that they’re putting on are not tough enough. I’m willing to do sanctions, but they’re going to have to toughen up their sanctions commensurate with what I’m doing.""Trump argued that Moscow benefits financially from oil sales and its key buyers. He has repeatedly called out India, China, and now European countries for purchasing Russian oil -- even imposing a 50 per cent tariff on India over what he called its “massive oil purchase” from Russia.Recently, Trump urged Nato allies to sanction Beijing at rates of 50 to 100 per cent, accusing China of funding Russia and strengthening its military capacity in the Ukraine conflict.Beijing responded indirectly, with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi saying China is committed to “promoting peace talks to resolve hot-spot issues,” and that “wars cannot solve problems and sanctions would only complicate them.”China also clarified that “it does not participate in or plan wars” and emphasised dialogue, while calling for closer cooperation with Europe. Wang Yi made these remarks during his meeting with Slovenian counterpart Tanja Fajon.Notably, in this latest push, Trump left India out of his criticism, amid signs Washington and New Delhi are working on a separate agreement.","US President Donald Trump has shifted his focus to European allies.

The United States and China launched trade talks in Madrid on Sunday, with both sides confirming discussions on economic issues as well as the ongoing dispute over TikTok, according to AFP. The meeting brings together US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at a time when trade tensions between the two powers remain unresolved.“The Chinese and US delegations convened here on Sunday for talks on economic and trade issues,” China’s official Xinhua news agency reported from Madrid. The Spanish government also confirmed the talks, which are being held at the Palacio de Santa Cruz, the headquarters of Spain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.The Chinese delegation will remain in Madrid until Wednesday, officials said.Trade relations between Washington and Beijing have been marked by volatility this year, with both sides imposing tariffs that reached triple digits at their peak, disrupting global supply chains. However, the two governments agreed to de-escalate tensions, temporarily reducing tariffs to 30 percent on US exports to China and 10 percent on Chinese goods entering the United States.In August, the countries agreed to delay the reimposition of higher duties for another 90 days, keeping the pause on steeper tariffs in place until November 10.Alongside trade, the TikTok dispute is also a major item on the agenda. The US has set September 17 as the deadline for the social media platform to secure a non-Chinese buyer or face a nationwide ban. President Donald Trump has already extended the deadline three times.China’s commerce ministry last week urged Washington to resolve the issue through dialogue. “We call on the United States to work with China on the basis of mutual respect and equal consultations, to resolve each other’s concerns through dialogue and find a solution to the problem,” it said in a statement.A federal law requiring TikTok to be sold or banned on national security grounds had been set to take effect the day before Trump’s January inauguration.According to AFP, the Madrid talks mark the latest attempt by the world’s two largest economies to navigate a fraught relationship that has unsettled global markets.","US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng meet in Madrid.

‘Do As I Say Or…’: Trump Loses Temper At NATO Nations Buying Russian Oil; Warns Them To Stop…





China has hit back strongly at Donald Trump-led US after Washington called on its Nato allies to impose major sanctions on Beijing -- 50 to 100 per cent -- alleging China’s role in funding Russia and adding to its lethal potency in the war against Ukraine.In response, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi reiterated that China is committed to promoting peace talks to resolve hot-spot issues, saying ""wars cannot solve problems and sanctions would only complicate them.""Wang made the remarks at a press conference in Ljubljana on Saturday after his meeting with Slovenia’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs, Tanja Fajon, China Daily reported.“China does not participate in or plan wars, and what China does is to encourage peace talks and promote political settlement of hotspot issues through dialogue,” Wang Yi said.The Chinese foreign minister also called for promoting multilateralism, strengthening multilateral mechanisms, and jointly safeguarding the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.He specified that the current international situation is marked by “intertwined chaos and continuous conflicts.”“China and Europe should be friends rather than rivals, and should cooperate rather than confront each other. Making the right choices amid the greatest changes in a century demonstrates the responsibilities that both sides should fulfill towards history and the people,” Wang Yi said, as reported by Global Times.His veiled reference came shortly after US President Donald Trump on Saturday proposed that Nato impose tariffs of 50 per cent to 100 per cent on China.“I believe that this, plus Nato, as a group, placing 50 per cent to 100 per cent TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip.”Trump’s renewed tariff threat came on the heels of his recent attempts to mediate and broker peace in the ongoing, intensifying war between Russia and Ukraine.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump shifted his focus to European allies. He signalled that he does not want European nations to continue buying oil from Russia and criticised their sanctions as ""not tough enough.""He said, ""Europe is buying oil from Russia. I don’t want them to buy oil -- and the sanctions that they’re putting on are not tough enough. I’m willing to do sanctions, but they’re going to have to toughen up their sanctions commensurate with what I’m doing.""Previously, Trump had accused Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping of “conspiring against” the United States. The accusation followed China’s largest-ever military parade held on September 3, which North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin attended.Hours after accusing Chinese President Xi Jinping of “conspiring against” America, Trump said his personal ties with the Chinese leadership were “very good.”Interestingly, this time, Trump left India out of his recent gambit, amid indications that Washington and New Delhi are working towards a separate deal.Earlier, Trump had also targeted India with his tariff rhetoric, already imposing a 50 per cent duty on New Delhi on similar grounds, accusing it of bolstering Russia through its “massive oil purchase"" from Moscow.","China has hit back strongly at Donald Trump-led US after Washington called on its Nato allies to impose major sanctions on Beijing.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

MCX Gold is currently consolidating near its all-time high of 140,465. With prices rebounding from the lower end of the range, the current level within the consolidation is seen as a buying opportunity. A breakout above the recent highs is likely to reignite the bullish momentum. As long as prices stay above the breakout zone, the overall outlook for Gold continues to be bullish.From a technical stance, the 134,000 zone stands out as a strong support, representing the breakout above the prior swing high. Any pullback toward this level is likely to encourage fresh buying interest, helping to limit near-term downside. Sustaining above this support reinforces the bullish structure and keeps the positive momentum firmly in place.Gold is well positioned to move toward the 144,000 level in the coming sessions.This potential advance aligns with the broader bullish trend and highlights the strength of the prevailing market momentum. Moreover, a clear and sustained breakout above the intermediate resistance of the consolidation range could draw in additional buying interest, further strengthening positive sentiment and paving the way for an extended upward move.Overall, Gold is firmly positioned to sustain its positive bias, with the broader technical structure strongly supporting trend continuation. As long as prices hold above the critical 134,000 support, the bullish setup remains intact. With momentum indicators and overall market sentiment continuing to stay supportive, the precious metal appears well poised for further upside in the coming sessions.MCX Silver has marked a fresh all-time high this week, with prices consistently forming higher highs over the past several months. Despite the recent pullback, the overall bias remains positive, and any declines toward the lower end of the weekly range are likely to present buying opportunities. We recommend trading in line with the existing trend, which remains firmly bullish.Silver’s rebound from the support level highlights renewed strength in the trend and increases the likelihood of further upside. As long as prices remain above the weekly support levels, the bullish bias is expected to stay intact. The immediate key support is placed near the 231,000 level, which now serves as a strong base. Any pullback toward this area is likely to attract fresh buying interest, helping to stabilize prices and sustain the upward momentum.On the upside, Silver is strongly positioned to challenge the 275,000 resistance over the near to medium term. This anticipated move marks a continuation of the prior bullish phase and is firmly supported by robust market momentum and favourable technical indicators. Overall, as long as prices remain comfortably above the 231,000 support, Silver is expected to sustain its positive trajectory, with ample scope for further upside as bullish sentiment continues to build.","Gold and silver prices are touching new record highs and this is a phase of consolidation, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Domestic equity benchmarks witnessed a sharp correction over the last four sessions, giving up the entirety of last week’s gains as relentless FII outflows continued. The sell-off was fueled by escalating global uncertainties, particularly speculation over possible US military action in Venezuela and evolving developments related to Greenland. Market sentiment weakened further following comments by the US President on India’s procurement of Russian oil, which raised apprehensions about potential tariff actions against India. These combined global and trade-related concerns led to heightened risk aversion across markets.The index on Thursday's session formed a sizable bearish candle with a lower high and a lower low, indicating an extension of the corrective decline for the fourth consecutive session. In the process, it also slipped below the rising trendline connecting recent swing lows and the 50-day EMA for the first time since 3 October 2025, highlighting a deterioration in short-term price structure.Looking ahead, sustained follow-through weakness could open further downside towards the 25,700–25,600 region.This zone represents a confluence of the previous month’s low and the 100-day EMA, making it an important medium-term support area.On the shorter-term horizon, momentum indicators suggest the market is in an oversold territory. Therefore, a technical pullback cannot be ruled out. However, for the corrective decline to pause, the index must close above the previous session’s high and decisively reclaim the 26,100 level. While key resistance remains at the 26,300 levels being the almost identical highs of the last two months.Bank Nifty continues to outperform the Nifty, displaying clear relative strength during the current week it has rallied to a fresh all-time high of 60437.Going forward, the index is expected to remain in a consolidation phase within the 59,500–60,400 range. A decisive breakout above this range or a breakdown below it will provide clarity on the next directional move.On the downside, immediate support is seen at 59,500, while the key short-term support zone lies at 59,000–58,700. This area is significant as it represents a confluence of the 50-day EMA and the previous month’s low, making it a crucial level to watch.The stock has generated a breakout above a falling trendline joining highs of the last 2 months signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.On the downside key support is placed at 2300-2250 levels being the presence of recent trendline support and key retracement of the recent up move.We expect the stock to head towards 2520 levels being the 61.8% retracement of the previous major decline (2667-2245).Tata Power continues to trade sideways on the daily timeframe, oscillating within a well-defined range of ₹370–₹410. The stock is currently forming a rectangle pattern, with consistent buying support emerging near the ₹370 zone.We expect the stock to rebound taking support at the lower band of the range of 370 and head higher towards the upper band of the range placed around 410 levels.On the lower side key support is placed at 355-350 levels being the key retracement of the recent up move.","Bajaj Broking Research's top stock picks for January 9, 2026 are Hindustan Unilever and Tata Power.

New Labour Codes explained: After rolling out our new labour codes in last November 2025, the government has now pre-published the draft rules, inviting public feedback within stipulated timelines up to February 14, 2026, and January 30, 2026 for the Industrial Relations Rules. The draft rules were published by the Ministry of Labour on December 31, 2025. They provide clarity on important issues that have implications for employees’ salary structure and organizations’ cost. The Ministry of Labour also released a list of FAQs on gratuity calculations and payout.These draft rules outline several key provisions that cover wage definitions, which are crucial for gratuity calculations, overtime payout criteria, rest days, contract labour conditions, grievance redressal mechanisms, compliance obligations for firms, need for appointment letters, employee benefits, standing orders across sectors and the creation of a worker re-skilling fund.According to EY, in response to the rules, organizations should do a comprehensive review across HR, finance, payroll and legal functions, supported by impact assessments and policy revisions, to align with the new labour law framework.The biggest clarification that comes from the release of the draft rules is on the definition of wages. The calculation of wages is important since this is what decides the gratuity amount received by individuals when leaving their jobs.According to the draft rules, wages cover:If the allowances and benefits together (except gratuity and retrenchment compensation) exceed 50% of the all remuneration, the excess amount shall be added back to wages. This added amount shall be treated as wages for statutory purposes. Leave encashment is not a part of allowances.As per the Code on Social Security, 2020, gratuity has to be calculated based on the rate of “wages” last drawn by the employee.The rules clarify that for the purpose of determination of gratuity, the exclusions from ‘wages’ shall also include any payment payable on an annual basis, that is linked to performance or productivity of an employee or of the establishment in which he/she is employed and is not part of the remuneration payable under the terms of employment.Additionally, the following shall not form part of the ‘wages’ –However, according to an EY analysis, the rules are yet to clarify if such components will be covered within the 50% limit on exclusions in the definition of ‘wages’.Gratuity shall be payable in following events:The calculation is simple: for every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months: 15 days’ wages per year (or such number as notified by Central Government) based on the rate of wages last drawn. The maximum gratuity is as notified by the central government which is currently Rs 20 lakh.Employees will be entitled to at least one ‘rest day’ per week. The employee shall not be required or allowed to work on the rest day unless they have a substituted rest day for a whole day on one of the working days in a week immediately before or after the rest day.No substitution can be made which will result in the employee working for more than ten days consecutively without a rest day for a whole day, the new rules say.A letter of appointment has to be issued to all employees in an establishment within 3 months of the new labour rules coming into force.Workers will be entitled to overtime pay, if certain work hour criteria are met. As per the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Rules, if a worker works for more than 8 hours in any day as daily wager in an organisation, or for more than 48 hours in any week, they shall be entitled to wages at the rate of twice his rate of wages for the extra time and shall be paid at the end of each wage period.Accordingly, ‘workers’ shall be entitled to overtime for working beyond 48 hours in a week (without any daily working hour limit for applicability of overtime).There are rules for employment of women in night shifts (i.e., after 7 PM and before 6 AM) – written consent of women employees is required and a pick and drop transport facility is mandatory.Every employer of a factory, dock, mine, building & other construction work has to ensure free of cost medical examination for every employee annually. This has to happen within 120 days from the commencement of the calendar year for those who have completed 40 years of age. An employer may avail facility for medical examination of the employee (s) under relevant rule of Social Security Code Rules, 2025 through Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC).The employer and negotiating union/council or majority of employees of the establishment (in the absence of negotiating union/ council) can enter into agreements for provision of creche facility in the establishment and if not provided, then for pay creche allowance, which shall not be less than Rs 500 per month per child.The employer has to pay a journey allowance to inter-state migrant workers once in 12 months for a to & fro journey from the place of employment to the place of residence.Any employer who retrenches a worker(s) has to transfer an amount equivalent to 15 days last drawn wages of such worker(s), within 10 days of such retrenchment, in an account to be maintained by the prescribed labour commissioner.The fund received from the employer can be electronically transferred by the labour commissioner to the account of the retrenched worker(s) within 45 days of retrenchment to enable the worker(s) to utilize the amount for re-skilling.Employment of contract labour in core activities of an establishment is not allowed, subject to exceptions. As per the OSHWC Rules, the Joint Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Labour & Employment (‘MoLE’) is empowered to pass an order on the question whether an activity classifies as a core activity or not.Other conditions with respect to engagement of contract labour include:Every industrial establishment that employs 20 or more workers has to set up a grievance redressal committee that will look to resolve disputes that arise out of individual grievances.The OSHWC Rules introduce a provision for setting up a separate grievance redressal mechanism for contract labour for redressal of grievances related to health, working conditions and wages. The grievances may be submitted at the level of the principal employer.In addition, every establishment employing 500 or more workers has to constitute a safety committee in the prescribed manner and shall consist of an equal number of members representing the employer and the workers, which shall not exceed 20.According to an EY analysis, while the rules pre-published by the government under labour codes have introduced some significant changes to promote ease of doing business and simplify compliance, it is essential for organizations to thoroughly assess the implications of these changes. It recommends the following points for organisations to take note of:","All remuneration whether by way of salaries, allowances or otherwise payable to a person employed. If the payments/allowances other than Basic pay, Dearness allowance and Retaining allowance exceed 50% then amount exceeding 50% will be added in the ‘Wages’ category.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126412786,imgsize-64302,width-400,resizemode-4/new-labour-codes.jpg"
Buying $200 bn worth of bonds! Trump’s new push to bring ‘mortgage rates down’ — How will it impact Americans?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/buying-200-bn-worth-of-bonds-trumps-new-push-to-bring-mortgage-rates-down-how-will-it-impact-americans/articleshow/126425624.cms,"What it make housing cheaper for Americans?



America and mortgage woes

US President Donald Trump has announced plans for the federal government to purchase $200 billion worth of mortgage bonds, saying the move will help bring down mortgage rates as concerns over housing affordability continue to weigh down Americans.In a post on social media on Thursday, Trump said the funds would come from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two mortgage giants that have been under government conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis. According to the US president, companies currently hold $200 billion in cash that will be used for the bond purchases.“This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN, monthly payments DOWN, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,” Trump wrote.The announcement comes as Trump and the White House seek to tackle affordability issues ahead of the November midterm elections. Home prices have continously outpaced income growth, largely due to a long-running shortage of new housing supply. That imbalance has made it harder for renters to step onto the property ladder and for existing homeowners to move up to larger homes, a problem that stretches back to Trump’s first term and the recovery from the housing market collapse that triggered the global financial crisis.White House officials did not immediately provide details on when or how the bond purchases would take place.The Federal Reserve has previously stepped in to buy mortgage-backed securities during periods of economic stress in an effort to push borrowing costs lower. Those interventions helped drive mortgage rates to historic lows, enabling many homeowners to refinance at rates of 3% or less. However, those same low rates have also discouraged homeowners from selling, limiting the number of homes available on the market.Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at real estate brokerage Redfin, questioned how effective the proposed move would be in addressing broader housing market constraints.“At a high level I feel this is putting a Band-Aid on a deeper issue and it probably wouldn’t lower rates enough to really undo the mortgage rate lock-in effect,” Fairweather told AP.She estimated that government purchases of mortgage debt could reduce rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage by around 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points. However, she cautioned that such a reduction would not tackle structural problems such as the chronic shortage of homes for sale, which continues to push prices higher and limit affordability.Mortgage rates are currently averaging about 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac. Thirty-year rates have not fallen below 6% since September 2022. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were placed into conservatorship in 2008 as the US economy slid into the Great Recession.“Lowering mortgage rates by maybe a quarter point or half a point maybe will encourage more demand on the margins, but I don’t think it’s going to solve the restrictions that exist in the housing market,” Fairweather added.The plan also carries risk, as it would draw down cash reserves that are intended to act as a buffer in the event of an economic downturn similar to the Great Recession. Using those reserves could leave Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac more exposed if the housing market were to weaken, effectively relying on the assumption that such a scenario is unlikely.Separately, the Federal Reserve continues to hold a substantial amount of mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet, roughly $2 trillion, down from $2.7 trillion in June 2022. The Fed began reducing its holdings as the US economy recovered from the pandemic.Mortgage rates surged as inflation accelerated after the pandemic, with the consumer price index reaching a four-decade high in 2022. While average mortgage rates have eased from nearly 7% at the start of Trump’s second term last year, the decline has done little to alleviate public anxiety over rising costs of housing, food and energy.Lower interest rates can reduce monthly mortgage payments and temporarily improve affordability, though home prices typically adjust over time. As of mid-2024, outstanding mortgage debt in the US stood at around $21.1 trillion, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.During the pandemic, many homeowners refinanced their loans at rates of 3% or lower, further contributing to the reluctance to sell.Trump has said broader housing reforms are on the way. Last month, he announced plans to unveil new measures, and on Wednesday he said he wants to prevent institutional investors from purchasing homes.","US President Donald Trump announced plans for the federal government to purchase $200 billion worth of mortgage bonds.

Trump tariff trial: What happens if US duties are struck down? Traders 'worried' for $150 billion refunds possibility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-tariff-trial-what-happens-if-us-duties-are-struck-down-traders-worried-for-150-billion-refunds-possibility/articleshow/126426102.cms,"Trump Clears Russia Sanctions Bill, 500% Tariff Threat Looms As India Reworks Oil Import Strategy

What tariff refunds are the stakeholders expecting?

'Not guaranteed a refund'

The ongoing Supreme Court trial on US President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose global tariffs has left companies, customs brokers and trade lawyers preparing for a potentially prolonged battle over refunds that could total close to $150 billion.The court is expected to issue rulings on Friday, though it has not specified which cases will be decided. The challenge revolces around Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, a statute historically used to sanction foreign adversaries or freeze assets, to levy tariffs, according to Reuters. Trump is the first US president to apply the law for this purpose.Scepticism among both conservative and liberal justices during November’s oral arguments has fuelled expectations that the tariffs may be struck down, with questions raised over whether IEEPA grants the authority to impose such duties.Between February 4 and December 14, tariffs imposed under the emergency law generated an estimated $133.5 billion in collections, based on US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data. Using average daily collections from late September to mid-December, Reuters estimated the total has since climbed towards $150 billion.Customs officials have made a recent technical change that has raised cautious optimism among importers.On January 2, CBP announced that tariff refunds would move entirely to electronic distribution through its ACE portal from February 6. While this stops short of a fully automated system, it suggests administrative readiness.“It does kind of signal that Customs is fully prepared to move forward with refunds, if the Supreme Court does, in fact, rule that way,” said Angela Lewis, global head of customs at logistics firm Flexport.CBP did not respond to questions on how it would handle an adverse ruling but said eliminating paper cheques would speed up payments and reduce fraud and errors. The US Treasury, which routinely processes hundreds of billions of dollars in tax refunds annually, also declined to comment on how tariff refunds would be managed.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the outcome of the case could be unclear but indicated that any loss of tariff revenue could be offset through other legal authorities. Speaking in Minneapolis, he said a ruling against Trump’s tariffs would mean “the president loses flexibility to use tariffs, both for national security, for negotiating leverage.”Trump introduced the IEEPA tariffs through two separate actions. In April, he announced “reciprocal” tariffs on imports from most US trading partners, citing a national emergency linked to trade deficits. Earlier, in February and March, tariffs were imposed on China, Canada and Mexico over fentanyl trafficking and illicit drugs, according to Reuters.Legal experts say the refund process will depend heavily on whether the Supreme Court provides explicit instructions or sends the issue back to a lower court, most likely the Court of International Trade. Under US rules, importers typically have 314 days to amend entries before they are “liquidated”, after which refunds are barred, a deadline that has already passed for some Chinese imports affected in February 2025.Despite the scale of potential repayments, companies fear that even a ruling against the tariffs will not automatically translate into refunds.“It's not in the government's DNA to give back money. And Trump would not want to give back money,” said Jim Estill, chief executive of Danby Appliances. The Canadian firm sells refrigerators, microwaves and laundry equipment through major US retailers, including Home Depot, and sources products from China and other Asian countries affected by the tariffs. Estill said Danby has paid about $7 million in duties and warned that recovering the money could trigger disputes further down the supply chain. “It's just going to be a dog's breakfast,” he said.To protect their positions, several companies have taken pre-emptive legal action against CBP. Costco said in court filings that even if the tariffs are ruled unlawful, importers “are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs” without judicial intervention. Similar lawsuits have been filed by Bumble Bee Foods, Revlon, EssilorLuxottica, Kawasaki Motors and Yokohama Tire, Reuters reported.Some smaller businesses are opting out of the wait entirely, selling their refund claims to hedge funds at steep discounts in a fast-growing secondary market. Toymaker Kids2 said it received 23 cents on the dollar for reciprocal tariffs and just nine cents for those tied to fentanyl-related duties.Jay Foreman, chief executive of Basic Fun!, which sells Tonka trucks, Care Bears and K’Nex toys, said he doubts the company will recover the $6 million it paid in tariffs ahead of the Christmas sales season. He expects the administration to “obfuscate or delay” payments even if refunds are ordered. While he has not sold the claim, he said he would consider it if it meant faster repayment.“The last thing the American public wants to know is a bunch of slick Wall Street or predatory-lender types will come and make a fortune off all this,” Foreman said.Advisers are urging companies to act quickly and keep detailed documentation. Pete Mento, a trade advisory director at Baker Tilly, said firms will likely need to demonstrate they paid IEEPA-based duties before any refund is issued. “The people that get their claims in early and have them done correctly are the ones who are going to reap the benefits the fastest,” he said. “And, knowing the way the processes work in Washington, it could be years before you see that money. ”","Supreme Court trial on US President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose global tariffs has left companies, customs brokers and trade lawyers preparing for a potentially prolonged battle.

Stock market today: Indian equity benchmarks, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , ended sharply lower on Friday, extending their recent decline, as selling pressure weighed across sectors. The BSE Sensex tumbled 604.72 points to settle at 83,576.24, while the Nifty50 fell 193.55 points to close at 25,683.30.Analysts believe that Indian equities are likely to face continued pressure in the near term as investors remain wary of potential tariff actions by the Donald Trump administration, persistent geopolitical risks and subdued cues from global markets.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “After the sharp correction yesterday triggered by the possibility of about 500 % tariff on India under the provisions of the Russia Sanctioning Act approved by President Trump, the market will be focused on the verdict expected today from the US Supreme Court on the legality of Trump tariffs. There is a high probability of the verdict going against Trump. But the details are significant: that is, whether it would be a partial striking down of the tariffs or completely declaring the tariffs illegal. The market reaction would depend on the details.

The Resilience Gap: Why Household Security Matters Now

(First Revised Estimate)

India’s Impending Challenge: Ageing with Dignity

From Reform to Execution: Making Policy Work for Households

(Sumit Madan is Managing Director and CEO, Axis Max Life Insurance)

The Union Budget 2026 arrives at a defining juncture of India’s ascent, where progress must be measured not merely by the velocity of our growth, but by the resilience of the nation’s foundation. Over the past few decades, India has undergone a historic transformation, scaling from a $1 trillion economy to a global powerhouse through massive, sustained investments in physical and digital infrastructure. Yet, as the nation targets the $5 trillion milestone and beyond, we must recognize that swift economic expansion without robust household financial security is inherently fragile. As India enters this next chapter of growth, life insurance must be positioned as a national priority and a strategic pillar that transforms prosperity into permanence and shields the aspirations of a billion-plus people from the headwinds of uncertainty.For a ""Viksit Bharat"" to endure, national success must be measured by the financial resilience of Indian families. However, recent data signals a dual vulnerability where according to the Economic Survey 2024-25, India’s gross domestic savings as a percentage of GDP fell from 31.2% in 2021-22 to 30.2% in 2022-23. This decline in savings is mirrored by a stagnation in financial protection, leaving households exposed.This downward shift is more than just a statistic, and signals an impending vulnerability in the nation's financial foundation. To address this, the Union Budget 2026 must serve as a critical demand-side engine to rebuild this foundation through a two-pronged fiscal strategy. First, to bolster overall household savings, a comprehensive overhaul of Sections 80C, 80CCC, and 80CCD is required, featuring higher, inflation-indexed limits.As it stands, India’s total sum assured as a percentage of GDP stands at just 24%, a stark contrast to Singapore (332%) or Malaysia (153%). Consequently, India’s protection gap remains the highest in the region at 83%, compared to just 55% in Singapore.Hence, to specifically bridge this protection gap, the government should introduce a dedicated tax deduction for pure term insurance premiums, independent of the current ₹1.5 lakh limit of Section 80C. By establishing an exclusive incentive similar to Section 80D’s treatment of health insurance, the Budget can elevate life protection from a discretionary expense to a fundamental pillar of financial planning, ensuring a secure household base for a developed India.Despite rising disposable incomes, a significant share of Indian households, especially those dependent on a single breadwinner, remains one income shock or medical emergency away from financial distress. The need for reform is made more urgent by a looming demographic shift: India is set to age faster than it grows rich. By 2050, one in five Indians will be over the age of 60, yet retirement preparedness continues to lag behind aspiration.Addressing India's impending demographic and financial challenges requires moving beyond fragmented, legacy frameworks. The Union Budget 2026 should create a dedicated tax bucket for annuities and pension products, recognizing retirement planning as a non-negotiable social necessity. Crucially, this reform must create parity with the National Pension System (NPS), ensuring that all pension-linked instruments benefit from a level playing field to encourage long-term disciplined saving.Central to this overhaul should be the inclusion of annuities under Section 10(10D) as tax-exempt instruments. Currently, Section 10(10D) explicitly excludes retirement payouts, treating annuity income as taxable at the individual’s slab rate, which creates a significant deterrent to retirement security. Granting tax-free status to these payouts will ensure protection remains meaningful in an evolving economy. By aligning the annuity tax treatment, India’s financial architecture can evolve into a credible social security platform, shifting life insurance from a discretionary purchase to an essential safety net.To deliver these targeted solutions at scale, the regulatory framework must undergo a commensurate evolution. The government’s recognition of life insurance as an essential service under the GST framework is a progressive measure that serves as a vital precursor to the sector's overarching reform. This fiscal alignment effectively anchors the Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha Bill 2025, which has already established the strategic direction for universal coverage. To translate this vision into impact, the upcoming Union Budget 2026 must now provide a concrete execution roadmap, formalizing the transition toward 100% FDI while ensuring robust governance remains paramount.Furthermore, there is significant anticipation for a clear roadmap regarding Composite Licensing. By enabling a ""one-stop-shop"" model integrating life and health insurance, the industry can lower distribution costs and simplify the consumer journey, fostering a more holistic protection ecosystem for all Indians.Today, it is time to recognize life insurance as a vital fiscal stabilizer, with the Union Budget 2026 representing an opportunity to institutionalize financial security as a national priority. Together, policymakers and the industry can ensure that by 2047, every Indian household stands protected.","Sumit Madan: For a ""Viksit Bharat"" to endure, national success must be measured by the financial resilience of Indian families.

BENGALURU: India’s deeptech funding rose in 2025 even as investor risk appetite tightened, with capital flowing to fewer companies, at later stages, and in larger cheque sizes. The shift lifted overall funding levels despite a sharp fall in the number of deals, highlighting a move towards selectivity and concentration rather than a broad-based return of earlystage risk capital, according to data from Tracxn.Total deeptech funding climbed to $1.6 billion in 2025, up from $1.2 billion in 2024 and $1.1 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, the number of funding rounds fell to 274, compared with 393 in 2024 and 350 in 2023, marking the lowest deal count in 5 years.Deal concentration was most pronounced at the top end. The 5 largest deeptech rounds accounted for a significant share of total capital, led by logistics-focused clean transport platform GreenLine and conversational AI firm Uniphore, which together raised over $500 million.They were followed by defence and aerospace startup Raphe, legal technology company Spotdraft, and spacetech firm Digantara.The mix of sectors—clean transport, AI, defence, enterprise software, and spacetech—underscores how funding clustered around a small set of scaled or scaling companies, rather than being spread across early-stage experimentation.Stage-wise trends show a clear recalibration of risk.Early-stage funding rose sharply to $971.9 million in 2025, the highest level tracked by Tracxn, while late-stage funding recovered to $345.5 million after a weak 2023. Seed-stage funding, however, declined to $268.8 million from $302 million in 2024, reflecting tighter screening at entry level.","Total deeptech funding climbed to $1.6 billion in 2025.

CHENNAI: The Indian tractor industry closed 2025 on a high note, with annual domestic volumes crossing the one-million-unit mark for the first time in its history. Exports also rebounded strongly, crossing the onelakh-unit milestone after a two-year gap.Total domestic tractor sales touched 10.9 lakh units in 2025, compared with 9.1 lakh units in 2024, posting strong double-digit growth of 20%, according to data from the Tractor & Mechanisation Association (TMA).A combination of factors helped the industry sustain strong momentum, with major contributors being favourable agricultural conditions and a cut in the GST rate on tractors.Rating agency ICRA noted that the 2025 southwest monsoon season concluded with rainfall at 108% of the long-period average, providing a generally favourable base for the farm economy. While rainfall distribution was uneven, overall adequate precipitation supported crop sowing and yield expectations, contributing to healthier farm cash flows and positive rural sentiment.In addition, the reduction of the GST rate to 5%, effective Oct, led to a decline in tractor prices, with savings ranging from about Rs 40,000 to Rs 1,00,000 across different horsepower segments, making new tractors more affordable, it added.

Cigarette tax hike: Experts warn of surge in illicit trade; fear major revenue losses for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cigarette-tax-hike-experts-warn-of-surge-in-illicit-trade-fear-major-revenue-losses-for-government/articleshow/126334324.cms,"Representative image

A sharp increase in taxes on cigarettes, along with a new excise duty structure on tobacco products, could trigger a surge in illicit trade and lead to significant revenue losses for the government, experts have warned.Earlier this week, the finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks, depending on their length.The new excise duty, which comes into effect from February 1, will be levied in addition to the existing 40 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ).This change implies an overall tax hike of around 60–70 per cent, varying by cigarette length, compared with the current overall tax incidence of about 50–55 per cent.The move marks a transition from the GST compensation cess to an excise-based regime for demerit goods.The unexpected nature of the tax increase has raised concerns about higher smuggling and illegal trade in tobacco products.According to news agency PTI, Ranganath Tannir, secretary general of Think Change Forum, said the steep rise could prove counterproductive. “Public finance theory is clear that excessive taxation of inelastic goods fuels illicit trade, not compliance,” he said, adding that cigarettes in India are already among the least affordable globally based on World Health Organization affordability indicators.Making them more expensive is unlikely to curb demand, but could push consumers towards illegal and smuggled products, undermining tax collections, he noted.Brokerage reports have echoed similar concerns. According to JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research, a higher tax rate for the King Size Filter Tip (KSFT) segment increases the risk of consumers downtrading to cheaper options and may also lead to higher consumption of illicit cigarettes.Illicit tobacco already accounts for about 26 per cent of India’s total tobacco market, making the country the fourth-largest market globally for smuggled tobacco, PTI reported.Nomura, in its research note, said that while higher taxes are aimed at reducing consumption, they often have unintended consequences. “High taxes on cigarettes… fuel the growth of illicit cigarettes and push consumers towards cheaper, non-tax paid smuggled cigarettes,” the brokerage said.Jefferies, citing a report by the Tobacco Institute of India (TII), said the industry body has urged the government to review the proposed excise structure.A wider gap between legal and illegal prices could benefit non-duty-paid cigarettes and result in higher tax leakage, the report noted.Experts also pointed to international experience to underline the risks. Australia’s repeated tobacco tax hikes between 2012 and 2020 led to a sharp rise in cigarette prices and were followed by a jump in illicit tobacco consumption from under 2 per cent to around 14 per cent of the market.Calling the proposed excise levies “unprecedented”, an analyst said there is still time to reassess the decision before it comes into force.“Since they take effect from February 1, 2026, the government has an opportunity to revisit and rectify them before they spawn a much larger problem of uncontrollable illicit networks,” the analyst warned, as per PTI.","The finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks.

While Trump presented the country as newly secure and open for business, industry leaders responded cautiously, with one major executive saying Venezuela remains “uninvestable” without deep reforms.Speaking at the White House, Trump said his administration would take charge of deciding which companies are allowed to operate in Venezuela, sidelining Caracas from the process. He argued that foreign firms had previously operated without adequate protections under Maduro and claimed the situation had now fundamentally changed.“We're going to be making the decision as to which oil companies are going to go in... (we're) going to cut a deal with the companies,” Trump said. “But now you have total security. It's a whole different Venezuela.”Trump added that oil companies would “deal with us directly,” signalling that Washington would manage access to Venezuela’s oil resources and exclude the country itself from negotiations.However, ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods raised serious doubts about returning to the country, citing the company’s history of asset seizures.“We've had our assets seized there twice and so, you can imagine, to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes,” Woods said. “If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela -- today, it's uninvestable.”The meeting came days after US forces seized Maduro, an action Trump has openly linked to Venezuela’s oil wealth. He said discussions with executives would centre on rapidly restoring the country’s deteriorated oil infrastructure and increasing output by millions of barrels per day.Those attending included Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, along with executives from Chevron, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Halliburton, Valero, Marathon, Shell, Trafigura, Vitol Americas and Repsol.A ConocoPhillips spokesman said chief executive Ryan Lance valued the talks around “preparing Venezuela to be investment ready.”After the meeting, Trump said participants had “sort of formed a deal,” though he did not provide details. He claimed companies were ready to invest “at least 100 Billion Dollars” in the country.Analysts told AFP that the plan to revive Venezuela’s oil industry faces major obstacles. They said the size of the country’s reserves does not guarantee quick or profitable production, pointing to ageing infrastructure, political risks, costly heavy crude extraction and growing investor caution as the world moves away from fossil fuels.“There's lots of talk about the size of the reserves -- 300 billion barrels of proved reserves -- but what's often missing from the conversation is how realistic it is for those to be economically extracted,” said Rich Collett-White, an energy analyst at Carbon Tracker.Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who has previously said the US would control Venezuela’s oil industry “indefinitely,” acknowledged after the talks that rebuilding the sector would “take time.”Meanwhile, Venezuela’s interim President Delcy Rodriguez said her government remained in control of the country, while the state oil company said it was holding negotiations with Washington.Chevron is currently the only US firm licensed to operate in Venezuela. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips exited the country in 2007 after rejecting demands from then-president Hugo Chavez to give the state majority control.Trump also said in a social media post that he had cancelled a second round of strikes on Venezuela, citing what he described as “cooperation” from the country.Venezuela has been under US sanctions since 2019 and holds around one-fifth of the world’s oil reserves. Despite this, it accounted for only about one percent of global crude production in 2024, according to OPEC, after years of underinvestment, sanctions and embargoes.Trump sees Venezuela’s oil wealth as a potential boost to his efforts to further bring down fuel prices in the United States.",US President Donald Trump held talks with senior oil executives on Friday.

'PM Modi-Trump Held 8 Calls In 2025': India Rejects Lutnick's Claim On Stalled Trade Agreement

The Supreme Court will not rule in the crucial case of US President Donald Trump's tariffs case on Friday. The ruling is being watched globally for its implications on all major economies. Earlier it was expected that the apex court would rule on the important issue on Friday.At the centre of the case is the legality of the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs and whether the US president has the authority to impose them under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law that grants special powers during national emergencies. Back in 2025, lower courts had ruled that the tariffs were implemented illegally, however, allowed the import taxes to remain in force while the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court.The justices heard arguments in the case on November 5, during which both conservative and liberal members of the court expressed scepticism about whether the law gave the president unilateral authority to levy such broad duties. The ruling, issued after weeks of deliberation, now provides clarity on the scope of presidential power under IEEPA and the future of the tariffs imposed using it.The decision carries major financial implications. Companies have paid an estimated $133.5 billion in IEEPA-based tariffs through December 14, according to government data, with the total now believed to be closer to $150 billion, as estimated by Reuters.Hundreds of companies have taken legal action, filing lawsuits in the US Court of International Trade seeking to have the tariffs they paid declared unlawful and demanding refunds.More than 900 lawsuits have been filed on behalf of companies seeking tariff refunds, collectively naming over 1,000 plaintiffs, according to a tally compiled by Bloomberg. The list includes major brands such as Costco, Reebok, Peloton, Dole, Revlon and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, alongside firms including Kawasaki Motors, EssilorLuxottica, Bumble Bee Foods, Schick Manufacturing, Playtex, Spencer Gifts, PopSockets, Conair, Xerox, Dooney & Bourke, Barnes & Nobles, PUMA, Lane Bryant, Steve Madden, Bath & Body Works, Bose, TOMS Shoes, e.l.f.

US markets today: Wall Street edges higher after mixed jobs data; rate-cut bets pushed back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-markets-today-wall-street-edges-higher-after-mixed-jobs-data-rate-cut-bets-pushed-back/articleshow/126438450.cms,"US stock markets traded slightly higher on Friday after a mixed US jobs report tempered expectations of an early interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, without fully closing the door on easing later this year, according to an AP report.In early trading, the S&P 500 rose 0.2% and hovered near its all-time high set earlier in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 147 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite was largely flat.Treasury yields moved in different directions after the Labor Department said employers hired fewer workers in December than economists had expected, even as the unemployment rate improved and came in better than forecasts. The data reinforced the view that the US labour market may be in a “low-hire, low-fire” phase.The improvement in unemployment prompted traders to scale back expectations of a rate cut at the Fed’s next policy meeting later this month. Markets are now pricing in just a 5% chance of a rate cut, down from 11% a day earlier, according to CME Group data. However, traders continue to expect at least two rate cuts later in the year.“Until the data provide a clearer direction, a divided Fed is likely to stay that way,” Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said. “Lower rates are likely coming this year, but the markets may have to be patient.”After the report, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury was steady at 4.19%, while the two-year Treasury yield edged up to 3.50% from 3.49%, reflecting shifting expectations for near-term Fed policy.On the corporate front, Vistra surged 14.6% after signing a 20-year agreement to supply electricity to Meta Platforms from three nuclear plants, highlighting rising power demand from data centres supporting artificial intelligence.

US Issues Blunt Warning To Indian Students: Breaking Laws May Cost Visas, Careers And Future Dreams

Hiring in the United States remained subdued in December, capping a year of weak employment gains, even as the unemployment rate edged lower, according to data released by the US Labor Department on Friday, AP reported.Employers added 50,000 jobs in December, nearly unchanged from a downwardly revised 56,000 jobs added in November. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.4 per cent from 4.5 per cent in November, marking its first decline since June, the data showed.The figures indicate that businesses remain cautious about expanding their workforces despite an improvement in overall economic growth. Many firms hired aggressively in the post-pandemic phase and now appear reluctant to add more workers, while others are holding back amid uncertainty linked to shifting US tariff policies, elevated inflation and the growing impact of artificial intelligence on jobs.The December report is being closely watched as it offers the first clear reading on the labour market in three months. The government did not release employment data in October due to a six-week shutdown, while November figures were distorted by the same disruption.December’s numbers also close out a year marked by slowing job creation. The economy generated an average of 111,000 jobs a month in the first three months of 2025, but that pace dropped sharply to just 11,000 a month in the three months ended August, before a modest rebound to 22,000 jobs in November.Economists note that weak hiring has emerged as a key puzzle for the US economy, which has continued to grow at a healthy pace. Growth reached an annualised 4.3 per cent in the July–September quarter last year, even as job gains softened and unemployment ticked higher through much of the year.With hiring losing momentum, the US Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate three times late last year to support borrowing, spending and employment. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signalled that policymakers may hold rates steady in the coming months while assessing how the economy evolves.Despite low layoffs and a stable unemployment rate, economists remain divided on the outlook. Some expect hiring to pick up if growth remains strong, while others caution that automation and artificial intelligence could allow the economy to expand without a corresponding rise in jobs.","Hiring in the United States remained subdued in December, capping a year of weak employment gains.

Budget office expects Federal Reserve to cut rates in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/budget-office-expects-federal-reserve-to-cut-rates-in-2026/articleshow/126425466.cms,"The Federal Reserve is expected to cut short-term rates in 2026, with its key interest rate settling at 3.4% towards the end of President Donald Trump 's term in office in 2028, according to a new report released Thursday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Despite the Fed's cuts, however, the budget office projects the yield on 10-year Treasury notes to increase gradually, from 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2025 to 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2028. The 10-year Treasury yield is a benchmark for mortgage rates, so the forecast suggests mortgage borrowing could get more expensive over the next two years.The CBO on Thursday released new economic projections for the next three years, taking into account Trump's tariffs, immigration policies and last year's federal government shutdown, among other factors.""Together, those adjustments affected the near-term path of GDP, employment, and inflation but did not materially change the overall economic outlook through 2028,"" the report states.Jobless rates are expected to increase before they improve over the next two years, the report states.The CBO expects the unemployment rate to peak at 4.6% in 2026 but then ease to 4.4% in 2028 - affected largely by the impacts of Trump's tax and spending law, passed by Congress and signed in July, as well as fewer migrants in the country.Also, the budget office projects that real gross domestic product growth is expected to rise to 2.2% in 2026, supported by the tax and spending law and a rebound from the late-2025 shutdown. GDP growth is then set to slow to an average of 1.8% in 2027 and 2028 as fiscal support wanes and labor force growth slows. The forecasts are similar to those made by the Federal Reserve, though the Fed expects growth will reach 2% in 2027 and 1.9% in 2028.Last September, when the CBO released an updated three-year outlook, it issued the same projection for GDP growth for the next three years.Inflation is expected remain above the Fed's 2% target in the near term, the CBO says, due to tariffs and stronger demand, gradually falling to 2.1% in 2028.On Wednesday, the CBO released data that predicts the U.S. population is projected to grow by 15 million people in 30 years, a smaller estimate than in previous years, due to Trump's hardline immigration policies and an expected lower fertility rate.Lawmakers established the Congressional Budget Office more than 50 years ago to provide objective, impartial analysis to support the budget process.","The Congressional Budget Office released new economic projections for the next three years, taking into account Trump's tariffs, immigration policies and last year's federal government shutdown.

500% Tariff Shock? Trump Okays 'Graham-Blumenthal Bill', Clashes With China Amid Tensions

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's approval to a new bill that allows for up to 500% tariff on countries importing Russian petroleum is a threat not just for China and India, but even others, such as the European Union, which have opposed Moscow's offensive against Ukraine but have been buying energy.An analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) has estimated that since the Ukraine conflict began in Feb 2022, Russia earned 1,002 billion euros (around $1.2 trillion at current exchange rate) from fossil fuel exports, with oil's share being 68% and the rest being gas (over 20%) and coal (over 10%).While China was the largest importer of Russian oil, with purchases exceeding 210 billion euros (around $245 billion) until Monday, India was second - spending $168 billion, followed by EU $125 billion (see graph).China's cumulative spend on Russian fossil fuels was estimated at nearly 294 billion euros ($343 billion), while India spent over 162 billion euros ($190 billion) on oil and coal. According to CREA's monthly analysis of Russian fossil fuel exports and sanctions, China's crude oil imports fell to 3.1 billion euros in Nov from 3.7 billion euros in Oct, while India's imports rose marginally to 2.6 billion euros in Nov from 2.5 billion euros in Oct.Now, all eyes are on what Trump does next. Many see the US action as fresh pressure to get Russia on the negotiating table and agree to the terms being pushed by him.Energy policy and geopolitics expert Narendra Taneja said the new US bill has only been passed by the US Congress and does not necessarily mean it will be implemented by the administration. ""We should wait and watch,"" Taneja said.So far, India has focused on its commercial interests while making purchases, including from Russia whose share in the Indian oil basket has reduced but it remains the biggest source for crude. With Lukoil and Rosneft facing sanctions, Indian purchases from Russia are expected to moderate.","China was the largest importer of Russian oil, with purchases exceeding 210 billion euros (around $245 billion) until Monday.

A year ago, the rate stood significantly higher at 6.93%, Freddie Mac said.Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, often favoured by homeowners refinancing their loans, also moved up marginally to 5.46% from 5.44% a week earlier. The rate averaged 6.14% during the same period last year.Mortgage rates are shaped by a range of factors, including Federal Reserve policy signals, inflation expectations and movements in the bond market. They tend to track the 10-year US Treasury yield, which was at 4.17% around midday on Thursday.Rates have largely stabilised in recent weeks after easing from late October, when the 30-year mortgage rate dipped to 6.17%, then its lowest level in over a year. The decline followed expectations of US Federal Reserve rate cuts, which began in September and continued last month.Although the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its interest rate decisions can influence investor behaviour. Rate cuts often signal slowing growth or easing inflation, prompting demand for US government bonds and pushing down long-term yields, which in turn can lower mortgage rates.Overall, the average 30-year mortgage rate ended last year nearly a percentage point lower than at the start of 2025, helping improve purchasing power for some buyers toward the end of the year. Sales of previously owned US homes rose month-on-month in September, October and November.However, November sales were lower than a year earlier — the first such decline since May — and the market is on track to finish the year below 2024 levels. Data on December existing home sales are due next week.Lower mortgage rates have offered some relief to buyers who can afford current prices. The median monthly US housing payment fell to $2,365 in the four weeks ended January 4, down 4.7% from a year earlier, according to Redfin.Despite this, housing affordability remains a major hurdle, especially for first-time buyers, due to years of rising home prices and modest wage growth. Economic and job market uncertainty has also kept many potential buyers on the sidelines.Economists broadly expect the average 30-year mortgage rate to hover slightly above 6% through the year, suggesting borrowing costs are unlikely to fall sharply in the near term.","The average long-term mortgage rate rose to 6.16% this week from 6.15% last week.

Global AI race: DeepSeek gains ground in developing nations; Microsoft flags widening gap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-ai-race-deepseek-gains-ground-in-developing-nations-microsoft-flags-widening-gap/articleshow/126419279.cms,"Photo credit- AP

Chinese AI startup DeepSeek is seeing rapid adoption across several developing countries, helping broaden access to generative artificial intelligence even as the overall gap between advanced and emerging economies continues to widen, according to a new Microsoft report.The report said global adoption of generative AI tools reached 16.3% of the world’s population in the three months to December, up from 15.1% in the preceding quarter, AP reported. However, AI adoption in developed economies — described by Microsoft as the “global north” — is growing at nearly twice the pace of adoption in developing countries.“We are seeing a divide and we are concerned that that divide will continue to widen,” Juan Lavista Ferres, chief data scientist at Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab, said. The analysis is based on anonymised telemetry data tracking global device usage.Countries that invested early in digital infrastructure and artificial intelligence continue to lead adoption levels, including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, France and Spain. The findings broadly align with earlier surveys, including research by the Pew Research Center, which showed higher enthusiasm for AI in countries such as South Korea.Against this backdrop, the rise of DeepSeek — founded in 2023 — has played a significant role in expanding AI use across parts of the developing world. Microsoft researchers said DeepSeek’s free-to-use and “open source” models have lowered barriers to adoption, particularly in price-sensitive regions.When DeepSeek released its advanced reasoning model R1 in January 2025, claiming it was more cost-effective than comparable offerings from OpenAI, it drew attention across the global technology industry. Research co-authored by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng and published in Nature later that year described the work as a “landmark paper”.Lavista Ferres said DeepSeek performs well on tasks such as mathematics and coding, but noted that it operates differently from US-based models on politically sensitive topics. “For certain type of questions, of course, they follow the same type of access to the internet that China has,” he said, adding that responses on political issues can differ significantly.DeepSeek offers a free chatbot across web and mobile platforms and allows developers to modify and build on its core engine. According to the report, the absence of subscription fees has “lowered the barrier for millions of users, especially in price-sensitive regions”.The report found that DeepSeek’s adoption remained limited in North America and Europe, where several governments have raised security concerns. Countries including the US, Germany and Australia have sought to restrict its use, and Microsoft last year banned its own employees from using the platform.By contrast, DeepSeek’s usage surged in China and in countries such as Russia, Iran, Cuba and Belarus — regions where access to US-based technology platforms is restricted. In many markets, its adoption was linked to being pre-installed or promoted on smartphones from Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei.DeepSeek’s estimated market share was about 89% in China, followed by Belarus at 56% and Cuba at 49%. In Russia, its share was around 43%, while in Iran and Syria it ranged between 23% and 25%. In several African countries, including Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Niger, its market share stood between 11% and 14%.“Open-source AI can function as a geopolitical instrument, extending Chinese influence in areas where Western platforms cannot easily operate,” the report said.","Global adoption of generative AI tools reached 16.3% of the world’s population in the three months to December, up from 15.1% in the preceding quarter.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

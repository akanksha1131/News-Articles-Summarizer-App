Gold Price Outlook

Gold Weekly View: Sideways

Trading Range: Rs. 96,200 – 99,150 / 10 gm. CMP (Rs. 97,930 / 10 gm.)

Meanwhile Silver has good potential to outperform Gold in long term perspective, driven by stronger fundamentals as the market enters its 5th consecutive year of structural deficit. However on a short term basis prices might turn volatile edging down after the strong rally seen last week only to provide fresh buying opportunities.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates have continued to be relatively range-bound after hitting record highs three months ago. US President Donald Trump’s tariff war continues, adding to global uncertainty, yet experts are of the view that trade deals are likely to be finalized in the coming weeks. Silver is expected to continue its bull run in the coming months, and may outperform gold in the long-term.Gold started the week slightly on a positive note after a marginal increase of 0.6% seen last week. US trading partners continued to navigate the final weeks of negotiations as Trump’s patience with talks appeared to wear thin. Rising trade tensions underscored gold’s haven appeal, although investors grew increasingly less convinced about the likelihood of widespread upheaval as a trade truce looked likely before the August 1 deadline.The yellow metal had surged by more than a quarter this year, hitting a record above $3,500 an ounce in April, as the US’s aggressive and erratic trade policy enhanced its appeal as a store of value in uncertain times.However, the rally has stalled over the last three months as investors wait for more clarity on the eventual contours of the new trade system, and on signs they’re hesitant to buy gold at such elevated levels.Meanwhile Silver rose to the highest in almost 14 years as investors sought alternatives to a near-record gold price, with increased demand leading to tighter physical supply.Spot silver continued to rise 1.8%, following last week’s 4% increase. The implied cost of borrowing the precious metal for one month spiked to above 6%, compared with its typical rate of nearly zero. The rise in appetite for the metal left the physical market under strain in London, where most silver is held by exchange-traded funds meaning it is not available to lend or buy.Renewed trade tensions have helped Silver to surge dramatically, hitting $39.57 on COMEX marking the highest level since the 2011 peak of $50 and setting a new lifetime high of ₹ 1,15,136 /Kg. in the domestic MCX futures market. The bullish breakout on the technical front, anticipated after it broke above 1 lakh mark in June, followed renewed tariff tensions between the US and its major trading partners.Investors could closely watch key US economic reports due later in the session & in this week, including CPI, PPI, industrial production, & retail sales for clearer signals on the Federal Reserve’s next policy decision.The cautious stance of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) might cap any sharp upside for the yellow metal as the US central bank is widely anticipated to hold interest rates steady in July meeting. Also tariff developments & further negotiations from Euro Zone & other trading partners could keep the movement in Gold sideways as of now.","Naveen Mathur, Director - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers shares his views and recommendations for gold and silver investors.

Top stock market recommendations:Nifty traded broadly within its previous day’s range, recovering its early morning losses to end with minor gains ahead of its weekly expiry due today. With downside targets seeming to be complete and fresh upside opens up only above 25325 closing, any 50-70 point dip is likely to get bought into for targets of 25320 odd for this week’s trade.Bank Nifty continuing its outperformance ended at a 5 day closing highs as its supports of 56750 got protected not once, but twice at the start of this week. With continuing outperformance against Nifty, Bank Nifty is now back on track to scale to fresh all time highs, unless a close below 56750 negates this formation on daily charts.Ending at a 6 month closing highs earlier this week, Hero Motocorp has given a breakout from its bullish cup and handle pattern along with a crossover from its 200 DMA.This breakout also marks an end to the 8 week long consolidation seen on daily charts as the stock has shown signs of moving further northward given the price action positioned in a similar stance for a target of 5000 for now.After holding above its 200 DMA all through the past week, the Tata Power stock has moved forward to breakout from its 6 month long cup and handle formation on daily and weekly charts ahead of its quarterly numbers. This is accompanied by a higher low formation on daily charts repeated over 5 times in the past 3-4 months signalling presences of buyers at lower levels.After a strong rally of 110% from its Feb 2025 lows to June 2025 highs, Solar Industries India has started showing profit taking as focus shifts from defence as a sector. Charts suggest that over 40-50% of this recent rally is likely to be retraced, however we are looking for targets of 13700-800 zone which also coincides with its previous breakout and consolidation zone. Stock has already corrected ~15% off recent highs in less than 3 weeks.","Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, says Hero Motocorp, Tata Power are the top buy calls for today.

US President Donald Trump called on Republicans to extend their full support to the GENIUS Act, a sweeping bill aimed at regulating stablecoins and asserting America’s dominance in the digital asset space.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote, “HAPPY CRYPTO WEEK! The House will soon VOTE on a tremendous Bill to Make America the UNDISPUTED, NUMBER ONE LEADER in Digital Assets - Nobody does it better! The GENIUS Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe, and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can’t do it.”“Digital Assets are the FUTURE, and we are leading by a lot! Get the first Vote done this afternoon (ALL REPUBLICANS SHOULD VOTE YES!). This is our moment - Digital Assets, GENIUS, Clarity! It is all part of Making America Great Again, BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE.”The US President said America is leading the world and will continue working with the Senate and House to push through more related legislation.Earlier, Trump wrote that he had met with 11 of the 12 lawmakers needed to pass the GENIUS Act, and after a brief discussion, all had agreed to vote in favour of the Rule the following morning.Describing the bill as a cornerstone of his MAGA agenda, he said, “Speaker of the House Mike Johnson was at the meeting via telephone, and looks forward to taking the Vote as early as possible. I want to thank the Congressmen/women for their quick and positive response. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”The GENIUS Act is a proposed law that aims to introduce the first-ever federal framework to regulate stablecoins, cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to assets like the US dollar.The bill is designed to bring clarity and oversight to the rapidly growing digital asset market. Supporters say it balances the need for consumer protection with the push for financial innovation, despite ongoing political debates and concerns around transparency.Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are used widely for digital payments, cross-border transfers, and decentralised finance (DeFi). The market for stablecoins has ballooned to nearly $250 billion, raising concerns about financial stability and the lack of regulation.The legislation sets out rules on how stablecoins are issued, the kind of reserves required to back them, and how transparent issuers need to be. It introduces federal oversight to close legal gaps and prevent misuse by bad actors. Supporters believe the bill brings long-needed clarity and safeguards to an industry that has largely operated without clear laws.",US President Donald Trump called on Republicans to extend their full support to the GENIUS Act.

Gold and silver price prediction today: Will gold prices hit the Rs 1 lakh mark anytime soon? Experts are of the view that amidst ongoing global economic uncertainty due to Donald Trump’s tariff war, gold as a safe haven asset is in focus. Silver prices too have seen a significant rally.Prices have broken the strong ₹96,500 resistance zone, triggering a short-term bullish bias in MCX gold. Technicals suggest immediate upside targets near ₹98,500 and possibly further higher toward ₹99,800 if momentum picks up.Several technical indicators reinforce this positive near-term outlook: gold has regained above its 9 period EMAs, the RSI above 50 zone, and MACD on the verge of giving positive crossover—classic signs of a short-term uptrend. As long as ₹96,500 remains supported, bulls retain control.In markets over the medium-to-long term, gold fundamentals remain favourable. Easing Fed rate pressure, geopolitical uncertainty, and supportive macro trends are expected to propel prices higher over the longer horizon.The bias is positive in the short run—watch ₹98,500–₹99,800 as next resistance.S ilver prices witnessed a significant rally recently, touching highs near ₹1,15,000 per kg before experiencing some profit booking and cooling off towards the ₹1,12,000 mark. Despite the short-term correction, the overall trend in silver remains firmly positive, underpinned by both technical strength and fundamental support.From a technical standpoint, silver continues to make higher highs and higher lows, a classic sign of a sustained uptrend. The key support is now placed at ₹1,09,000, and as long as prices hold above this level, the upward bias is likely to remain intact. On the higher side, a breakout above ₹1,15,000 could open the gates for a move towards ₹1,18,000 in the coming sessions.Fundamentally, silver continues to benefit from strong industrial demand, especially in sectors like electronics, electric vehicles, and solar panel manufacturing. Additionally, global macroeconomic uncertainties and expectations of potential rate cuts by major central banks have renewed investor interest in precious metals as a safe haven.Any dips towards support levels can be seen as buying opportunities for traders with a positive outlook. With the confluence of strong fundamentals and supportive technicals, silver prices are well-positioned to resume their upward trajectory in the medium term.","Experts are of the view that amidst ongoing global economic uncertainty due to Donald Trump’s tariff war, gold as a safe haven asset is in focus.

2. What does “tailored packages” mean in the new system?

3. How do I know if a Hajj campaign is approved?





Performing Hajj is a once-in-a-lifetime journey. But if you’re planning to go from the UAE in 2026, the process has changed and it’s important to get it right. The UAE has introduced a new approval system for Hajj campaign operators. This means not all travel agencies will qualify. Only those who meet strict criteria will be allowed to organize Hajj trips.The update comes after years of complaints about poor service and unclear planning. Authorities want to make sure pilgrims get a safer, more organized experience. So, before you register, take a moment to understand what’s new and how it affects you.Operators must now prove they can offer:Don’t sign up with a campaign unless it’s officially listed by the General Authority of Islamic Affairs, Endowments and Zakat.Campaigns will be tracked digitally and reviewed after Hajj. This helps authorities see who delivered and who didn’t. Expect digital check-ins, performance ratings, and follow-up surveys.Campaigns that offer tailored packages for seniors, families, or budget travelers are prioritized. Many organizers say flexible packages help meet the needs of different groups.Every country is given a fixed Hajj quota by Saudi Arabia. The UAE’s process now mirrors this. Only campaigns that pass the local screening will get access to that quota.If you’re not on the list via an approved campaign, you may not be allowed to go.Miss a step or a deadline, and your campaign may lose its approval. The goal is to avoid the chaos some pilgrims faced in earlier years. Keep an eye on official announcements, they’ll lay out the full process and dates.Hajj is one of the most important journeys in a Muslim’s life. But in recent years, some UAE pilgrims faced delays, unclear communication, or lack of proper care. The government wants to fix that by making sure only reliable campaigns get approved.The new system isn’t just about paperwork, it’s meant to make the Hajj experience smoother and safer for everyone.If you're applying through India’s Haj Committee, there’s a new option: a 20-day Short Hajj Package designed for people who can’t take extended time off.The Minority Affairs Ministry confirmed it in early July 2025, and the Haj Committee of India included it in their official Haj 2026 Policy.Here’s how it works:This could be a good option for working professionals or those with time constraints.No. Only agencies approved under the new UAE system are allowed to organize Hajj trips. Make sure the campaign you choose is officially accredited.It refers to options designed for different types of pilgrims, like affordable plans for budget travelers, or easier schedules for seniors.The General Authority of Islamic Affairs usually publishes a list of accredited campaigns before registration opens. Check their official channels.","The UAE has updated its Hajj campaign approval system to improve service and accountability.

When Tesla was founded in 2003, its goal was simple but ambitious: to change the way we think about cars by making electric vehicles the future of transportation. Nearly 22 years later, Tesla’s reach has grown well beyond Silicon Valley, making a strong presence in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The company first arrived in the UAE in 2017, not just as another car brand, but as a catalyst for change in the region’s automotive scene. Since then, Tesla has carefully expanded into Qatar in late 2023 and Saudi Arabia in early 2025, tailoring its models and support networks to fit each country’s unique pace.Today, the Gulf stands as a vital market in Tesla’s global strategy, with even its flagship models available, a clear indication of the region’s accelerating adoption of advanced electric mobility and its rising significance in Tesla’s international growth.Today, the Gulf stands as a vital market in Tesla’s global strategy, with a full range of models available, reflecting the region’s accelerating adoption of advanced electric mobility and its increasing significance in Tesla’s global growth.Tesla’s first official Middle East entry began in February 2017, when it launched in the UAE with the Model S and Model X, sold directly via Tesla’s website and supported by a growing physical footprint.The company began deliveries by mid-2017, opening showrooms and service centers in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah, and laying the groundwork for a vast network of over 300 Superchargers—some of them solar-powered.As of 2025, the UAE remains Tesla’s most developed GCC market, with five models currently available: the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck.The Model 3 remains the brand’s most accessible offering. It’s sold in three trims:The Model Y, a compact SUV built for families and utility, comes in:For luxury buyers, the Model S and Model X offer dual- and tri-motor configurations:Also available: the Cybertruck, priced at AED 300,800 (~$81,900 USD). Though it launched globally in late 2023, UAE buyers now have full access to the dual-motor AWD variant, known for its armored design and off-road credentials.Tesla launched in Saudi Arabia on April 10, 2025, opening its first showroom and service center in Riyadh, alongside a regional delivery hub. The launch was more than a retail expansion, it coincided with the Saudi government’s clean energy push under Vision 2030. Initial offerings include the Model 3, Model Y, and Cybertruck. Pop-up locations in Jeddah and Dammam are in development, and Superchargers have already gone live in multiple cities.The Model 3 lineup is identical to the UAE’s:The Model Y is also sold in three trims:The Cybertruck is available for pre-order, with deliveries expected by the end of 2025. Saudi buyers are expected to receive both the Dual Motor AWD and Cyberbeast (Tri-Motor) configurations.This delayed but impactful entry aligns with the country’s broader transition to clean mobility and domestic EV production partnerships (e.g. Lucid, Ceer), showing Tesla’s place in a much larger national shift.Tesla began taking orders in Qatar in December 2023, and opened its first retail location in June 2024, located in Doha Festival City mall. Though quieter than launches in the UAE and Saudi, Tesla’s Qatar operation quickly brought its full vehicle lineup to market.Currently available: the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X, with pricing across a wide range of trims.The Model 3 starts at QAR 164,990 (~$45,300 USD) for the standard 60 kWh RWD trim.The Model Y mirrors this:The Model S starts at QAR 391,190 ($107,400 USD) and climbs to QAR 431,490 ($118,400 USD) for the Plaid variant.The Model X ranges from QAR 407,290–447,390 (~$111,800–122,800 USD), depending on configuration.While Supercharging coverage is still developing, Tesla service is already active in Doha, with mobile support expanding to nearby areas like Al Khor and Ras Abu Aboud.With operations now active in the UAE (since 2017), Qatar (2023), and Saudi Arabia (2025), Tesla has completed its expansion into the Gulf’s three key economies. Each launch aligned with local conditions, policy support in the UAE, rising consumer demand in Qatar, and Saudi Arabia’s broader shift toward clean energy and industry.Across the region, Tesla now offers a broad lineup, primarily the Model 3 and Model Y in all three markets, with the higher-end Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck available in select countries like the UAE and Qatar.

GST revamp on the cards! PMO gives go-ahead for major overhaul of Goods and Services Tax; 12% tax slab may be removed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-revamp-on-the-cards-pmo-gives-go-ahead-for-major-overhaul-of-goods-and-services-tax-slabs-12-tax-rate-may-be-removed/articleshow/122559856.cms,"The new GST revamp proposal is expected to be presented to the GST Council. (AI image)

GST Slabs Set For Change

The current GST framework consists of five tax rates — nil, 5%, 12%, 18%, 28% — along with special rates of 0.25% and 3% which are applicable to precious metals.

Within the GST structure, approximately 21% of all goods fall under the 5% category.

The 12% bracket has 19% of items, whilst the 18% slab contains 44% of goods. The highest bracket of 28% applies to only 3% of the total items.

The authorities are considering eliminating the 12% tax bracket and redistributing these items between the 5% and 18% slabs.

Additional tax in the form of compensation cess applies to specific luxury and harmful products, such as cigarettes and automobiles, in the highest 28% bracket.

This was implemented to protect states from potential revenue losses during GST transition for five years until June 2022. The cess duration was subsequently extended to March 31, 2026, to service the debt of ₹2.69 lakh crore that the Centre borrowed for states during the Covid crisis to address the cess fund deficit.

The GST Council has appointed a dedicated group of ministers to evaluate the utilisation of excess funds in the cess collection and determine future actions regarding this matter.

GST Overhaul

When Will GST Rates Come Down?

GST revamp on the cards: Since its launch in 2017, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is set to undergo its first major revamp. The biggest takeaway from this move from the common man’s perspective is that the GST slabs may be rejigged, with items in the 12% category of tax possibly moving to the 5% bracket.According to an ET report, the Prime Minister’s Office has approved in-principle the substantial restructuring of the GST framework.Following the monsoon session of parliament, the new GST revamp proposal is expected to be presented to the GST Council, the highest decision-making authority for indirect taxes, which will meet in August.The timing is ideal for restructuring as tax systems have stabilised and economic indicators remain strong. With upcoming free trade agreements with developed nations, the government aims to remove obstacles that might prevent domestic industries from expanding their operations.Meanwhile, the income tax legislation is also set for an overhaul, with the new Incoem Tax bill expected in the monsoon session.According to the financial daily, the finance ministry will start discussions with states to establish political agreement on implementing these GST reforms.The ministry has already started internal consultations with relevant departments regarding the proposed changes, sources were quoted as saying.T he restructuring of GST will lead to both tax slab modifications and streamlined procedures, aiming to benefit both consumers and businesses. Although a ministerial group was tasked by the GST Council to evaluate rate rationalisation, progress has been limited.Industry people have recently presented strong arguments to the government for reforming the GST structure, including modifications to rates, slabs and procedures, whilst highlighting various operational challenges.Members of Parliament from different political parties have raised concerns about GST-related issues that require attention.Senior government officials have conducted thorough deliberations, and policy experts believe that a streamlined GST system could potentially enhance economic growth, according to a source familiar with the matter.","Since its launch in 2017, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is set to undergo its first major revamp.

The proposed rate for Mexico is 30%, slightly below the 35% planned for Canada.Trump has issued a series of letters recently, threatening to impose tariffs on various US trade partners, including Canada, Japan, Brazil, and others. The move, part of a renewed aggressive trade stance, also includes a 50% duty on copper imports.Despite international criticism, Trump appears firm on his position, backed by a strong US economy and soaring stock market.Both Mexico and the EU have denounced the proposed tariffs as unjust and disruptive but remain open to dialogue in hopes of reaching an agreement before the August 1 deadline.The Mexican President had earlier said that, ""We're also clear on what we can work with the United States government on, and we're clear on what we can't. And there's something that's never negotiable: the sovereignty of our country.”European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that the 30% tariffs would disrupt key transatlantic supply chains, harming businesses, consumers, and patients on both sides.""The European Union will allow complete, open Market Access to the United States, with no Tariff being charged to us, in an attempt to reduce the large Trade Deficit,"" Ursula added.So far, Trump has only secured basic trade agreements with a few countries like the UK, Indonesia, and Vietnam, while talks with other major partners are still underway.","Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that she and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have agreed to strengthen trade collaboration.

Trump’s history with Diet Coke



US President Donald Trump claimed on Wednesday that Coca-Cola has agreed to swap high-fructose corn syrup for real cane sugar in its soft drinks sold in the United States, following his personal request to the company.“I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “I’d like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them — You’ll see. It’s just better!”Coca-Cola has not confirmed any immediate change in ingredients but responded with a brief statement acknowledging Trump’s support, reports Axios. “We appreciate President Trump’s enthusiasm for our iconic Coca‑Cola brand. More details on new innovative offerings within our Coca‑Cola product range will be shared soon,” the company said in a statement.While the company did not say it would change its formula, it currently uses cane sugar in other markets, including Mexico, the UK, the Middle East and Africa. In the US, the beverage giant switched to high-fructose corn syrup in 1985 due to rising sugar costs and changes in farm subsidies.I f Coca-Cola fully reverts to cane sugar in the US, it could put pressure on domestic corn growers and food manufacturers. John Bode, President and CEO of the Corn Refiners Association, criticised the idea, saying, “Replacing high fructose corn syrup with cane sugar would cost thousands of American food manufacturing jobs, depress farm income, and boost imports of foreign sugar, all with no nutritional benefit. ”Trump is famously loyal to Diet Coke, once drinking up to 12 cans a day during his presidency, according to Time Magazine. He had a red button on the Oval Office desk to summon a butler with a Diet Coke.Ahead of his second-term inauguration, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey gifted Trump a special Presidential Commemorative Inaugural Diet Coke bottle.Trump immediately did not give a reason for pushing the sugar switch, though the announcement follows Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” campaign, which calls for removing corn syrup from American food.Health experts warn that both cane sugar and corn syrup pose similar risks, contributing to obesity and chronic diseases.One can of Coke contains around 39 grams of sugar, close to the 50-gram daily limit suggested for adults.",US President Donald Trump claims Coca-Cola has agreed to swap high-fructose corn syrup for real cane sugar in its soft drinks sold in the United States.

In a recent social media post, Trump called Powell “very dumb” and a “major loser”, writing: “You have cost the USA a fortune and continue to do so. You should lower the rate – by a lot!”Dimon said, “The President said he’s not going to try to remove Jay Powell,” adding that meddling with the central bank could have unintended consequences, according to an ET report. “Playing around with the Fed can often have adverse consequences, absolutely opposite of what you might be hoping for.”US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reportedly told Bloomberg TV that the White House is looking at candidates for Powell’s replacement. “There are a lot of great candidates. And we’ll see how rapidly it progresses. It’s President Trump’s decision and it will move at his speed,” Bessent said.Trump has on his part denied any intent to immediately replace Powell.JPMorgan reported a second-quarter net income of $15 billion, down 17% from the year-ago period, but still ahead of Wall Street expectations. The bank posted adjusted earnings of $5.24 per share, topping analysts’ estimate of $4.48 but lower than the $6.12 per share reported last year.Dimon also reiterated concerns about Trump’s trade policies, specifically tariffs and their long-term economic impact. “The finalization of tax reform and potential deregulation are positive for the economic outlook,” he said, “however, significant risks persist—including from tariffs and trade uncertainty, worsening geopolitical conditions, high fiscal deficits and elevated asset prices.”The veteran Wall Street chief, who has led America’s largest bank for nearly two decades, said the US economy remained resilient in the quarter and highlighted a rise in JPMorgan’s investment banking profits. But he warned that the president’s aggressive use of tariffs could undermine growth. “Significant risks persist,” Dimon repeated, pointing to a combination of domestic and global economic headwinds.The bank’s comments come at a time when Trump has appointed three new members to the National Capital Planning Commission and is expected to continue reshaping key economic and policy bodies, adding further pressure on central institutions.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon appeared to be delivering a message to Donald Trump regarding the US President’s pressure campaign on the Federal Reserve.

The President has repeatedly lashed out at Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively, recently calling the central banker a “numbskull” and a “moron.”On Tuesday, he took aim at a $2.5 billion renovation plan at the Federal Reserve, suggesting it could justify Powell’s removal. “I think it sort of is,” Trump said when asked if the spending was a fireable offense.According to US media reports, Trump has received political backing from Republican lawmakers for firing Powell. CNBC quoted a White House official as saying, “They expressed approval for firing him. The president indicated he likely will soon.”Powell, for his part, has made it clear he does not intend to step down early.

US market today: Stocks edge toward record highs after wholesale inflation data; strong bank earnings and tariff reprieve lift investors mood,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-today-july-16-wall-street-nasdaq-dow-jones-sp-500-wholesale-inflation-data-bank-earnings/articleshow/122578975.cms,"US stock indices rose on Wednesday after a better-than-expected wholesale inflation report lifted hopes that the Federal Reserve may resume rate cuts later this year.The S&P 500 inched up 0.2% in early trading, nearing its all-time high set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 170 points or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite hovered near its record from Tuesday, AP reported.The gains came as US Treasury yields slipped in response to a fresh inflation reading that showed wholesale prices cooled more than expected in June. The report offered some relief after Tuesday’s data showed rising costs for imported goods — including toys and apparel — amid President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff regime.“Wednesday’s encouraging report on inflation could give the Federal Reserve some confidence that it can resume cutting interest rates later this year,” AP noted.Among individual stocks, bank shares helped power gains. PNC Financial Services jumped 1.7% after a strong quarterly report, supported by loan growth. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs also rose over 0.5% each after beating analyst profit expectations.Johnson & Johnson surged 4.1% after the healthcare major beat Q2 sales and profit estimates and raised its full-year outlook. CEO Joaquin Duato said the company expects “game-changing approvals and submissions” in the second half for products targeting lung and bladder cancer.However, chipmaking equipment giant ASML dropped 9.7% in US trading after warning it couldn’t assure growth next year due to rising geopolitical tensions and tariffs. “The level of uncertainty is increasing, mostly due to macroeconomic and geopolitical consideration. And that includes, of course, tariffs,” CEO Christophe Fouquet said.Overseas, Jakarta’s stock index rose 0.7% after Trump softened his tariff stance on Indonesia, announcing a lower 19% levy instead of 32% following a trade deal. Indonesia’s central bank also cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.25%.President Prabowo Subianto said, “The most important thing for me is my people, as I must protect the interests of our workers.”In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury dropped to 4.46% from 4.50% on Tuesday, reflecting growing investor optimism that the Fed may find room to support the economy without stoking fresh inflation.While President Trump has repeatedly pushed the Fed to accelerate rate cuts, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has maintained a cautious stance, saying the central bank needs more data on how tariffs are impacting inflation before acting.","The S&P 500 inched up 0.2% in early trading, nearing its all-time high set last week.

US inflation trend: Producer prices remain flat in June; tariff effects may hit harder from August,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-trend-producer-prices-remain-flat-in-june-tariff-effects-may-hit-harder-from-august/articleshow/122578498.cms,"Wholesale inflation in the US showed no increase in June, indicating continued restraint on upstream price pressures despite mounting concerns over President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, according to fresh data from the Labor Department.The producer price index (PPI), which tracks prices before they reach consumers, was flat in June compared to the previous month, following a 0.3% uptick in May. On a year-on-year basis, wholesale prices rose 2.3%, the smallest increase since September and lower than economists had forecast, AP reported.Core PPI—which excludes food and energy—was also unchanged from May and up 2.6% from June 2024.The report came a day after the government said consumer prices rose 2.7% year-on-year in June, the sharpest rise since February. That increase was attributed in part to tariffs raising prices on imported goods ranging from appliances to groceries. However, economists warned that wholesale and retail inflation do not always move in lockstep.Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics, flagged a 0.3% increase in core wholesale goods as a sign of tariffs beginning to bite. “Furniture prices rose 1% from May and home electronics 0.8%,” Saunders noted, pointing out both are heavily import-reliant sectors.Still, wholesale steel prices fell 5.5%, defying expectations despite Trump’s 50% tariff on imported steel. Saunders suggested some companies may be drawing on pre-tariff inventories, but warned this buffer may soon run out. New 25% tariffs on Japanese and South Korean imports are set to kick in from August 1.“We are not out of the woods yet,” he cautioned.Retailers too are feeling the squeeze. Profit margins at auto retailers dropped 5.4%, suggesting dealers are absorbing some of the cost from Trump’s 25% tariff on foreign cars and parts. That aligns with Tuesday’s consumer inflation report showing a dip in new vehicle prices.Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told AP this may not last. “We doubt that auto retailers will continue to absorb the tariffs indefinitely,” he wrote, adding that prices could fall further before rebounding.Wholesale prices offer early signals of inflationary trends that affect consumers. They also feed into the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index.After raising interest rates 11 times across 2022 and 2023 to combat post-pandemic inflation spikes, the Fed cut rates three times in 2024. But in 2025, it has paused further easing as it monitors the impact of Trump’s trade policies. The president has also stepped up political pressure on the Fed to resume rate cuts, raising concerns about the central bank’s independence.","Wholesale inflation in the US showed no increase in June, indicating continued restraint on upstream price pressures.

Chinese toy giant Pop Mart is expecting its profits to increase by over 350 per cent in the first half of this year, driven by the remarkable global craze for its Labubu dolls, the company announced.The Beijing-headquartered firm, popular for its blind box collectibles, said revenues for the January-June period more than tripled, fuelled by booming international demand and cost control. Pop Mart’s stock market valuation has soared to over $40 billion, with its shares surging nearly 600 per cent in the past year.The viral Labubu dolls — quirky, elf-like characters with jagged teeth — have become a global sensation, flying off shelves and sparking long queues in stores worldwide.Originally launched in 2019, the dolls have boosted Pop Mart into a major international retailer, now operating over 2,000 vending machines and stores globally.Sales outside mainland China made up nearly 40 per cent of total revenue in 2024, a remarkable shift for the company which began trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2020.Vinci Zhang, senior analyst at equity research firm M Science, told the BBC that Labubu obsession in the United States has hit new highs, thanks in part to high-profile endorsements from celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Blackpink’s Lisa.According to M Science estimates, Labubu sales in the US surged by a staggering 5,000 per cent in June compared to the same period last year.“I’ve not seen anything like this from other toy companies,” Zhang remarked, highlighting the explosive growth in demand.Pop Mart’s collaborations with major brands like Coca-Cola and popular manga series One Piece have also raised Labubu’s global appeal.The frenzy has also sparked a thriving resale market, with dolls previously priced at 10 dollars now being sold for hundreds of dollars. In one case, a human-sized Labubu was auctioned for a massive 150,000 dollars in Beijing this June.The brand's popularity has also led to a surge in counterfeit products, often dubbed ""Lafufu dolls"".

Three months after shutting down Nvidia's AI intelligence chip sales to China, the Trump administration has reversed course.On Monday, the Silicon Valley company said the US government had approved sales of a China-specific AI chip known as H20. Nvidia will still need licencing approval from US government to fulfill those orders, but the Trump administration ""has assured Nvidia that licences will be granted,"" the company said.The decision came after Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, met last Thursday with President Trump. Huang has spent months lobbying politicians across Washington to keep China open for AI chip sales. China has the potential to deliver billions of dollars in sales for the world's most valuable public company, which last week became the first to reach a $4 trillion valuation. Huang has also visited China several times this year, including a trip to Beijing this week where he is scheduled to give a news conference on Wednesday.Commerce department and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The reversal has major implications for the race between the US and China to develop AI. It will allow Chinese tech companies to restart purchases of Nvidia's chips, regarded as ideal for running some of the calculations that power AI.Nvidia was slated to collect as much as $15 billion from sales of the H20 chip during its current fiscal year.With the change, Trump government has also backed away from a signature effort to stay ahead of China in the AI race. US government had been concerned the Chinese military could use AI chips to coordinate attacks and develop weapons and had also wanted to preserve the US lead in developing AI systems. Huang pressed the administration to roll back its restrictions on shipments of AI chips to China, arguing that closing off the China market will only hurt US tech companies.","The US government has approved sales of a China-specific AI chip known as H20.

The announcement signals an escalation in his broader “reciprocal tariff” strategy, set to formally take effect from 1 August.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday (local time) after attending an AI summit in Pittsburgh, Trump said, “Probably at the end of the month, and we’re going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we’re going to make it a very high tariff.”He added that tariffs on semiconductors were on a “similar” timeline and would be “less complicated” to enforce, Bloomberg reported.Earlier this month, Trump had already pledged a 50% tariff on copper and warned that pharmaceutical tariffs could rise as high as 200% after a one-year grace period for companies to shift production back to the US.His administration is pursuing these tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, claiming that the volume of drug imports poses a national security threat.If enacted, the pharmaceutical levies could directly impact multinational drugmakers such as Eli Lilly, Merck, and Pfizer, who rely heavily on overseas production. Meanwhile, chip tariffs are expected to affect not only semiconductor manufacturers but also consumer tech giants like Apple and Samsung, potentially driving up prices for smartphones and laptops.The threat comes as Trump has issued tariff letters to several trading partners in recent days, outlining import duties unilaterally, though he insists negotiations are still on the table.Earlier on Tuesday, Trump also announced a revised deal with Indonesia, cutting its proposed tariff rate from 32% to 19%, in exchange for multibillion-dollar US purchases, including 50 Boeing aircraft.",US President Donald Trump said he is likely to impose tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals by the end of the month.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices have been somewhat stable in the last few days, with safe haven assets being in focus even as global economic uncertainty wanes despite US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. A strong dollar has capped gains in gold. What’s the outlook for gold prices and what strategy should investors adopt in the current scenario? Here's the analysis from Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities:Gold prices have shown resilience around key support levels, with the MCX Gold August Futures currently trading around ₹97,480. The underlying tone remains cautiously optimistic, supported by a bounce from critical moving average confluence. With momentum indicators showing signs of stabilization, the intraday bias shifts towards a Buy on Dip strategy near ₹97,350, with downside risk capped around ₹96,800.1. EMA Alignment Signals Support: The 8-period EMA stands at ₹97,450, while the 21-period EMA is at ₹97,350. The price is currently testing the 21-EMA support, creating a favorable entry zone around ₹97,350. This confluence of moving averages provides a strong foundation for potential upward momentum.2. Bollinger Bands Indicate Consolidation: The Bollinger Bands show price action consolidating within the bands, with the lower band providing support near the ₹97,350 zone. This tight range suggests potential volatility expansion, favoring a breakout scenario once the accumulation phase completes.3. Pivot Point Perspective: Previous day's pivot points reveal strong support confluence around the ₹97,350 level. The price structure shows respect for these technical levels, with multiple touches confirming the zone's significance for intraday positioning.4. RSI (14) Reading: The Relative Strength Index is currently in neutral territory, suggesting room for upward movement without immediate overbought concerns. This positioning supports the buy-on-dip thesis as momentum can expand in either direction.5. MACD Momentum: The MACD indicator shows potential bullish divergence forming, with the histogram suggesting underlying strength building. This technical pattern often precedes renewed upward momentum from support zones.6. Price Structure and Volume: Recent price action shows strong buying interest near the ₹97,350 support level, with volume accumulation suggesting institutional participation. The price closing above key congestion zones confirms sustained demand at these levels.Gold intraday bias remains constructive on pullbacks. Traders can adopt a Buy on Dip strategy near the ₹97,350 mark, placing a protective stop-loss at ₹96,800. Upside targets for the session could be ₹97,800 and ₹98,200, provided the global sentiment remains supportive and prices hold above the 21-period EMA confluence.","Gold prices have shown resilience around key support levels.

Investors seek a bite of food & beverages pie,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/investors-seek-a-bite-of-food-beverages-pie/articleshow/122802729.cms,"AI image

MUMBAI: A lot is happening over food. From Theobroma to Haldiram's and Biryani By Kilo, investors (investment firms and corporates alike) are lining up to take a bite of India's food (captures packaged food as well as food services like QSR) and beverages (F&B) space.A broader sluggishness in consumption had slowed down the pace of deal closures; Haldiram's and Theobroma, for instance, were in the works for a long time, but the appetite to partake of India's consumption story remains high, and deal counters seem to be buzzing. Investors are evaluating brands (deals could be in the form of funding or acquisitions of significant stakes) such as Nik Baker's and Wow! Momo, an industry source said.""There is also a QSR pizza chain based in the North which has seen some interest from investors. In the packaged food space, almost a dozen deals are in the pipeline in the ready-to-eat/ready-to-cook segments,"" the source said.Fireside Ventures has a very strong pipeline of food deals, partner Dipanjan Basu told TOI, whereas Belgian investor Verlinvest, which has backed brands like Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters, Lahori Zeera, and Epigamia, is set to pump in fresh follow-on funds in its existing food companies in addition to new deals, taking the total amount of India investments this year to more than the targeted $100 million.""For global investors looking to invest in India, consumer and healthcare must be on the shopping list! There is interest in performing companies, and the next couple of years should augur well for consumption given the tax breaks and factors such as the reduction in import duty for edible oil, etc. ,"" said Arjun Anand, managing director and head of Asia at Verlinvest.Earlier this year, Temasek, IHC (International Holding Company), and Alpha Wave Global acquired minority stakes in Haldiram Snacks Food, valuing the family-owned company at $10 billion. KFC operator Devyani International acquired a majority stake in Biryani By Kilo's parent, Sky Gate Hospitality, while most recently, ChrysCapital closed a deal to acquire a majority stake in bakery chain Theobroma Foods.Another brand, The Belgian Waffle Co., has been in the market for at least a year now, although sources have indicated that the deal is now potentially looking like a minority stake acquisition compared to a majority transaction before. ""India's food space is a large industry with an attractive growth profile based on the shift from unorganised to organised. With an increase in disposable income and convenience-led multiple food options via food aggregators, Indians are eating out and ordering food more than before.""This has given opportunity to many homegrown brands to scale. As private equity investors, our endeavour is to discover market leaders that are growing at 1.5-2 times the industry growth rate,"" said Rajiv Batra, director and leads, investment opportunities, consumer sector at ChrysCapital.In the QSR space, interest is typically to back pan-India brands, while in the packaged food segment, regional brands are equally being looked at by investors. ""In QSR, unit economics and TAM (total addressable market) are generally more attractive than the casual dining space, where returns on investments have been tepid. Investors made good returns in the QSR space,"" said Mayank Rastogi, markets leader, strategy and transactions practice at EY. In the food services space, IPOs have largely been the mode of exit, while in packaged food, M&A is a big theme. ""FMCG players are hungry for acquisitions,"" Rastogi added.The rise of new age brands building clean labels (no maida, no oil food) and healthy food offerings have broadened the scope for investors in the packaged food segment, said Basu, adding that quick commerce has been a big tailwind for the sector. “Food brands earlier found it hard to scale the business but now quick commerce has enabled easy distribution,” said Basu.Many more capital raising deals are expected to close this year as brands seek growth capital to penetrate deeper and scale nationally, said Siddharth Bafna, partner at Lodha & Co. “We also anticipate an increase in M&A activity as larger companies pursue inorganic growth to expand their category presence and consolidation among small to mid-sized companies seeking to become IPO ready,” Bafna said. ITC and Reliance are among firms that have made acquisitions in the food space this year.","Investors are lining up to take a bite of India's food (captures packaged food as well as food services like QSR) and beverages (F&B) space.

Viceroy calls semiconductor unit of Vedanta a 'sham op',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/viceroy-calls-semiconductor-unit-of-vedanta-a-sham-op/articleshow/122802811.cms,"Vedanta

NEW DELHI: Continuing its tirade against mining heavyweight Anil Agarwal 's Vedanta group, US-based Viceroy Research has alleged that the group's semiconductor unit was a ""sham commodities trading operation"", designed to avoid classification as an NBFC, a charge the conglomerate called baseless.The short seller, which last week published a scathing report about Vedanta Group and followed it up with similar reports on group companies, in fresh allegations said Vedanta Ltd's subsidiary, Vedanta Semiconductors Pvt Ltd, was part of a scheme to allow the Mumbai-listed firm to remit brand fees to parent Vedanta Resources in April this year, when it faced a severe liquidity crisis. In a statement, Vedanta spokesperson said the group ""strongly rejects the baseless allegations made in the report regarding Vedanta Semiconductors Pvt Ltd (VSPL)"". ""All business activities of VSPL have been transparently disclosed and are in line with statutory norms,"" it said.Viceroy said, ""VSPL is a sham commodities trading operation designed to improperly avoid classification as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC)"". ""This scheme was devised to facilitate Vedanta Ltd's remittance of brand fees to Vedanta Resources' (VRL) in April 2025, when it faced a severe liquidity crisis,"" Viceroy said.""VSPL's operational illusion needs 24 months of regulatory silence to fulfil its purpose, repaying its offshore lenders and hiding the near-catastrophe of April 2024. While credit analysts are snoozing through the alarm bells, India's regulators are famously light sleepers,"" it added.","US-based Viceroy Research has alleged that the group's semiconductor unit was a ""sham commodities trading operation"" Vedanta Ltd's subsidiary, Vedanta Semiconductors Pvt Ltd, was part of a scheme to allow the Mumbai-listed firm to remit brand fees to parent Vedanta Resources in April this year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122802821,imgsize-40008,width-400,resizemode-4/122802821.jpg"
Govt keeps tabs on capex as private investment lags,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-keeps-tabs-on-capex-as-private-investment-lags/articleshow/122802662.cms,"Representational Image

NEW DELHI: Govt is keeping a close watch on capex as private investment remains weak, some of which may be on account of the global uncertainty induced by the US President Donald Trump's tariff regime.During April-May, Centre's capital expenditure has been higher with ministries and departments spending 20% of their allocation for the year, compared with 13% in the first two months of the last fiscal year. Over the last five years, capex by the Centre has been a key policy tool to boost investment in the economy with the expectation that the multiplier effect will generate demand for inputs and create jobs and spur private investment.The private sector has, however, largely watched from the sidelines barring sectors such as cement and steel where companies are lining up investment to meet the demand created by public investment in roads & railways. There has been heightened activity in sectors such as electronics, induced by schemes such as PLI.But overall capacity utilisation is not seen at levels where companies would ramp up investment to set up new production lines.In sectors such as automobiles and energy, the shift towards greener technologies is resulting in some investments being held up, industry sources said. While acknowledging the weak private investment, govt sources said efforts are being made to understand the measures that may be needed to boost activity. Further, the sources said, some of the central projects may not have more absorptive capacity to step up capex and govt may explore newer segments of the economy to divert more public investment. These could include spaces such as urban infrastructure with the finance ministry and other wings of govt expected to hold discussions in the coming months.Given the needs of the economy and the growth expected in coming years, the focus on capex is going to remain, with private sector expected to take the baton sooner or later.For the current fiscal year, the Centre has budgeted for capex of Rs 11.4 lakh crore of which nearly half is allocated to roads and railways.","During April-May, Centre's capital expenditure has been higher with ministries and departments spending 20% of their allocation for the year.

HDFC duo's merger still looms over industry's credit growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-duos-merger-still-looms-over-industrys-credit-growth/articleshow/122802519.cms,"HDFC Bank

MUMBAI: The merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank in FY24, which slowed down bank credit growth in FY25, continues to remain a drag on overall lending, pulling industry credit growth into single digits in Q1FY26. The combined entity's loan growth fell from 15-17% before the merger to 5.4% in FY25 and remained below the industry pace in the June quarter. According to RBI data, bank credit growth stood at 9.5% at the end of Q1, while deposits grew 10.1%. As against this HDFC Bank's outstanding loans and deposits grew 6.7% and 16.2%.The slowdown was part of a strategy to restore balance sheet stability following a spike in the credit-deposit (CD) ratio and a skewed funding mix after HDFC's Rs 6 lakh crore loan book was absorbed. Although HDFC Bank gained in market share and balance sheet size, its contribution to incremental credit growth remained limited, affecting the broader banking system's performance.In a call with analysts on July 19, HDFC Bank MD & CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan said, ""We slowed down our average advances or AUM growth to about 7% last year, in alignment with our strategic objectives to bring down the CD ratio from 110% at the time of the merger to about 95% as we speak today.This rate of growth in AUM has improved to 8% in the June 2025 quarter.""The home loan portfolio, which was HDFC's core strength, grew only 7% year-on-year, slower than 9% industry growth, reflecting weak momentum after the merger. Jagdishan said the mortgage segment has seen ""intense competition"" particularly from public sector enterprises offering rates around 7.1% to 7.3%. HDFC Bank has chosen not to match those rates, focusing instead on pricing loans 50-80 basis points higher while offering better service and targeting broader customer relationships.The bank expects consumption to recover in both urban and rural areas, supported by the festival season. Jagdishan said sentiment, lower rates, and fiscal incentives could drive growth. He also pointed to rising momentum in the MSME segment, helped by early exports aimed at benefiting from potential tariff changes.On staffing, the bank added about 4,000 employees this quarter, largely to support branches. Jagdishan said the bank is working towards having ""more and more people customer-facing and maybe revenue-generating"" as part of its long-term direction.","HDFC Bank's loan growth fell from 15-17% before the merger to 5.4% in FY25.

Do you have any plans to build and operate airports abroad too?

Jeet Adani

What is the investment that the upcoming Navi Mumbai will see?

How do you plan to fund this capex?

What makes you so bullish on aviation, given the not so happy relation between airlines and airports here in the past?

AHMEDABAD: Operating seven airports in India, including Mumbai CSMIA with Navi Mumbai set to join the list this Oct, the Adani group will invest close to Rs 1 lakh crore in its airport business over the next five years. This capex will be spread over both infra and real estate development. The conglomerate’s airport head Jeet Adani (27), son of patriarch Gautam Adani , says the potential in India is so immense that it has no immediate plans to expand this vertical of business abroad. Excerpts:We do five-year rolling planning. In the next five years, our total investment planned in the airports ecosystem between infrastructure and real estate is almost Rs 95,000-96,000 crore. The biggest chunk of the capex will be at Navi Mumbai Airport, Mumbai Airport and real estate in these two places.The other big projects are to build new terminals at airports in places like Ahmedabad, Jaipur and Thiruvananthapuram in next four years. The recently-built terminal in Lucknow will be expanded. A new terminal at Guwahati is ready and will be commissioned this Oct-Nov.Not immediately. We see too much opportunity in India and don’t want to distract ourselves by going abroad.We keep getting feelers from abroad. But at the end of the day, it’s about our management bandwidth and where do we want to keep our capital. We believe India will see some serious growth in the next 10-15 years. There’s so much growth opportunity here with 26 airports already identified for being developed PPP way. Our focus is on going deeper in India and establishing a broader presence here, rather than going abroad.We clubbed phase I and II of that airport and will open with an initial capacity of 2 crore passengers annually (CPA) instead of building 1 CPA at a time. This has been built with a capex of Rs 19,000 crore. We have already started work on T2 for Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) which could either be 3-CPA capacity at Rs 30,000 crore or 5-CPA capacity with a capex of Rs 40-45,000 crore.That decision will be taken shortly and T2 construction work will start in 6-12 months. Our overall capex on NMIA that will take it to the ultimate capacity of 9 CPA will be Rs 1 lakh crore. A completely new T1 at Mumbai CSMIA will be built by 2032 at a cost of Rs 5,000 crore.Equity we will put on our own. We have to refinance NMIA. The same lenders have already expressed willingness to participate in the next round. Our philosophy is to pre-invest in infra because we are willing to take a position on the growth of the aviation sector and growth of the economy of the cities we are in. The sector has some real tailwinds.We are not here just as an airport operator but are here to drive the entire ecosystem forward. It is not a fight between airline and airport operators. Collectively, our aviation ecosystem has to get the traffic currently transiting between India and rest of the world through nearby hubs in the Gulf, Southeast Asia and even Europe (for North America market). Those places have a deep integration between airports and airlines, which as of now is not there in India. Fortunately as a group, we have fantastic relationship with IndiGo and the Tatas. We have spoken to both and have asked them to include us into their planning and be a part of our planning.",The Adani group will invest close to Rs 1 lakh crore in its airport business over the next five years.

‘Unjustified and illegal’: Rosneft slams EU’s sanctions on Nayara Energy; says India’s energy security at risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/unjustified-and-illegal-rosneft-slams-eus-sanctions-on-nayara-energy-says-indias-energy-security-at-risk/articleshow/122799735.cms,"Representative image

Russian oil giant Rosneft has hit out at the European Union for imposing sanctions on its Indian affiliate Nayara Energy, calling the move “unjustified and illegal” and warning that it could directly threaten India’s energy security.In a statement issued Sunday, Rosneft said the EU’s action amounted to extraterritorial and politically motivated restrictions that infringe on international law and the economic interests of sovereign states.“These sanctions are yet another example of extraterritorial implementation of politically motivated restrictions that blatantly violate international law and infringe on the economic interests of a sovereign state,” Rosneft said, as per news agency PTI.The European Union on Friday imposed a fresh round of sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine, targeting Rosneft’s Indian refinery and lowering the oil price cap. The move is aimed at further choking off Russian revenues and includes new banking curbs and restrictions on fuels derived from Russian crude.While India was not directly named, the sanctions could impact Nayara Energy, which operates a major refinery in Gujarat.Russian crude currently makes up nearly 40 per cent of India’s total oil imports, and as the second-largest buyer of Russian oil, India could benefit from the lower price cap, now set at USD 60 per barrel.However, Rosneft argued that it holds less than 50 per cent stake in Nayara Energy and has no controlling interest. “Nayara is managed by an independent Board of Directors,” the company said, adding that its profits are reinvested in developing the refinery and its retail network, with no dividend payouts to shareholders.Rosneft also asserted that the refinery is a strategic asset for India, contributing to the country’s fuel supply and economic stability. “The imposition of sanctions against the refinery directly threatens India's energy security and will have a negative impact on its economy,” it said.As per PTI, Rosneft said it expects Nayara to take steps to protect the interests of its shareholders and consumers, supported by the governments of Russia and India.Meanwhile, think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has warned that India’s $15 billion worth of petroleum exports to the EU could be at risk due to these restrictions.GTRI noted that the EU’s ban on fuels refined from Russian oil in third countries like India may significantly impact India’s outbound shipments of diesel, petrol and jet fuel.",Russian oil giant Rosneft has hit out at the European Union for imposing sanctions on its Indian affiliate Nayara Energy.

Air India tragedy: AAIB expands probe team; ex-operations chief RS Sandhu onboard as domain expert,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/air-india-tragedy-aaib-expands-probe-team-ex-ops-chief-rs-sandhu-onboard-as-domain-expert/articleshow/122799422.cms,"Representative image

The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has brought on board veteran pilot and former Air India director of operations captain RS Sandhu as a domain expert in the ongoing probe into the fatal plane crash in Ahmedabad that killed 260 people last month.Sandhu, who spent nearly four decades at Air India and once served as a designated examiner for the Boeing 787-8 fleet, had personally taken delivery of the now-crashed aircraft, VT-ANB, in 2013.Sources quoted by the news agency PTI claim that the AAIB approached Sandhu to lend his expertise, and he agreed to be part of the investigation.The crash occurred on June 12 when Air India’s Boeing 787-8 aircraft, operating flight AI171 from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick, crashed into a building shortly after takeoff. Among the 242 people onboard, only one survived, while 19 others were killed on the ground.A five-member AAIB team, led by Sanjay Kumar Singh, is investigating the tragedy. The panel is supported by domain experts including experienced pilots, engineers, aviation medicine specialists, psychologists, and flight recorder specialists.According to PTI, several pilot associations had earlier expressed concern over the absence of subject matter experts in the probe.The Airline Pilots' Association of India (ALPA India) had specifically urged the AAIB to include experienced aviators in the investigation.Sandhu, now the founder of aviation consultancy Aviazione, had also led the Tata Group airline integration task force. His inclusion is expected to enhance the depth and credibility of the probe.The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has reiterated support for the AAIB investigation. NTSB chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said all media reports speculating on the cause are ""premature"" and should be avoided. ""Investigations of this magnitude take time,"" she said on X.","Former Air India captain RS Sandhu has joined the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) as a domain expert.

Trump also faces revolt from the Republican base



Trump and Epstein's bond







A bizarre birthday letter gifted to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003 has started a row surrounding the MAGA chief himself.Donald Trump seems to be in deep trouble as The Wall Street Journal revealed and reported a note gifted to the pedophile Epstein bearing Trump’s name and included a crude drawing of a naked woman.The US president has strongly denied the claims and threatened legal action.The letter is part of a collection compiled for Epstein’s 50th birthday, featuring an outline of a woman’s body with the word “Donald” written where pubic hair would be. It also included typewritten text and concluded with the line: “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” The note was included in a birthday album reportedly assembled by Ghislaine Maxwell , Epstein’s former right-hand woman and convicted child sex trafficker.The letter in question had been part of the material reviewed by justice department investigators in a previous probe into Epstein’s activities. The birthday album compiled by Maxwell included messages from multiple high-profile individuals and was created as a keepsake for Epstein’s 50th birthday celebration.WSJ reviewed the document and published its findings on Thursday. This was followed by an immediate and aggressive response from Trump.He denied both writing the letter and drawing the image. “I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women,” Trump told The Wall Street Journal. “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”He further threatened to sue The Wall Street Journal, NewsCorp and Rupert Murdoch for publishing the story. “President Trump will be suing The Wall Street Journal, NewsCorp, and Mr. Murdoch, shortly,” read a Truth Social post made Thursday. Trump also claimed his team, including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, had warned the outlet not to publish what he called a “fake” letter.That same night, Trump said on Truth Social that he had authorised Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval.” Bondi responded on X that she was prepared to do so.US vice president JD Vance came to Trump’s defence, calling the Journal article “complete and utter bullshit” in a post on X. Prominent MAGA supporters were quick to dismiss the report as false.Far-right activist Laura Loomer, who has been demanding more transparency from the administration on the Epstein files, wrote on X: “Everyone who actually KNOWS President Trump knows he doesn’t type letters. He writes notes in big black Sharpie.”Charlie Kirk, another influential Trump ally, also rejected the idea that Trump authored the note. “This is not how Trump talks at all. I don’t believe it,” he wrote.The report has emerged at a time when Trump’s handling of the Epstein investigation is under increasing scrutiny from within his own base. A faction of Trump supporters had expected his administration to release all remaining Epstein-related files, and were angered when the justice department announced last week that it would not be doing so.In a memo, the department said that Epstein died by suicide and that there was no “client list.” The decision triggered a backlash from several Trump allies who had been calling for greater disclosure.However, Trump lashed out at the criticism. “Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bullshit,’ hook, line, and sinker,” he wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday. He later said Bondi could release any “credible” files on the matter but also criticised “stupid and foolish Republicans” for continuing to press the issue.Karoline Leavitt clarified on Thursday that Trump “would not recommend” the appointment of a special counsel to reopen the Epstein investigation.Trump had known Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s and was photographed with him on several occasions. His name also appeared in flight logs of Epstein’s private jet. However, Trump has repeatedly insisted that their friendship ended well before Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor. He also stated they had not spoken in around 15 years by the time Epstein was arrested again in 2019.Jeffrey Epstein died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide by medical examiners, but the circumstances have led to ongoing speculation and conspiracy theories.",The Wall Street Journal revealed and reported a note gifted to the pedophile Epstein bearing Trump's name and included a crude drawing of a naked woman.

Let these actions serve as a warning to any country who thinks it can take advantage of the US, our carriers, and our market.

Blackstone drops out TikTok US deal consortium: Why the firm backed out?

The company, which generated $43 billion in revenue during the first quarter, has now exceeded Meta's quarterly earnings, Reuters reported quoting sources.The US consortium backed by the administration in the TikTok deal includes private equity firm KKR and new investors like Andreessen Horowitz, with Oracle also expected to take a stake. However, it remains unclear whether all original consortium members are still part of the bid.Earlier this year, the group was working on a plan to spin off TikTok’s US operations into a separate American company. But negotiations stalled after China signaled it would block the deal, shortly after Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese imports.If a deal goes through, TikTok's US operations are expected to be run by a new joint venture between an American investor group and ByteDance, which would retain a minority stake.Blackstone’s decision to withdraw underscores the growing uncertainty and complications surrounding the deal. The future of TikTok has become entangled in broader US-China trade tensions, with Trump indicating he would discuss the issue directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping.TikTok is already developing a separate version of the app for the US market.","Private equity firm's exit comes amid growing uncertainty and multiple delays in the TikTok transaction.

Explained: What are EU’s fresh sanctions on Russia? Here’s what they mean,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/explained-what-are-eus-fresh-sanctions-on-russia-heres-what-they-mean/articleshow/122783561.cms,"1. Russian oil: A fresh price cap

Currently, that would put the cap at around $47.60 per barrel, a significant drop from the $60 limit introduced by the G7 in December 2022.

This lower threshold is designed to curb Russia’s energy income while avoiding a shock to global oil supplies.

This rule excludes imports from Norway, Britain, the US, Canada, and Switzerland.

The EU is ending the Czech Republic’s exemption from the bloc-wide seaborne Russian oil ban, after the country shifted entirely to alternative suppliers.

The EU sanctions package also targets India’s Nayara oil refinery, in which Russia’s largest oil producer, Rosneft, holds a major share.

3. Targeting the 'Shadow Fleet'

105 additional ships have been banned from EU ports and waters.

These include vessels engaging in ship-to-ship transfers, a common method used to mask the origin of Russian oil.

The total number of sanctioned ships now exceeds 400, according to Reuters.

4. Nord Stream: Total cut-off

5. Financial sector: A blanket ban

The ban also targeted Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).

EU countries agreed to lower the threshold for penalising foreign financial entities found to be helping Russia evade sanctions or fund the war effort.

6. Export restrictions and new blacklist entries

The bloc will bar exports of certain chemicals, plastics and machinery to Russia.

26 new entities have been added to the sanctions list for circumventing restrictions, including, 7 in China, 3 in Hong Kong, 4 in Turkey.

7. Delays and diplomatic hurdles

Slovakia objected due to concerns about an upcoming EU plan to ban Russian gas imports by 2028.

It lifted its veto earlier this week after receiving guarantees from the EU to mitigate potential losses.

How did India react?

The European Union unveiled its 18th package of sanctions against Russia, aiming to further squeeze Moscow’s oil revenues and financial networks over its ongoing war in Ukraine. Approved on Friday, the new measures include a series of toughened restrictions focused largely on the energy sector, shipping, and financial dealings.Here’s a what the latest sanctions include:At the heart of this package is a new price cap on Russian oil. The EU plans to impose a moving price ceiling, pegged at 15% below the average market price of Russian crude.The measure takes effect from 3 September, with a 90-day transition period for existing contracts. Under the new rules, any crude purchased above the cap cannot be shipped, insured or reinsured by EU firms, as per a Reuters report.The European Union and Britain had been urging the G7 to reduce the existing $60 price cap on Russian oil, arguing that falling oil futures had rendered it ineffective. However, opposition from the United States stalled any collective action, prompting the EU to act independently.Still, the bloc faces limits in enforcing the measure, as oil is predominantly traded in US dollars and payment clearing is largely controlled by American banks.After a six-month grace period, the EU will no longer import petroleum products made from Russian oil, even if they’re refined elsewhere.In an effort to disrupt Russia’s workaround using ageing tankers:The EU also blacklisted a private operator of an international flag registry and an entity involved in Russia’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector, though it did not disclose their names.The EU will ban all transactions linked to the Nord Stream gas pipelines, which run under the Baltic Sea. This includes the provision of goods and services to the infrastructure.In a major escalation, the EU will now prohibit all transactions with Russian financial institutions, many of which are already cut off from SWIFT.The approval of this package wasn’t smooth. Slovakia and Malta initially delayed the rollout:The ministry of external affairs on Friday hit out at the European Union’s “unilateral” sanctions on Russia, criticising the bloc’s “double standards” in energy trade.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement in post on X, ""We have noted the latest sanctions announced by the European Union. India does not subscribe to any unilateral sanction measures. We are a responsible actor and remain fully committed to our legal obligations.""The MEA further emphasised that ensuring energy security is a top priority for the Indian government to meet the essential needs of its citizens. “We would stress that there should be no double standards, especially when it comes to energy trade,” the statement added.The EU’s latest sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine war include measures targeting an Indian refinery partly owned by Rosneft. The Russian energy giant holds a 49.13% stake in Nayara Energy Ltd, formerly Essar Oil. Nayara operates a major refinery in Vadinar, Gujarat, with an annual capacity of 20 million tonnes, and runs over 6,750 fuel stations across India.","The European Union unveiled its 18th package of sanctions against Russia.

The recently enacted Donald Trump's ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ is potentially turning out to another blow to Indian students in the United States by allocating approximately $170 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for expanding deportation operations.This legislation strengthens enforcement agencies' authority to monitor local communities and track visa violations, according to study abroad platform executives. Students on Optional Practical Training (OPT) face heightened risks, as even minimal delays in securing employment or exceeding visa duration could result in severe penalties.Additionally, the legislation's new 1% remittance tax is anticipated to impact students who transfer funds to their home country for family support or loan repayments. ""Even a small tax can affect low-income students — every dollar counts when supporting tuition or families back home,"" said Adarsh Khandelwal, cofounder of Collegify, quoted by Economic Times. This taxation applies to international transfers by F-1 student visa holders, H-1B workers, and green card holders using traditional payment methods. A $10 tax would apply to a $1,000 transfer to India.Students paying full fees without scholarships will not be subject to this tax, which becomes effective after January 1, 2026.Education consultants view this tax as a minor inconvenience rather than a significant barrier. ""A 1% rate is annoying, not prohibitive,"" said Nikhil Jain, founder of ForeignAdmits, as quoted by ET. ""Students are resourceful; they'll adapt by consolidating transfers, exploring digital wallets, or simply factoring it into their budget,"" he added.The tax represents an additional concern for Indian students in the US. Since January, increased scrutiny of non-immigrant visa holders and deportation of unauthorised residents has heightened anxiety. Recent intensification of visa procedures and social media monitoring has caused unease. ""Students are becoming hypervigilant about everything – their social media presence, their financial transactions, their visa status,"" Jain of ForeignAdmits said. ""This tax is just adding to the paranoia.""Experts report that students and visa applicants are removing previous social media content and exercising increased caution regarding their online activities.The legislation also reduces federal support, including Medicaid and SNAP benefits for state colleges, which previously assisted numerous students.This reduction might increase institutions' reliance on international students paying full fees, who are exempt from the new remittance tax.Nevertheless, only a small proportion of Indian students attend prestigious US universities at full cost, with most relying on financial assistance or attending mid-tier institutions.Education experts suggest that prospective Indian students might now consider alternative study destinations.",Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' is potentially turning out to another blow to Indian students in the United States.

One seeks to introduce a comprehensive regulatory regime for digital assets, while the other aims to prohibit the issuance of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the US Both bills are now headed to the Senate for further debate.The $4 trillion figure highlights how far the crypto sector has come since its early days as a speculative, niche market.Today, digital assets are attracting growing interest from asset managers, corporate treasuries, and everyday investors. The launch of new exchange-traded products and increasing adoption by both retail and institutional players is placing cryptocurrencies at the heart of mainstream financial conversations.Stablecoins, designed to maintain a fixed value, typically tied 1:1 to the US dollar, have become a cornerstone of crypto trading, enabling users to seamlessly move funds across tokens. Their rapid growth has fuelled calls for structured oversight, with advocates suggesting they could revolutionise instant payment systems.“The Genius Act will go down in history as a law that served as a foundational step in mainstreaming of crypto as an asset class,” said Chris Perkins, president of crypto investment firm CoinFund.Institutional enthusiasm continues to build, with a rising number of public companies allocating bitcoin to their treasuries as a long-term store of value.Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, recently crossed the $120,000 mark, its highest level ever, before retreating 1.8% on Friday to help bring the sector’s valuation slightly down to $3.92 trillion.Analysts at brokerage Bernstein have forecast bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025.Meanwhile, ether, the second-largest crypto token, climbed 4.5% and has more than doubled in value over the past three months.The ongoing rally has also lifted crypto-linked equities, as per a Reuters report.Shares of Coinbase and Robinhood, both of which facilitate cryptocurrency trading, hit all-time highs on Friday.

Political stance





US President Donald Trump on Friday signed the ""GENIUS Act,"" a new law aimed at regulating payment stablecoins, marking a significant step toward bringing legitimacy and oversight to the cryptocurrency industry.The law, officially titled ""Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins,"" represents a major policy shift for digital assets in the US. The new law received strong support in both the House and Senate, passing with wide bipartisan backing.Speaking at a White House signing ceremony attended by around 200 people, including prominent crypto executives and top Republican lawmakers, Trump called the law a “massive validation” of the industry’s efforts.“For years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,” he told the attendees.“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,"" the US president added.Later, taking to Truth Social, he wrote ""I pledged that we would bring back American liberty and leadership and make the US the crypto capital of the world—The Genius Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins…""The “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins"" or GENIUS Act is a set of regulatory frameworks aimed at establishing oversight and consumer protections for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies tied to traditional assets like the US dollar to reduce price volatility.It lays down foundational rules for stablecoin issuers, aimed at improving consumer confidence in a segment of crypto that has seen explosive growth, as per AP.The new law is a big step for an industry that has quickly gained political influence in Washington, thanks to heavy lobbying and campaign donations.A notable provision in the new law prohibits members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins, a move intended to address concerns over conflicts of interest, according to AP.However, the ban does not apply to the president or his family. Trump's family is known to hold a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto firm that launched its own stablecoin earlier this year, backed in part by an investment fund from the United Arab Emirates.The House also advanced two additional crypto-related bills on Thursday. One proposes a new market structure for the broader cryptocurrency space, while the other seeks to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency.

Bottom line



July 2025. A packed Coldplay concert. Sixty thousand people swaying to Fix You. And then—on the stadium's Kiss Cam—two familiar-looking executives: Andy Byron , CEO of Astronomer, and Kristin Cabot, his Chief People Officer. They don’t kiss. But they don’t exactly recoil either.Within hours, the clip had gone viral. Was it an affair? A PR disaster? An HR crisis? But the more mundane—and surprisingly popular—question on Google was:What is Astronomer, and why is its CEO at a Coldplay concert with HR?Here’s the answer.Despite its celestial name, Astronomer is not a space company. It’s a tech firm that operates in the world of data orchestration. In other words, it builds the infrastructure that lets large companies move and manage their data in real time—so apps can give you accurate updates, AI models can make smart predictions, and dashboards can tell you what’s going wrong.Astronomer’s key product is a cloud-based service called Astro, which simplifies a popular open-source tool named Apache Airflow.Apache Airflow is an open-source system originally built at Airbnb. Think of it as a conductor for all the tasks in a company’s data pipeline. For example, if a firm wants to:Airflow makes sure each step runs in the right order, handles failures, retries automatically, and logs everything.It’s widely used across tech, finance, healthcare, and retail.Astronomer didn’t invent Airflow—but it has become the leading commercial company that packages, manages, and scales it for enterprises.Airflow is free, but running it reliably across a large company is not. That’s where Astronomer’s platform Astro comes in. It offers:Companies like Apple, Stripe, Bloomberg and dozens of Fortune 500 firms now use Astronomer to manage their data pipelines.Modern businesses run on data. Whether it’s Netflix recommending your next show, a bank flagging fraud, or a health app warning about irregular heart rhythms—data needs to flow, cleanly and reliably.Astronomer ensures that happens. Without tools like Astro, companies would have to spend millions building in-house systems to handle the same problems. And without clean, well-managed data, AI models produce garbage, apps break, and decision-making falters.Is Astronomer a space tech company?No. It works with data, not planets. The name is metaphorical—think mapping vast digital universes.What is data orchestration?The process of scheduling, coordinating, and automating how data flows between systems—like ETL, but more intelligent and flexible.What is Astro?Astro is Astronomer’s cloud platform that runs and manages Apache Airflow for enterprises.What kind of companies use Astronomer?Tech firms, banks, retailers, media companies, and more—anyone with complex data pipelines.Why was Astronomer in the news?Its CEO Andy Byron and HR head Kristin Cabot were seen on the Kiss Cam at a Coldplay concert. The video raised questions about workplace ethics and corporate culture—especially ironic for a company that sells itself on reliability and control.Astronomer doesn’t build rockets, but it helps companies launch and maintain something just as mission-critical: the smooth, timely flow of data. And as AI becomes more ubiquitous, the systems that feed it—quiet, backend tools like Astro—are becoming some of the most important software in the world.The Coldplay scandal may fade. But Astronomer’s role in the AI economy is only growing.","Astronomer is a tech company that helps large organisations manage and automate their data workflows.

The sale includes 10 operational wind assets, though the deal value was not disclosed.“The onshore US wind business has great assets and fantastic people but we have concluded we are no longer the best owners to take it forward,” said William Lin, BP’s executive vice president for gas and low carbon energy, quoted AFP.Lin added that low-carbon energy will continue to have a place in BP’s simplified and more focused business model, but the company would keep rationalising its portfolio to create more value.LS Power CEO Paul Segal said the acquisition, expected to close by the end of 2025, would “help to meet growing energy demand across the US.”The move comes after BP, once seen as an industry leader in climate goals, reversed course in February by scaling back its emissions reduction targets and slashing its clean energy investments. It is now prioritising higher returns from oil and gas, under investor pressure to improve its share performance.As part of the revised strategy, BP plans to cut over $5 billion annually from clean energy spending and divest $20 billion in assets by 2027.BP's rival Shell has similarly pared back its climate ambitions in recent months.","BP to sell its entire onshore wind energy business in the United States to LS Power.

"'One of my worst appointments': Trump targets Fed Chair again, calls on 'too late, numbskull’ to lower rates",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/one-of-my-worst-appointments-trump-targets-fed-chair-again-calls-on-too-late-numbskull-to-lower-rates/articleshow/122766395.cms,"Can the president fire the fed chair?

US President Donald Trump has sharply intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of stalling the US housing market with high interest rates and hinting at possible dismissal over a controversial $2.5 billion renovation at the Fed's headquarters.In a pair of fiery Truth Social posts on Friday, Trump branded Powell a ""numbskull"" and ""one of my worst appointments,"" blaming him for keeping borrowing costs too high despite what Trump called “very low inflation” and a strong economy. ""He is truly one of my worst appointments. Sleepy Joe saw how bad he was and reappointed him anyway - And the Fed Board has done nothing to stop this “numbskull” from hurting so many people. In many ways the Board is equally to blame!"" said Trump in a post on Truth Social.“The USA is Rockin’. We deserve to be at 1%, saving one trillion dollars a year on interest costs,” Trump further added, urging Powell to “Lower the Rate, Too Late!” he added.The renewed tirade follows months of escalating tension between the White House and the independent central bank. Trump’s latest remarks go beyond monetary policy, raising questions about the legality and motivation behind the Federal Reserve’s multibillion-dollar renovation of its Washington, DC buildings.Trump has pointed to the rising cost of the project- now estimated between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion- as a possible avenue to remove Powell from office, even suggesting on Wednesday that “fraud” might be involved, reported AFP.In response, Powell sent a letter to White House budget director Russell Vought clarifying that there were no luxury features being added, such as VIP dining rooms or private elevators. He noted that the buildings required “significant structural repairs” and requested an independent review by the Fed’s inspector general.While Trump’s threats have stirred headlines, experts say removing a sitting Fed chair is far from straightforward. According to legal scholars, the president would need to show cause under federal law—such as “malfeasance,” “inefficiency,” or “neglect of duty”—to justify dismissal.“Right now, there’s no evidence that the White House has released publicly or pointed to that suggests mismanagement in connection with the renovation,” said Lev Menand, associate professor at Columbia Law School, quoted by AFP. “Based on publicly available information, there are no grounds for removing Powell ‘for cause’.”Any removal effort would require formal charges, a response from Powell, and a lengthy process that could further unsettle financial markets.Meanwhile, analysts warn that any attempt to forcibly remove Powell could trigger market volatility and shake investor confidence in the Fed’s independence. “Equities would likely sell off on impact,” said Padhraic Garvey of ING, as quoted by AFP. “This would be an effective forced exit of a reputable Fed chair by the US president, an unprecedented event for the market to get its head around,” he told AFP.However, some investors may eventually speculate that a leadership change could hasten interest rate cuts, potentially boosting stocks. But any quick monetary pivot remains uncertain, as the Federal Open Market Committee is composed of 12 voting members who independently weigh inflation and employment data.","US President Donald Trump has sharply intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Debt and shame: Why millions in China feel trapped and alone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/debt-and-shame-why-millions-in-china-feel-trapped-and-alone-despite-a-strong-economy/articleshow/122764778.cms,"TL;DR: Driving the news

China's economy grew at a 5.2% clip in Q2 2025 - faster than forecast and propped up by exports and subsidies. But a deeper look shows a troubling reality: millions of Chinese consumers are drowning in personal debt, clinging to side jobs, and quietly unraveling under financial pressure.

Many have stopped spending. Some are documenting their ruin online. Others are considering suicide.

“I can only endure. I don’t dare to quit,” Frank Huang, a 28-year-old teacher in Chongzuo, Guangxi, told Reuters. His salary hasn’t been paid in months, and he relies on his parents to survive. “If I were married with a mortgage, car loan and child, the pressure would be unimaginable.”

The government, on its part, has responded with $42 billion in subsidies and vague promises of reform. But the emotional toll is becoming as destabilizing as the economic one.

Why it matters

“In China, we generally don’t tell our parents about bad news,” Ms Bai, a former education executive whose business collapsed after the crackdown on tutoring told the Economist.

“So they were very, very affected.”

The big picture

The Chinese dream - built on homeownership, job security, and rising wealth - is cracking under pressure.

What began as a property-driven middle-class boom now looks like a debt trap:

65% of all household loans in China are mortgages, often for properties that have plummeted in value since the real estate crash.

Job insecurity is rampant, especially for younger and lower-income workers. State firms are slashing wages, and teachers are going unpaid for months.

China’s long-promised shift to a consumption-driven economy is being smothered by inaction and intimidation.

“Rather than just being short of money, people tend to compare and make choices with more consideration,” Zhan Demi, who used subsidies to upgrade her home appliances - and then immediately cut back, told the New York Times.

Between the lines: A culture of silent distress

Behind the GDP growth and flashy subsidy campaigns is a culture of silent distress.

Side hustles are survival, not ambition. Zhang Jinming, an employee at a state-run real estate firm, now delivers food every night to make up for a 24% pay cut. “There’s just no other way,” he told Reuters.

Aggressive debt collectors, known as cuigou or “pressure dogs,” bombard friends and family.

Call-blocking is futile. Harassment is constant.

Legal options are scarce.

Personal bankruptcy laws exist in theory - but only 10% of applications in Shenzhen, the only city with such a law, have been accepted since 2021.

The emotional toll is massive. Bai, the ex-entrepreneur, considered suicide after her husband divorced her and she was blacklisted from high-speed trains and hotels.

“The pay cut has put me under huge pressure. Many colleagues have resigned, and I took over their workload,” Zhang told Reuters.

Zoom in: The 'Debt IP' phenomenon

What they’re saying

In Linquan, a rural county of 1.5 million in eastern China, a teacher who gave only her surname, Yun, said she is now receiving just her basic monthly salary of 3,000 yuan, with the performance-based portion—typically about 16%—""consistently delayed."" “After I pay for gas, parking and property management fees, what’s left isn’t enough for groceries,” she told Reuters. “I feel like begging,” she added. “If it weren’t for my parents, I would starve.”

Max Zenglein, Asia-Pacific senior economist at the Conference Board of Asia, describes China as a “dual-speed economy,” marked by strong industrial output but weak consumer spending—two dynamics he says are closely linked. “Some of the economic challenges including low profitability and deflationary pressure are largely driven by continued capacity expansion in the manufacturing and technology sectors,” said Zenglein. As for the ongoing trade war with the US he added, “What’s unfolding now is coming back home as a domestic issue.”

Chinese officials are aware of the growing crisis - but they’re sending mixed signals. “We are still facing a very severe and complex situation,” Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said. “Our toolbox is plentiful, and we will be fully prepared.”

Premier Li Qiang has promised to “expand domestic demand” and “make China a megasized consumption powerhouse.”

Xi Jinping , too, has vowed to “fully unleash” consumer potential. But meaningful structural reforms - like a national personal bankruptcy law or a real welfare safety net - remain stalled.

, too, has vowed to “fully unleash” consumer potential. But meaningful structural reforms - like a national personal bankruptcy law or a real welfare safety net - remain stalled. Instead, the government is throwing money at the problem: In 2025, China doubled its subsidy pool to $42 billion, offering up to 20% off home appliances, cars, and smartphones.

That program sparked a brief consumption bump - May retail sales jumped 6.4%. But in June, growth slowed to 4.8%, disappointing expectations. Several municipalities, including Chongqing, have already paused the subsidies to avoid budget overruns.

Spending deferred, dreams deferred

The social toll of China's lopsided recovery - strong exports, weak consumption - is visible in everyday decisions:

Frank Huang, a teacher in Guangxi, hasn’t been paid in months. “If I were married with a mortgage, car loan and child, the pressure would be unimaginable,” he told Reuters.

Another teacher in Linquan says her performance bonuses are delayed. “After I pay for gas, parking and property management fees, what’s left isn’t enough for groceries,” she said.

Job seekers like Huang Tingting now face fierce competition. She quit her waitress job in April and hasn’t found another since June. “This year is worse than last year,” she said.

Even those benefiting from subsidies are cautious. Coffee is being brewed at home. Rent payments take priority over outings. And families are saving more - not spending more.

What’s next

For now, Beijing is vowing more stimulus and regulatory tightening, but consumer sentiment remains low. Zhan Demi, a mother in Tianjin, summed it up: “Many people are even unemployed, or they are forced to stop working, or their salaries are cut. Rather than just being short of money, people tend to compare and make choices with more consideration,” Zhan told the NYT.

Across cities and countryside alike, middle-class families once lauded as China’s growth engine now wrestle with mounting debt, shrinking paychecks, and the erosion of hope.Debt is no longer just an economic metric in China - it's a psychological burden reshaping the social fabric.* Over 60 million Chinese adults are in default or behind on payments, according to Gavekal Dragonomics. That’s 5–7% of the population over 15.* Household debt has skyrocketed from 11% of GDP in 2006 to over 60% in 2025, nearing rich-world levels.* Social shame around money trouble means many suffer in silence - or fall into what researchers call *shesi*, or “social death.”In a country where discussing personal failure is taboo, some are breaking the silence - for survival.A growing class of micro-influencers is monetizing personal debt on social media. They record their fall from financial grace, detail harassment from collectors, and even mock their own poor decisions.Lily, a young woman in Shanghai who films her debt struggles to make ends meet on social media, owes 30,000 yuan ($4,200) and posts short videos chronicling her situation. “I haven’t hit the big time,” she told the Economist, but others have. Popular accounts now boast hundreds of thousands of followers.“Some people are even competing: ‘Oh, I’m 10 million in debt, I’m 100 million in debt,’” Lily said.This genre - sometimes dubbed “debt IP” - is part support group, part spectacle. But it's also a cry for help that the government isn't fully addressing.A personal bankruptcy law might offer relief, but only Shenzhen has a version in place-and courts reject 90% of applications. Meanwhile, online loan sharks thrive in the legal gray zones, and structural reforms to support household consumption remain sluggish. According to Capital Economics, consumer prices fell for four consecutive months this year, a warning sign of deepening deflation.Even growth data is under question. Some analysts, like Zichun Huang at Capital Economics, estimate actual GDP growth could be closer to 3.5% for 2025-not the officially reported 5.2%.The numbers may still look strong. But for tens of millions of Chinese citizens, the story is no longer one of growth. It’s one of survival.(With inputs from agencies)","China's economy grew at a 5.2% clip in Q2 2025 - faster than forecast and propped up by exports and subsidies. Millions of Chinese consumers are drowning in personal debt, clinging to side jobs, and quietly unraveling under financial pressure. Many have stopped spending. Some are documenting their ruin online. Others are considering suicide.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122765692,imgsize-570330,width-400,resizemode-4/122765692.jpg"
"Sanctions on Russia: EU unveils strongest measures yet; oil cap lowered, shadow fleet hit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/sanctions-on-russia-eu-unveils-strongest-measures-yet-oil-cap-lowered-shadow-fleet-hit/articleshow/122755115.cms,"The EU on Friday unveiled one of its most powerful sanctions against Russia, since the beginning of its war with Ukraine which is now in its fourth year.The sanctions include a reduced oil price cap, a ban on dealings linked to the Nord Stream gas pipelines, and fresh action against Russia’s shadow fleet of vessels, according to EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.This move comes as European nations move to buy weapons from the US to help Ukraine better defend itself.The new measures include a reduction in the oil price cap from $60 to $45 per barrel, a ban on transactions involving the Nord Stream gas pipelines, and an expansion of restrictions on Russia’s so-called shadow fleet of tankers. Over 100 additional ships have been added to the EU's blacklist.“The message is clear: Europe will not back down in its support for Ukraine. The EU will keep raising the pressure until Russia ends its war,” Kallas was qyoted as saying by AP.The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, had initially proposed the lowered oil price cap to squeeze Russia’s energy revenues, a major financial lifeline for the Kremlin. Oil income continues to underpin Russia’s economy, funding its military operations while helping President Vladimir Putin avoid domestic inflation spikes and a currency collapse.Although a $60 per barrel cap was previously imposed in 2023 by Ukraine’s Western allies, it had little practical effect at the time, as most of Moscow’s crude sold below that threshold. However, the EU sees the lowered $45 cap as a renewed attempt to dent Russian finances more substantially.The EU had sought to align the cap with the broader G7 bloc to maximise pressure, but rising global oil prices, fuelled in part by conflict in the Middle East, and the absence of support from the Trump administration hindered those efforts.In a significant step, the EU also moved to block any future revenue from the Nord Stream gas pipelines linking Russia and Germany, despite the fact they are no longer operational. The pipelines were the target of a major sabotage incident in 2022, the origins of which remain unresolved.To further tighten the financial noose, the sanctions package also targets Russia’s banking sector, aiming to limit Moscow’s ability to raise capital and carry out international transactions. Two Chinese banks were included among the entities sanctioned.Russian oil giant Rosneft’s refinery in India was also hit by the new measures, part of a broader effort to curb the Kremlin’s energy partnerships beyond Europe.Sanctions have been piling up since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. So far, over 2,400 individuals and entities, ranging from government officials and banks to companies and organisations, have faced EU asset freezes and travel bans.However, reaching agreement on each successive round of sanctions is becoming more difficult. The latest package faced opposition from Slovakia, which relies heavily on Russian gas and raised concerns about further supply cuts.The previous round of sanctions, announced on 20 May, blacklisted nearly 200 vessels suspected of helping Russia sidestep existing restrictions. With Friday’s update, more than 100 additional ships have been added to the list, signalling Europe’s intent to cut off Russia’s alternative trade routes.","The new measures include a reduction in the oil price cap from $60 to $45 per barrel.

TSMC's global expansion: Eyes Arizona as global semiconductor hub; planning to establish a global gigafab cluster,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tsmcs-global-expansion-eyes-arizona-as-global-semiconductor-hub-planning-to-establish-a-global-gigafab-cluster/articleshow/122740562.cms,"Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC is accelerating its US expansion, stepping up the construction of its second and third chip fabrication plants in Arizona as part of plans to build a massive “gigafab” cluster in the state, as per a report by Focus Taiwan.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) is advancing its strategy to meet increasing global demand for advanced semiconductors used in smartphones, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-performance computing (HPC).At an investor conference on Thursday, TSMC chairman CC Wei highlighted Arizona’s growing strategic importance within the company’s global operations. He said the state is set to become a critical hub for TSMC’s most advanced manufacturing technologies.The company’s first Arizona fab began mass production in the fourth quarter of 2024, using 4-nanometre process technology. Wei further stated that the facility’s yield rate is already on par with TSMC’s similar fabs in Taiwan.Construction of the second Arizona fab, which will produce 3nm chips, the most advanced node currently deployed in Taiwan, has been completed. Due to strong customer demand, production is now scheduled to commence several quarters ahead of the original timeline.Meanwhile, groundwork has begun for a third fab in the state, which will use 2nm and A16 process technologies. Wei confirmed that demand for AI-related chips remains particularly robust.TSMC’s total investment across the three Arizona fabs stands at $65 billion. The company has also pledged an additional $100 billion over the next few years to deepen its US presence. This includes plans for three more fabs, two integrated circuit (IC) assembly plants, and a dedicated research and development centre.These projects are expected to transform Arizona into a self-sustaining semiconductor manufacturing hub, with the state’s facilities eventually accounting for roughly 30% of TSMC’s most advanced chip production, those using 2nm and newer technologies.TSMC’s global expansion plans extend beyond the US. In Japan, its first fab in Kumamoto began mass production in late 2024, producing chips using 12nm, 16nm, and 28nm processes. A second fab, originally scheduled to break ground in early 2025 and begin operations in late 2027, will manufacture 6nm, 7nm, and 40nm chips.However, Wei noted a slight delay in the project due to traffic infrastructure issues. Construction is now expected to start later this year, depending on local progress.In Germany, TSMC is also progressing smoothly with the construction of a fabrication facility in Dresden, which will focus on specialty semiconductor technologies.Back in Taiwan, the company continues its major domestic expansion. It plans to build 11 new wafer fabs and four advanced IC assembly facilities over the coming years. Current projects in Hsinchu and Kaohsiung are scheduled to begin mass production using 2nm process technology later this year.Despite the ambitious overseas expansion, TSMC’s chief financial officer Wendell Huang cautioned that the company will face short-term financial pressures. He projected a 2–3 percentage point dip in gross margins initially, with a broader 3–4 percentage point decline expected over the next five years due to the higher operating costs associated with international sites.","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

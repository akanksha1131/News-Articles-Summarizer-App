Ensuring Retirement Products Compete on Merit

Encouraging Long-Term Wealth Building Through Parity

Enhancing Affordability of Social and Rural Insurance through Stamp Duty Reforms

As India charts its economic course for the coming year, the insurance sector remains a key pillar in household financial planning and risk mitigation. Recent regulatory efforts and initiatives have supported sectoral growth, yet broad measures of insurance engagement show there is still significant ground to cover. According to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s annual report, India’s overall insurance penetration stood at 3.7 percent of GDP in FY24, with life insurance coverage at 2.8 percent. This level remains below the global average of over 7 percent. As per a PwC India report on insurance inclusion, in rural India, where around 65 percent of the population resides, less than 10 percent of people have life insurance coverage.These insights serve as a reminder that despite progress, access to financial protection is still limited for large sections of the population. With this context, the upcoming Budget offers an opportunity to strengthen policy support. My recommendations below aim to enhance customer outcomes, improve long term savings participation, and support national goals of financial inclusion and resilience.India’s pension ecosystem continues to face a significant coverage gap.While the National Pension System and other formal pension schemes continue to expand, India's formal pension coverage remains below 25% of the workforce according to the Mercer-CFA Institute Global Pension Index 2025. The report ranks the country 45th out of 47 nations for pension adequacy. Life insurance annuity products and the National Pension System both aim to support retirement income, yet their tax treatment differs considerably.Insurance annuity payouts are taxed on the full amount, including the principal that has already been taxed during the earning years. NPS subscribers, on the other hand, receive additional deductions for self-contribution and employer contribution. This difference in treatment often influences consumer decisions more than product suitability.A more aligned and tax efficient framework across financial products, for example taxing only the returns on annuity payouts and extending comparable deductions to insurance annuity pension products, would allow individuals to choose based on their long term needs rather than tax benefits. Such alignment would encourage more Indians to build structured retirement plans.Over the last few years, high-value traditional insurance policies have received different treatment. For example, for all policies whose annual aggregate premium is higher than Rs. 5 lakh, the maturity proceeds are now taxed at regular income tax rates. These policies, which provide significant life cover in addition to disciplined wealth accumulation, started to be considered less attractive when compared to other alternatives of investment.Meanwhile, high-value Unit Linked insurance policies, whose annual aggregate premium is higher than Rs. 2.5 lakh premium get long-term capital gains treatment, usually more generous and tax efficient. Therefore, introducing similar tax treatment of capital gain on high-value traditional insurance policies as well and bringing both to the same tax treatment would create consistency, simplify the tax code, and encourage more people-particularly business owners, double-income families, and senior professionals to combine protection with savings.As insurance companies strive to meet rural coverage requirements, affordability becomes crucial. Even modest transaction costs such as stamp duty can influence pricing for low ticket products. Exempting rural and social sector policies from stamp duty, similar to the exemption already provided under PMJJBY, would help improve affordability and support deeper penetration.Life insurance can play an important role in shaping India’s long-term financial resilience. While the sector has made progress in expanding access and adapting to changing customer needs, data shows that penetration and coverage gaps persist. Thoughtful policy changes in the upcoming budget can support a more efficient, equitable, and inclusive insurance ecosystem.In the end, financial security should not remain a privilege of a few but be strengthened as a shared foundation for every household.","India’s pension ecosystem continues to face a significant coverage gap.

ITR filing: Why are taxpayers getting messages from Income Tax Department on claims?

Why are taxpayers getting intimations?

What is the department asking taxpayers to do?



Why are refunds being delayed for some?



What happens if the intimation is ignored

ITR filing FY 2024-25: The Income Tax Department on Tuesday issued a press release clarifying why several taxpayers have received emails and SMS alerts seeking a review of their tax deduction and exemption claims.The department urged taxpayers to review their deduction and exemption claims for the current assessment year and take corrective steps before the revised deadline of December 31 to avoid penalties or further scrutiny.According to the release, advanced risk analytics under its risk management framework have flagged certain Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for Assessment Year 2025-26.These include cases where deductions or exemptions appear to be ineligible, such as claims related to bogus donations to Registered Unrecognised Political Parties (RUPPs).The department also observed errors in some returns, including incorrect or invalid PAN details of donees and discrepancies in the amount of deductions or exemptions claimed.Taxpayers are being contacted via SMS and email under the department’s NUDGE (Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable) campaign. They are advised to review their returns and file revised ITRs, if required, by December 31, to avoid further enquiries.The Income Tax Department said the initiative reflects a “trust-first” approach, which gives taxpayers an opportunity to voluntarily correct mistakes instead of facing immediate enforcement action.Taxpayers are advised to verify their deduction and exemption claims using supporting documents and reconcile details with Form 16, Form 26AS, the Annual Information Statement (AIS) and the Taxpayer Information Summary (TIS). If errors are found, they should revise their returns within the prescribed timeline.Those whose claims are genuine and legally correct do not need to take any further action, the department clarified.The department added that taxpayers who miss the December 31 deadline may still file an updated return from January 1, 2026, as permitted under the law, though this would involve payment of additional tax.During FY 2025-26, more than 21 lakh taxpayers have already updated their ITRs for assessment years ranging from 2021-22 to 2024-25, paying over Rs 2,500 crore in taxes. For the current assessment year (AY 2025-26), over 15 lakh returns have already been revised.Several salaried taxpayers, particularly those under the old tax regime, have reported receiving intimations stating that their refund processing has been temporarily put on hold due to discrepancies in deduction claims.Tax experts say many such cases involve deductions like Sections 80C, 80D or HRA that were claimed directly in the ITR but were not declared to employers during TDS calculations.Chartered accountants have clarified that this does not automatically make a taxpayer non-compliant, as the Income Tax Act allows eligible deductions to be claimed directly while filing returns, even if they were not considered by the employer.Experts warn that ignoring such communications can have consequences. If discrepancies are not addressed, the department may disallow the deductions, leading to additional tax demand, interest, penalties, delay or cancellation of refunds and even detailed scrutiny or assessment.Tax professionals advise taxpayers not to panic but to promptly review their returns and respond appropriately to avoid future complications.",The Income Tax Department on Tuesday issued a press release clarifying why several taxpayers have received emails and SMS alerts.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

Government has begun discussions with WhatsApp after the messaging app banned a high number of Indian accounts, raising concerns over the continued misuse of Indian mobile numbers for online fraud.According to people familiar with the matter, WhatsApp has been blocking an average of 9.8 million Indian accounts every month until October this year for violations of its policies. While the Meta-owned platform publishes monthly figures on such actions, authorities said that the absence of details about the mobile numbers linked to these accounts is making it harder to track spam, scams and cyber fraud, ET reported citing officials.India is WhatsApp’s largest market, and officials said the platform’s refusal to share even basic information about banned numbers is limiting the government’s ability to verify whether those numbers are genuine or fraudulently obtained. WhatsApp categorises Indian accounts using the +91 country code and said that its bans are triggered by behavioural signals that indicate policy breaches, including suspected involvement in scams.Government officials noted that banned numbers frequently reappear on other over-the-top (OTT) platforms, particularly Telegram, where they continue to be used for fraudulent activities. The wider misuse of Indian mobile numbers, by actors both within the country and abroad, remains a serious challenge, despite multiple enforcement measures.In most cases, fraudsters operate through OTT messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram. Once an account is created using a mobile number, these apps can function without a SIM card, making it extremely difficult for enforcement agencies to trace offenders, officials said. They added that about 95% of digital arrest and impersonation cases are carried out on WhatsApp.“There are concerns around how Indian numbers are being used (by fraudsters) and we are addressing those issues,” one official was quoted by ET as saying.“We have to balance convenience against security implications.”Officials said tracing when a SIM card was issued and verifying whether the know-your-customer (KYC) details linked to it are genuine or fake is central to curbing such fraud. “We are talking to WhatsApp and other OTTs as to how to deal with this problem,” the official added.Separately, the government routinely asks WhatsApp and other digital platforms to block accounts found to be involved in scams or illegal activities. Data from the Department of Telecommunications shows that nearly 2.9 million WhatsApp profiles and groups were disengaged following government directions until November this year.While authorities are informed about accounts removed on official instructions, they say there is little visibility when WhatsApp independently bans accounts. The platform discloses only aggregate numbers in its reports, without specifying which mobile numbers have been disabled.“As WhatsApp does not coordinate with respective authorities concerning the banned accounts, there is no clarity as to what numbers have been banned,” another official said. “We don’t want any private details of the person, just the numbers which have been banned, so that it can be checked if the number is genuine or not.”Rakesh Maheshwari, former senior director at the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY), said the purpose of monthly compliance reports was to improve platform accountability. “The whole intent of initiating this monthly compliance report and sharing it with the public was meant to bring in transparency and accountability of the platforms,” he said. “Now, if there are certain revelations which require deeper introspection, the government has further right to seek more information. ”WhatsApp has said that because its service is protected by end-to-end encryption, account enforcement relies on platform-specific behavioural indicators. It has also cited technical, legal and cross-border challenges in sharing detailed account information.“There are a number of aspects concerning banning of accounts and not all are security aspects. Some of them are based on complaints. However, sometimes they refuse to share details, which is a security concern,” a third official said.","Government has begun discussions with WhatsApp after the messaging app banned a high number of Indian accounts.

Japan govt approves record 122 trillion yen budget,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japan-govt-approves-record-122-trillion-yen-budget/articleshow/126182024.cms,"(Photo credit: AP)

The Japanese government on Friday approved a record budget for the upcoming fiscal year, to pay for everything from bigger defence spending to ballooning social security costs as inflation persists.The 122.3-trillion-yen ($782 billion) budget for the fiscal year from April 2026 will include some nine trillion yen for defence spending, as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi aims to accelerate Tokyo's sweeping upgrade of its military in the face of worsening relations with China.The defence ministry said in a briefing document that ""Japan faces the most severe and complex security environment since the end of the war,"" stressing the need to ""fundamentally strengthen"" its defence capabilities.At the core of its request is 100 billion yen for the so-called SHIELD coastal defence system, which would marshal drones to block any invasion by foreign troops.Japan is hoping that SHIELD -- Synchronised, Hybrid, Integrated and Enhanced Littoral Defence -- will be completed by March 2028, with no details yet on which part of Japan's coastline it will be linked to.The 122-trillion-yen figure compares with the 115 trillion yen sought for the current fiscal year to March, which was also a record.The expanding budget comes as the market worries about Takaichi's big spending policies adding to Japan's public debts.Japan already has the biggest ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) among major economies, projected to reach 232.7 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Earlier this month parliament approved a massive extra budget, to pay for a 21.3-trillion-yen stimulus announced a month earlier.The market has reacted by driving down the value of the yen while the benchmark yield rose for Japanese government bonds.Some observers have drawn comparisons to the UK's 2022 bond market turmoil under then-premier Liz Truss.Takaichi has advocated big government spending to spur economic growth.""What Japan needs right now is not the undermining of our strength as a nation through excessive austerity fiscal policies, but rather the bolstering of our national strength through proactive fiscal policies,"" she told a press conference last week.In an interview Tuesday with the influential Nikkei business daily, Takaichi stressed her commitment to Tokyo's fiscal health, rejecting any ""irresponsible bond issuance or tax cuts.""The current size of the budget is unlikely to shock the bond market, Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a note ahead of Friday.But an increase to around 125 trillion yen or more, he said, would cause the ""turmoil in the bond market, already in crisis mode, to deepen further"".Kiuchi noted that, under Takaichi, the extra budget quickly ballooned, reaching $18 trillion yen.""Financial markets are likely on high alert for a similar occurrence. Should the fall of the yen and bond prices further accelerate due to the size of the budget, it would increase worries about adverse effects on the economy and people's lives.""A weaker yen raises prices of imports for resource-poor Japan, which relies heavily on foreign food, energy and raw materials to power its economy.Takaichi came to power in October with a pledge to fight inflation after anger over rising prices. Another challenge facing the country is its ageing population, caused by chronically low birth rates and a cautious approach to immigration. The draft budget needs to be approved by parliament.",The 122.3-trillion-yen budget for the fiscal year from April 2026 will include some nine trillion yen for defence spending.

Benchmark indices extended their phase of consolidation for the fourth consecutive week, reflecting a period of digestion after the recent uptrend. During the previous week, the Nifty traded within a defined range but maintained a positive bias, ultimately closing near the 26,150 mark. The recovery during the week was largely supported by favourable global cues, as softer-than-expected US inflation data boosted global risk sentiment and encouraged buying interest across equities.Looking ahead, we anticipate the Nifty to continue consolidating within the broader range of 25,700–26,300 in the near term. The index remains at an important juncture, and a decisive move beyond this range is likely to set the tone for the next directional trend.A sustained breakout above 26,300 on a closing basis would be a key technical trigger, potentially opening the door for further upside towards the 26,500 zone in the coming sessions.On the downside, immediate support is placed near the 26,000 level, which coincides with Monday’s gap-up area and may act as a short-term demand zone. Below this, a strong support band exists in the 25,700–25,800 range, aligning with the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), the lows of the past two weeks, and an important retracement level of the prior uptrend.Holding above this support zone will be critical to preserve the positive momentum built over the last three months and maintain the broader bullish structure.Bank Nifty traded in a range, digesting its recent strong gains. The index consolidated in a 1500 points range in the last 4 weeks, oscillating in a positive and negative territory.We expect the index to extend consolidation and form a base in the range of 58500-60100 in the coming weeks.A strength above last week’s high of 59,533 will open further upside towards 60,400 levels in the coming weeks.The entire up move of the last 2 months is well channeled, signaling sustained demand at elevated levels. Key support is placed at 58,300-58,600 levels, being the confluence of the 50 day EMA and recent breakout area. Holding above the support area will keep the short-term bias positive.Lloyds Metals and Energy has delivered a clear breakout above the falling channel that had contained prices over the past six months. This move signals a reversal of the corrective trend and highlights a renewed bullish setup, opening up a fresh entry opportunity from a positional perspective.Going forward, we expect stocks to maintain a positive bias and gradually move toward the ₹1,523 level, which corresponds to the 80% Fibonacci retracement of the broader decline from ₹1,612 to ₹1,170Kotak Mahindra Bank has recently witnessed a decisive breakout above its prolonged 5-year consolidation range of ₹1,600–₹2,000, marking a clear improvement in its long-term price structure. This breakout indicates a structural turnaround following an extended phase of sideways movement and reflects strengthening momentum along with renewed investor confidence.Going ahead, the stock is likely to maintain a positive bias and gradually trend higher over the next year. Based on the measured move implication of the 5-year range breakout (₹2,400–₹2,000), we expect Kotak Mahindra Bank to advance toward the ₹2,400 level, making the broader outlook constructive from a medium- to long-term perspective.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for December 26, 2025 are.

US investors may soon have access to a greater array of products tied to asset classes like private credit and crypto as the Trump administration and SEC push to open markets, a change that some investment advisors say puts too much onus on individuals to protect themselves.Both the White House and the Securities and Exchange Commission, under Chair Paul Atkins, have embraced offering investors more choice in order to tap into some asset classes that can offer high returns.

He added that this is where India’s strength lies and where new AI-driven job opportunities will emerge.“For India, where the number of white-collar jobs relative to other jobs is much lower than in the West, this risk to cognitive jobs, I don’t think, is as serious as it is in other places. Also, the fact that most of our white-collar jobs are in the Stem space means we have an opportunity,” Krishnan said.Krishnan pointed out that AI is the first technology to pose a risk for knowledge workers and cognitive labour, as opposed to industrial and other revolutions in the past that replaced manual labour with machines. Krishnan said while some may believe AI will eliminate the need for workers entirely, he disagrees.“I personally don’t think we’ll reach that stage in such a hurry. What it (AI) would do is enhance human capability (such) that you can be much more productive in your cognitive tasks and have access to the resources,” he said.","India faces a lower risk of AI-driven disruption to cognitive jobs compared to Western economies, IT secretary S Krishnan has said.

MUMBAI: Never mind Delhi's winter or Mumbai's traffic, Indians are feasting this festive season and raising a toast to the last few days of the year.There has been a rush of advance bookings at several restaurants, with seats at some of the eateries totally sold out for Christmas and New Year's eve. After a somewhat slow start to Dec, brands are hoping to conduct brisk year-end business.""We are sold out (for Christmas) across cities and formats (different store formats across different brands). For Dec 31st too, we are totally sold out everywhere,"" said Zorawar Kalra, founder at Massive Restaurants, which owns brands such as Farzi Cafe and Pa Pa Ya.The company has hired additional staff for this period to help with the surge in consumer footfalls, said Kalra. Gauri Devidayal, co-founder and director at Food Matters Group which runs The Table in Mumbai's Colaba has been flooded with last-minute requests for reservations through the ongoing season.""Business this Dec is definitely doing better than last year,"" said Devidayal. Kolkata-based Chowman is expecting double-digit growth this season over last year on the back of higher order values and expansion into more cities.Advance bookings across Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru have been strong for the brand. Dine-in reservations started filling up five to seven days in advance, said MD Debaditya Chaudhury.The festival heavy Oct-Dec period during which discretionary spends go up is usually the busiest season for restaurants. ""For Christmas eve, we saw an 18%-20% increase in footfalls compared to last year, driven by guests choosing to step out and celebrate together.Overall, based on the trends we're seeing, we do expect higher footfalls and stronger business this festive season compared to last year,"" said Divya Aggarwal, chief growth officer at Impresario Entertainment & Hospitality which runs Social and Smoke House Deli restaurants.Anurag Katriar, founder and MD at Indigo Hospitality which owns brands such as Indigo Delicatessen said that revenues may see a modest increase over last year given the good advance bookings and decent business on Christmas eve. ""We are seeing more business at the stores for sure. Special festive related deliveries for things like Turkey saw a surge,"" said Katriar.What has also helped restaurants cash in on late night cravings is the growth of food delivery apps which has given rise to the culture of ordering in. Besides, some restaurants have also built their own in-house delivery fleet.""The festive season has clearly blurred the line-celebration now happens both at table and on the couch. While dine-ins are strong, especially for Christmas eve and Christmas Day, delivery continues to dominate in absolute numbers, driven by house parties and late-night orders,"" said Chaudhury.Some companies such as Massive Restaurants, though, see bulk of its sales come from its stores.","There has been a rush of advance bookings at several restaurants, with seats at some of the eateries totally sold out for Christmas and New Year's eve.

Weight-loss therapy set to push pharma growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/weight-loss-therapy-set-to-push-pharma-growth/articleshow/126181140.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Once relegated to the fringes of lifestyle care, obesity drugs have emerged as one of the world's most powerful growth sectors, ranked by McKinsey alongside AI, EVs and robotics as trillion-dollar opportunities by 2040. In India, the surge in the weight-loss and metabolic therapy market is set to shape pharma's growth narrative in 2026 as affordable generics loom.Rising AI adoption across drug discovery will accelerate innovation and shorten time-to-market, while certain companies pivot from simple to niche and complex generics.Says Kirti Ganorkar, MD Sun Pharma : ""With lifestyle diseases on the rise, there is a growing need for holistic, patient-centric solutions. Wider access to GLP-1 medicines (glucagon-like peptide-1) for obesity and diabetes will help reduce the burden of these conditions.''Winselow Tucker, president and GM, Eli Lilly and Co (India) said: ""India is entering a transformative phase in obesity and chronic weight-management care, driven by a rising disease burden, greater recognition of obesity as a chronic disease, and broader access to evidence-based prescription therapies.Recent industry developments underscore strong patient demand and an expanding range of treatment options aimed at improving access and outcomes. ''With nearly 100 million adults living with diabetes and rising obesity-linked conditions, India's anti-obesity market, valued at just over Rs 1,000 crore (MAT Nov), has grown nearly 10-fold in five years. Blockbuster therapies - Wegovy and Mounjaro, marketed by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly respectively, were launched at ""India-specific prices'' earlier this year, while global bestseller Ozempic recently made its India debut.""Despite rising demand, India's obesity market remains largely under-penetrated, offering significant headroom for both innovators and generic entrants,"" Sheetal Sapale, vice-president (commercial) at Pharmarack said.Entry of low-priced generics from March after semaglutide (key ingredient in the blockbuster weight-loss jab) loses patent protection, along with potential price cuts by innovators, is expected to further accelerate growth in the fastest growing therapy.Bhanu Prakash Kalmath SJ, healthcare industry leader, Grant Thornton Bharat adds: ""The focus is clearly moving toward drugs such as GLP-1 therapies, alongside digital health solutions and preventive lifestyle programmes. In near-term, deeper partnerships among pharma companies, consumer health players and digital platforms are expected to play a role in improving access beyond major urban centres.''In parallel, companies are ramping up AI-led investments across the value chain to boost R&D productivity, improve efficiency and sharpen commercial outcomes.Says Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, executive chairperson, Biocon: ""The convergence of AI and digital technologies and personalised medicine will accelerate innovation. At the same time, India's emerging ecosystem for affordable cell and gene therapies is opening new frontiers in advanced care, strengthening its position as a global innovation hub. The continued expansion of biosimilars and complex biologics will further democratise access to cutting-edge treatments worldwide, while the rapid growth of CRDMOs will establish India as a preferred destination for high-value outsourcing in an era of supply-chain reconfiguration. ''Domestic pharma is scaling up R&D, particularly for advanced biologics, GLs, antibody-drug conjugate, cell and gene therapies, and pivoting from simple to complex generics, according to Srikanth Mahadevan, director, Deloitte India.Further, ""private equity interest will remain a dominant theme for healthcare providers, particularly hospitals, medical services and digital health. At the same time, there is a growing push towards non-US markets to diversify risk and reduce reliance on the US generics business,"" Sujay Shetty, global health industries advisory leader, PwC India says.","Once relegated to the fringes of lifestyle care, obesity drugs have emerged as one of the world's most powerful growth sectors.

PAN-Aadhaar Deadline Nears: How To Link Before December 31 Or Risk Inoperative PAN From Next Year

How To Link PAN With Aadhaar Card: Step-By-Step Guide

To begin with, you will have to pay a mandatory fee through the Income Tax Department’s e-Filing portal.

Visit the portal homepage (https://www.incometax.gov.in/iec/foportal/), select the Link Aadhaar option under Quick Links. Now enter your PAN card and Aadhaar card details.

After choosing to pay through e-Pay Tax, you are required to re-enter your PAN, verify your mobile number through an OTP, select the Income Tax option, and proceed to payment.

The assessment year must be selected and the payment category should be marked as Other Receipts (500). The Rs 1,000 amount is auto-filled and can be paid using net banking, debit card, or UPI. The payment may take four to five working days to reflect in the system.

Once the payment is confirmed (which can take a few days), taxpayers can make the linking request.

Go to the Link Aadhaar section, enter your PAN and Aadhaar details, and validate the information.

A confirmation message stating ""Your payment details are verified."" should appear, after which users must enter their name as per Aadhaar and their mobile number.

They are also required to confirm Aadhaar validation and indicate if only the year of birth is mentioned on their Aadhaar record.

The process is completed by entering the six-digit OTP sent to the registered mobile number.

Taxpayers can also check the status of their PAN-Aadhaar linkage without logging in. By selecting Link Aadhaar Status under Quick Links on the e-Filing homepage and entering PAN and Aadhaar details, users can view the current status. A successful linkage is indicated by a green checkmark, while pending cases will display a message stating that the request has been forwarded to UIDAI for validation.

The final date to complete your PAN–Aadhaar card linking is December 31, 2025. Beginning January 1, 2026, the Income Tax Department will declare all PANs that remain unlinked with Aadhaar card as inoperative.As per Notification No. 26/2025, issued on April 3, 2025, individuals who were allotted a PAN using an Aadhaar Enrolment ID before October 1, 2024 are required to complete the linkage using their permanent Aadhaar card number by the end of 2025. PAN cards that are not linked by the deadline will be marked inactive or inoperative and cannot be used for tax-related or major financial transactions, according to an ET report.The Central Board of Direct Taxes has cautioned that non-compliance will have financial consequences, including suspension of income tax refunds and the application of higher tax deduction at source rates from January 1, 2026.To complete the linkage, taxpayers must first ensure they have a valid PAN, an Aadhaar number, and a registered mobile phone to receive one-time passwords. A fee of Rs 1,000 is applicable in cases where the PAN was issued before July 1, 2017 and has not been linked earlier, the report said.","Taxpayers must first ensure they have a valid PAN, an Aadhaar number, and a registered mobile phone to receive one-time passwords.

Security forces attacked, senior officers injured

Land rights and Sixth Schedule at the core

Hunger strike, misinformation triggered violence

Talks announced, arson continues

Internet suspended to prevent escalation

CM monitors situation, appeals for calm

NEW DELHI: Violent protests over alleged illegal non tribal settlement in Assam’s constitutionally protected Karbi Anglong hill region entered the third day on Wednesday, leaving two people dead, dozens injured, and prompting the state government to impose curfew-like restrictions and suspend mobile internet services in two districts.The violence erupted in West Karbi Anglong and adjoining Karbi Anglong district after long simmering tensions over land rights escalated into clashes between tribal protesters and security forces. One tribal protester died in police action, while a non tribal man was killed in a fire that gutted several shops in Kheroni, a small trading town that has emerged as the epicentre of the unrest, police said.Assam DGP Harmeet Singh said 48 police personnel, including senior officers, were injured after protesters armed with bows, arrows, crude bombs and stones attacked security forces. The DGP and IGP Law and Order Akhilesh Kumar Singh were among those injured during the clashes.Police said protesters attempted to take control of a bridge in the area and turned violent when stopped.“Today, they tried to take over the bridge, and when we tried to stop them, they attacked us. Crude bombs and stones were thrown. I was attacked with bows and arrows,” Singh said, adding that the police have video footage and will take legal action against those responsible.The protests are rooted in opposition by the Karbi community to what they allege is illegal encroachment by non tribal settlers on professional grazing reserve and village grazing reserve lands.The districts fall under the Karbi Anglong autonomous council, governed by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which grants tribal regions autonomy over land, forests and local governance to protect indigenous communities.Residents have for over a year demanded eviction of alleged encroachers, saying unchecked settlement threatens tribal land rights.Tensions intensified after members of the Karbi community launched a hunger strike on December 6. The situation spiralled on Tuesday after police shifted some fasting protesters to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital due to deteriorating health.According to police, misinformation spread that a protest leader had been arrested, triggering anger and violence.“A huge crowd has gathered here since yesterday. I met the protestors and spoke with them. Last night, their leader was taken to Guwahati for a medical check-up as the doctors thought that his health was deteriorating because of the hunger strike. Still, someone spread misinformation that he is being arrested. Violence does not get anything for anybody,” DGP Harmeet Singh told reporters.State cabinet minister Ranoj Pegu, who met protesters at Kheroni earlier, said the group agreed to call off the hunger strike and participate in tripartite talks on December 26 involving the state government and the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council.“We assured the Karbi community that the government is serious about land rights and other tribal issues,” Pegu said, adding that discussions would address “broader issues related to existence of Karbi community.”Despite the assurance of talks, violence continued through the day, with shops and markets in Kheroni set ablaze. Police said a special investigation team has been formed and video footage is being examined to identify those involved in arson and attacks.In response to the deteriorating law and order situation, the Assam government on Tuesday ordered suspension of internet and mobile data services in Karbi Anglong and West Karbi Anglong districts with immediate effect.“It is, however, clarified that the voice calls and the broadband connectivity based on fixed telephone lines shall remain functional during this period. Any violation of the promulgation will be punishable under Section 223 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 and also under the relevant provision of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885,” said Biswajit Pegu, Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of Assam, Home and Political Department.The government said district magistrates warned that social media could be used to spread inflammatory messages and rumours, further aggravating tensions.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said he was closely monitoring the situation and announced deployment of additional forces in Kheroni, about 250 km east of Guwahati.“It is deeply painful that two persons lost their lives during today’s unrest,” Sarma said in a post on X, offering condolences to the families of the deceased and assuring all possible support.Authorities said efforts are under way to restore calm, urging community leaders to restrain youths and prevent further violence ahead of the scheduled talks later this week.","Violent protests over alleged illegal non tribal settlement in Assam’s constitutionally protected Karbi Anglong hill region enter third day.

What is NUDGE campaign?

ITR filing & Refunds: Why are taxpayers getting ‘nudges’?

What kind of exemptions and deductions are likely under scrutiny?

What should taxpayers do if they get a ‘nudge’ from tax authorities?

Amarpal Chadha shares a checklist:

Verify Deductions and Exemptions: Check all deductions and exemptions claimed in the income-tax return and ensure adequate documentation exists to substantiate each claim

Check all deductions and exemptions claimed in the income-tax return and ensure adequate documentation exists to substantiate each claim Identify Discrepancies: Compare the return filed with Form 16, bank statements, investment proofs, and other records to spot any discrepancies.

ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): The Income Tax Department is stepping up scrutiny for tax returns and income tax refund claims and many taxpayers are getting alerts to check their exemption and deduction claims. The last date to file income tax returns for FY 2024-25 was pushed to September 15, 2025 this year since the tax department took time to release forms and update the portal. However, the last date to file an updated or belated return for the current assessment year remains December 31, 2025.Several taxpayers are also facing delays in their returns and refunds being processed. Ahead of the important deadline, the Income Tax Department has issued a clarification on why some taxpayers are getting alerts to review their ITRs.The Income Tax Department has said that in the ongoing financial year 2025–26, over 21 lakh taxpayers have already updated their ITRs for AYs 2021–22 to 2024–25 and paid more than ₹2,500 crore in taxes. Also, over 15 lakh ITRs have been revised for the current assessment year.In a press release, the Income Tax Department has said that some taxpayers have claimed ‘ineligible’ refunds - through the deductions and exemptions route.This has led to their income being underreported.“Under the risk management framework, and through the use of advanced data analytics, cases for Assessment Year (AY) 2025–26 have been identified,” the Income Tax Department said.The tax department on its part is ‘nudging’ taxpayers to update their tax returns in case there is some discrepancy in the deductions and exemptions.Identified taxpayers are being sent SMS and email under the government’s “Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable (NUDGE)” campaign. The aim is to encourage these taxpayers to correct errors in tax return filing, ahead of the December 31, 2025 deadline.“This initiative reflects a trust-first approach to tax administration, under which taxpayers are provided an opportunity to review their Income-tax Returns (ITRs) and voluntarily correct any ineligible claims, wherever required,” the tax department said.“The campaign leverages data analytics and technology to enable a transparent, non-intrusive, and taxpayer-centric compliance environment, with an emphasis on guidance and voluntary compliance,” the department adds.The tax department has advised the concerned taxpayers to “review their ITRs, verify the correctness of their deduction and exemption claims, and revise their returns, if required, within the prescribed time by 31 December 2025, so as to avoid further enquiries in the matter.”Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner at EY India explains that the NUDGE campaign is an initiative of the Income Tax Department aimed at encouraging taxpayers to voluntarily review deduction or exemption claims that have been identified as potentially ineligible through data analytics.The Department is also leveraging global information-exchange frameworks such as the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI), Common Reporting Standards (CRS), and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) to identify possible discrepancies in foreign asset reporting, Chadha told TOI.Under the tax department’s initiative, taxpayers may receive an email or SMS explaining the reason for the communication and advising them to verify the accuracy of deductions or exemptions claimed, as well as the correctness of foreign asset disclosures. Where a taxpayer believes that corrective action is required, a revised return may be filed on or before December 31, 2025, which is the deadline for filing updated income tax returns for FY 2024-25Tanu Gupta, Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP has a clear message: In principle, all those exemptions and deductions which are not genuine are likely to come under scrutiny.“Even those deductions and exemptions which are inconsistent with the income tax department's records/information/data, may also come under scrutiny. The most sought-after deduction/exemption currently includes ""Donation to Political Parties"", ""House Rent Allowance"" to name a few,” she told TOI.According to Amarpal Chadha, any deduction that is claimed for donations to political parties where an incorrect or invalid PAN of the donee has been provided may come under the Income Tax Department’s scrutiny.The tax department has said that there are also cases where the taxpayers have given incorrect or invalid PAN details. Other cases pertain to the extent of deductions and exemptions that are being claimed by the taxpayers.“In addition, any deduction or exemption claimed in the income-tax return over and above what is reflected in Form 16 such as HRA exemption, exemptions under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), gratuity exemption etc. are also under tax department’s radar,” he told TOI.Tanu Gupta recommends that for all the claims including exemptions and deductions, the taxpayer should always keep in handy the following documents: receipts / invoices of the payments for which exemption / deduction is claimed, bank statement evidencing such payment through proper banking channels, receipts from the recipient to corroborate with such payments.These are broad guidelines for the documents which the taxpayer should anyway keep on files for a good financial housekeeping, she says.Is there a need for panic? No, says Tanu Gupta. “Instead, the taxpayer needs to revisit their claims of exemptions and deductions in the return and take action accordingly viz file the revised return if needed. As the name suggests, the abbreviation and the complete name of it (Non-Intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable), it is to facilitate the taxpayer to file compliant tax returns voluntarily, with correct, justified and genuine claims of deductions/exemptions,” she tells TOI.“There are cases where the taxpayers have received the communication from the department, although they believe that they do not have any inconsistency for the claims made in the return. They only need to see if they have all supporting documents for such payments to submit to the tax authorities when asked for,” explains Tanu Gupta, adding that wherever such exemptions / deductions are not authentic, the taxpayer needs to immediately revise the tax return by reversing such claims in the returns; and pay due income tax along with interest.If any claim or reporting needs correction, file a revised return within the prescribed timeline currently on or before December 31, 2025, he says.“However, if the taxpayer believes that the exemptions or deductions claimed are accurate and valid, they may wait for further communication from the Income Tax Department,” he adds.It is important to restate here that taxpayers do not have to worry where their tax claims are genuine.The Income Tax Department has clarified that taxpayers whose claims are genuine and correctly made in accordance with law are not required to take any further action.“It is clarified that taxpayers who do not avail of this opportunity may still file an updated return from 1 January 2026, as permitted under law, subject to payment of additional tax liability,” it has said.","Identified taxpayers are being sent SMS and email under the government’s ‘Non- intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable (NUDGE)’ campaign. The aim is to encourage these taxpayers to correct errors in tax return filing, ahead of the December 31, 2025 deadline.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126159165,imgsize-48186,width-400,resizemode-4/income-tax-return.jpg"
Ruble surges in 2025: Russian currency emerges as top performer against US dollar; why it's a headache for its war economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/russian-currency-ruble-emerged-as-the-top-performing-major-currency-against-the-us-dollar/articleshow/126177645.cms,"Representative image

The Russian currency Ruble emerged as the top-performing major currency against the US dollar this year, surging 45% since January. This unexpected strength caught Russian officials off guard and poses challenges for the country's war-affected economy. The currency is now trading around 78 per dollar, similar to levels before Russia's Ukraine invasion, as reported by Economic Times.The surge comes from several factors. Russians are buying less foreign currency due to international sanctions. High interest rates have also made ruble investments more attractive to locals. The central bank kept rates very high from October last year until June this year, before reducing them by 5 points to 16 per cent.This strong performance has exceeded government expectations, which predicted an average rate of 91.2 per dollar for the year. The ruble has stayed strong despite lower oil prices and new sanctions from the US and Europe. This strength is actually causing problems by reducing the value of export earnings when converted to rubles.The Bank of Russia has been supporting the currency by selling foreign currency, particularly yuan and gold, from the National Wellbeing Fund.This is helping offset declining energy revenues, with oil and gas income dropping 22% in the first 11 months of 2023.The ruble's impressive performance puts it among the world's top five performing assets this year, alongside precious metals like platinum, silver, palladium, and gold. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina sees this strength as helpful in fighting inflation, noting that its positive effects on prices haven't yet peaked.","The currency is now trading around 78 per dollar, similar to levels before Russia's Ukraine invasion.

A negative cycle

What's next?

Turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to help you stand out during the job process, but got rejected in the first round? Or are you a hiring manager who relied on AI to frisk through applications to select the best candidate, but ended up with not what you quite envisioned?The answer lies in the approach itself. Relying on artificial intelliegnce for job application might be doing you more harm than good.The growing use of artificial intelligence in recruitment is reshaping how Americans search for work, just as the country’s labour market shows signs of slowing. From automated interviews to AI-written cover letters, technology is now a part of almost every stage of the hiring process. But is it working?In 2025, more than half of organisations surveyed by the Society for Human Resource Management reported using AI tools to recruit workers. At the same time, almost one-third of ChatGPT users turned to the OpenAI chatbot for help with job applications. Yet recent research indicates that candidates who rely on AI during the application process are actually less likely to be hired, even as employers struggle to cope with a flood of applications.“The ability (for companies) to select the best worker today may be worse due to AI,” Anais Galdin, a researcher at Dartmouth told CNN Business.Galdin and Jesse Silbert of Princeton University examined tens of thousands of cover letters submitted on Freelancer.com, a job listing platform and found that after the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, cover letters became longer and more polished. However, employers placed less importance on them, making it harder to distinguish strong candidates from the wider pool.As a result, hiring rates dropped, and so did average starting wages, CNN reported.“If we do nothing to make information flow better between workers and firms, then we might have an outcome that looks something like this,” Silbert said, referring to the study’s findings.As application volumes rise, companies are increasingly automating interviews as well.According to a survey by recruitment software firm Greenhouse conducted in October, 54% of US job seekers said they had taken part in an AI-led interview. While virtual interviews became common during the pandemic in 2020, many employers now use AI systems to conduct interviews, without necessarily removing subjectivity from hiring decisions.“Algorithms can copy and even magnify human biases,” said Djurre Holtrop, a researcher who studies the use of asynchronous video interviews, algorithms and large language models in hiring.“Every developer needs to be wary of that,” CNN cited the expert.Daniel Chait, chief executive of Greenhouse, said the growing use of AI by both applicants and employers has created a negative cycle. “Both sides are saying, ‘This is impossible, it’s not working, it’s getting worse,’” Chait told CNN.Despite these concerns, adoption of the technology continues with one estimate projecting that the market for recruitment technology will grow to $3.1 billion by the end of this year. At the same time, resistance is mounting from lawmakers, labour groups and workers worried about discrimination.Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO labour union, described AI-driven hiring as “unacceptable”.“AI systems rob workers of opportunities they’re qualified for based on criteria as arbitrary as names, zip codes, or even how often they smile,” Shuler said in a statement to CNN.Several US states, including California, Colorado and Illinois, are introducing new laws and regulations aimed at setting standards for the use of AI in hiring. However, a recent executive order signed by US President Donald Trump raised questions about the future of state-level oversight. Samuel Mitchell, a Chicago-based employment lawyer, said the order does not “preempt” state law but adds to the “ongoing uncertainty” around regulation.He added that existing anti-discrimination laws still apply, even when companies use AI systems, and legal challenges are already emerging. In a case supported by the American Civil Liberties Union, a deaf woman is suing HireVue, an AI-powered recruitment company, alleging that an automated interview failed to meet legal accessibility standards. HireVue denied the claim, telling CNN that its technology reduces bias through a “foundation of validated behavioral science”.Even with these challenges, more and more AI is getting hiring access. New tools have made resume screening more sophisticated, potentially helping some candidates who may have been overlooked. But for those who value personal interaction, the shift has been unsettling.Jared Looper, an IT project manager in Salt Lake City, Utah, who previously worked as a recruiter, recently underwent an AI-led interview during his job search.

US 30-Year Mortgage Rates Fall to 6.18%: Are Buyers Still Cautious?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-mortgage-rate-us-30-year-home-loan-rates-edge-down-to-6-18-affordability-concerns-keep-buyers-cautious/articleshow/126164122.cms,"The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in the US edged slightly lower this week but continued to hover within a narrow range that has prevailed for nearly two months, offering only modest relief to homebuyers.The benchmark long-term mortgage rate slipped to 6.18% from 6.21% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said on Wednesday. A year ago, the average rate stood at 6.85%, according to data cited by the AP.Borrowing costs moved the other way for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, which are commonly used by homeowners refinancing their loans. The average rate rose to 5.50% from 5.47% a week earlier, compared with 6% a year ago, Freddie Mac said.Mortgage rates are influenced by a range of factors, including the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate decisions and investor expectations around inflation and economic growth. They typically track the 10-year US Treasury yield, which lenders use as a benchmark when pricing home loans.The 10-year Treasury yield stood at 4.15% by midday Wednesday, slightly higher than last week’s 4.12%.Freddie Mac data show that the 30-year mortgage rate has remained largely stable since October 30, when it dipped to 6.17%, its lowest level in more than a year.Rates began easing in July amid expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, which started in September and continued this month.While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, cuts to short-term rates can signal easing inflation or slower growth, prompting investors to buy US government bonds. That can push down long-term Treasury yields and, in turn, mortgage rates. However, rate cuts do not always lead to lower mortgage borrowing costs.Housing market conditions have improved slightly compared with a year ago. Home listings have risen sharply, and many sellers have lowered asking prices as properties take longer to sell, according to Realtor.com data. Buyers who can pay cash or manage current mortgage rates are in a stronger position than last year.Even so, affordability remains a major hurdle, particularly for first-time buyers without home equity. Economic uncertainty and concerns about the job market are also keeping many prospective buyers on the sidelines.Sales of previously owned US homes rose in November from the previous month, but slowed compared with a year earlier for the first time since May, despite mortgage rates hovering near their lowest levels of the year. Over the first 11 months of the year, home sales were down 0.5% from the same period last year.","The benchmark long-term mortgage rate slipped to 6.18% from 6.21% last week.

The figure came in well below the 232,000 claims forecast by economists surveyed by FactSet. The weekly report was released a day earlier than usual due to the Christmas holiday.Initial claims are widely seen as a near real-time indicator of layoffs, and the latest reading remains within a range considered historically healthy.The data comes against a mixed backdrop for the US labour market.

The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, its highest level since 2021.October’s decline in payrolls was driven largely by a sharp fall of 162,000 federal jobs, as workers exited following fiscal year-end and administrative cutbacks under the Trump administration.Subsequent revisions also shaved 33,000 jobs off August and September employment figures.Since March, job creation has averaged about 35,000 a month, roughly half the pace seen in the year ended March, as businesses grapple with uncertainty around President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and the lingering impact of elevated interest rates following the Federal Reserve’s aggressive tightening cycle in 2022 and 2023.Earlier this month, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points for the third consecutive meeting. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the move reflected concerns that the labour market may be weaker than headline figures suggest, adding that recent job data could be revised down by as much as 60,000.Several large companies, including UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon, have announced job cuts in recent months, though such reductions often take time to be reflected in official data.The Labor Department’s report also showed that the four-week moving average of jobless claims slipped by 750 to 216,750, smoothing out week-to-week volatility.

'India Got Out Of The Gates Faster Than Most Nations', Says US Expert As Trade Deal Talks Nears End

(Note: Chart below shows how it all began, Trump’s initial tariff impositions on various countries. However, trade deals with several nations are currently under way.)

US economy under pressure

Where this leaves the world

""The golden age of America begins right now,"" Donald Trump declared as he launched his second stint in the White House. Back in the presidency, he wasted no time signaling that this term would be markedly different from his first.Trump's biggest leverage this time: tariffs. Unlike before, trade would no longer be managed quietly through negotiations and frameworks—it would be enforced.In less than a year, MAGA supremo has turned tariffs into the central weapon of American foreign policy, unsettling allies, pressuring rivals and forcing governments across continents to recalculate their economic strategies. What began as an effort to ""put America first"" has since evolved into a global stress test -- of markets, diplomacy and America's own economy.Moments after taking office in January, Trump made it clear that America's trading partners would now operate on his terms. He revived a belief he has held for decades: that tariffs are not merely economic instruments, but levers of power -- tools to extract concessions, reshape behaviour and reassert US hegemony, with his doctrine of ""Make America Great Again"".That philosophy has defined the year 2025. Tariff rates have been announced, escalated, rolled back and reintroduced, often with little notice, keeping governments, markets and businesses on edge.In some cases, the pressure has produced partial deals. In others, it has hardened resistance. In almost all, it has altered the tone of global trade.Trump has justified the approach as part of a broader mission to revive American manufacturing, reduce trade deficits and protect domestic industry. But the scope of his actions has extended far beyond economics. Trade policy has become inseparable from his views on geopolitics, alliances and conflict, particularly the war in Ukraine and his simmering frustrations with Russia.That convergence is visible in how Trump has treated different countries. Large emerging economies such as China and India have faced some of the sharpest measures, often accompanied by rhetoric linking tariffs to security, energy purchases or geopolitical alignment. Neighbours Canada and Mexico have been pulled into tariff standoffs over migration, water disputes and regulatory issues. Venezuela has been targeted with sweeping secondary sanctions. Countries seen as cooperative, meanwhile, have often received exemptions, pauses or negotiated ceilings.However, he has been noticeably more restrained toward countries that have eagerly echoed Trump’s rhetoric, showered him with the praise he craves, and even gone so far as to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize.The numbers underline the scale of the shift. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the average US tariff rate has climbed to nearly 17%, up from under 3% at the end of 2024. The measures now generate roughly $30 billion a month for the US Treasury, a revenue stream the administration has openly touted.The global response has been swift. As CNBC reported, leaders from Europe to Asia have made repeated trips to Washington seeking carve-outs, exemptions or negotiated limits, often in return for promises of new investment on US soil. Framework agreements have been reached with partners including the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam. Yet the most consequential relationships, with China and India, remain unresolved.In April, it began with a jolt: Trump imposed a 104% tariff on Beijing, a decision announced by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.Trump's renewed tariff war opened with a heavy hand on China, rolling out a startling 145% duty on Chinese goods. Beijing hit back swiftly with a 125% tariff on US products, escalating the tug of war between the world’s two biggest economies. But the shock phase was short-lived. Within months, Washington softened its stance and scaled the tariff down to 30%, with further negotiations now under way.Yet China, the United States' biggest economic rival, absorbed the blow. Beijing's trade surplus defied Trump's tariff shock, climbing past a trillion dollars as China diversified away from the US, moved its manufacturing sector up the value chain, and relied on its strategic dominance in rare earth minerals, crucial to Western defence and technology, to push back against pressure from Washington and Europe.Chinese exports have remained resilient despite a 55% levy on shipments to the US, suggesting Beijing still has room to absorb more pain. For Trump, escalating the confrontation risks provoking Chinese curbs on rare earth supplies that are vital for American production of everything from smartphones to missiles.Tensions rose further on October 9, when Beijing expanded export controls to include 12 of 17 rare-earth metals and key refining equipment, effective December 1. China accused Washington of harming its interests and souring the atmosphere of trade talks. Earlier, Beijing criticised Trump’s tariff threats as ""double standards"" after he warned of an additional 100% duty in response to China’s curbs on rare earth exports.Despite frequent flare-ups, neither side can afford an escalated dispute, it would be a tightrope for both economies. Negotiations continue. Xi Jinping and Donald Trump met in October, with plans for more meetings ahead.Their discussions in South Korea covered trade, Taiwan, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the fentanyl crisis, according to both governments.The tug of war between Washington and Beijing is far from over. Efforts to stabilise ties loom large, especially as a tentative detente reached this year expires in late 2026. Trump and Xi are expected to meet twice next year as both sides try to prevent the world's two biggest economies from sliding into a deeper confrontation.Canada and Mexico, America’s closest neighbours, have endured a year of strained relations under Trump. His long-standing complaints over drug trafficking, migration, water disputes and trade imbalances resurfaced forcefully, this time backed by tariff threats.For Canada, the impact has been severe. In March, the US slapped a 25% tariff on Canadian goods, later raising it to 35%, with an additional 10% looming. Prime Minister Mark Carney, then new in office, found himself grappling with the steepest US trade restrictions in decades.On February 1, Trump signed executive orders imposing 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian goods, except Canadian oil and energy exports, which faced a lower 10% rate. The move threw North American supply chains into turmoil.The US has since issued a list of demands for restoring freer trade with Canada: opening its dairy market, removing penalties on American digital platforms under Canada’s Online Streaming Act, and lifting provincial bans on US liquor. The demands were spelled out by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer as part of an ongoing USMCA review.Canada has also been hit by additional Section 232 tariffs on steel, aluminium, autos, copper and wood, a revival of Trump’s first-term playbook.Mexico, meanwhile, faced a 30% tariff from August 1 after trade negotiations stalled. Trump later added another 5%, accusing Mexico of violating a cross-border water treaty.Mexico’s economy remains deeply integrated with the US, with more than $1 billion in daily bilateral commerce. Mexico’s recently imposed 50% tariff on India has been widely interpreted as a move influenced by pressure from Washington, and an attempt to stay aligned with the US ahead of the next USMCA review.Mexico and Canada already faced tariffs before this year’s reciprocal move, 25% and 35% on goods outside the USMCA, which is due for review in 2026.Trump’s relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often appeared warm. The US President has repeatedly spoken of his bond with PM Modi , calling him a ""great friend."" But his trade policy toward India tells a very different story.On August 1, the US imposed a 25% tariff on Indian goods, doubling it to 50% by August 27, along with an additional “penalty” linked to India’s ties with Russia. Trump accused India of maintaining some of the world’s highest tariffs and “obnoxious” non-monetary trade barriers, while also buying large volumes of Russian oil at a time when, as he put it, “everyone wants Russia to stop the killing in Ukraine.”His sharpest remark came in July: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”India pushed back firmly. Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal rejected Trump’s description of India as a “dead economy”, asserting that despite the hurdles imposed by the US administration, the country remained on track to become the world’s third-largest economy.“We have risen from the 11th largest economy to one of the top five economies driven by our reforms, the hard work of our farmers, MSMEs and entrepreneurs. It is widely expected that we will become the third-largest economy in a few years,” he said.India’s exports to the US did fall sharply after the tariff hikes, dropping 28.5% between May and October 2025. Yet, in a notable turnaround, overall exports surged 19.4% in November to $38.1 billion, with shipments rising not only to China but also to the US.Trump has repeatedly cast Brics as a threat to the dollar, claiming the bloc was “set up to hurt us.” He has warned that any country aligning with Brics would face tariffs from the US.""I told anybody who wants to be in Brics, that's fine, but we’re going to put tariffs on your nation,"" Trump said. He has repeatedly argued that Brics was designed to promote ""de-dollarisation"", weaken the Bretton Woods system and dilute American influence.Yet the reality has moved in the opposite direction. Brics has expanded from five members to ten -- Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the UAE and Indonesia -- with ten more designated as partner states. Several others, including Pakistan and Sri Lanka, have applied to join.The expansion has clearly unsettled Washington. Trump has insisted countries are “dropping out” of Brics, but the bloc has continued to grow, underscoring the limits of tariff threats as a deterrent.Trump’s tensions with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva -- and his open support for former leader Jair Bolsonaro -- shaped Washington’s trade posture toward Brazil this year.The US imposed a 40% tariff on Brazilian goods, later raising total duties to 50%, citing threats to US national security. The move was widely seen as political as much as economic, particularly amid Trump’s criticism of Brazil’s judiciary and its handling of Bolsonaro-related cases.By November, however, the White House began to retreat. Facing rising domestic food prices, Trump rolled back tariffs on Brazilian beef, cocoa, coffee and fruit, mirroring similar reversals elsewhere as inflation concerns mounted at home.After failing to influence Brazil’s judicial process, Trump was compelled to engage directly with Lula’s government, softening some of the earlier punitive measures.Trump’s crackdown on Venezuela has been among the harshest of his second term. He declared that any country purchasing Venezuelan oil or gas would face a 25% tariff on all trade with the US, a sweeping “secondary tariff” aimed largely at China, Venezuela’s biggest customer.Last week, Trump ordered a “complete blockade” of tankers moving in and out of Venezuelan waters, choking off what remains of the country’s oil lifeline.Trump has accused President Nicolás Maduro of sending migrants, criminals and drug traffickers into the US, claims he has offered no evidence for. US warships now patrol the region, and clashes at sea have resulted in fatalities.Venezuela, home to the world’s largest proven oil reserves, now accounts for less than 1% of global output — a collapse deepened by years of sanctions and reinforced by Trump’s latest measures.For now, the golden age remains elusive.Trump campaigned on reviving industry, lowering prices and creating jobs “like never before.” But the economic record under his tariff-heavy approach has been mixed.Manufacturing employment has barely grown since January, with factory jobs increasing in only two out of ten months this year. At the same time, the abrupt tariff hikes triggered price pressures across several sectors, from automobiles to consumer goods.The White House itself has acknowledged the strain. “More painful than I expected,” chief of staff Susie Wiles conceded, reflecting internal concerns over the pace and scale of the rollout.Economists remain divided on whether Trump’s tariffs will cause a temporary spike in inflation or lead to more persistent price rises. The Federal Reserve has been weighing the impact for months, factoring trade uncertainty into its policy outlook.Sensing political risk, the administration has begun easing some of the pressure. Tariffs on select agricultural imports, including beef, tomatoes, coffee and bananas, have been lowered, while a $12 billion aid package for farmers has been announced. Discussions on stimulus checks funded by tariff revenues have also surfaced.In less than a year, Trump has reshaped the global trading system, unsettling allies, pressuring adversaries and attempting to rewire America’s place in the world through tariffs rather than treaties.But as India and China push back, Brics expands and the US economy absorbs tariff-induced strain, the limits of this strategy are becoming clearer.Trump's strong alignment to his MAGA doctrine will restore American strength and manufacturing might. It risks isolating the US and accelerating the very multipolar shift he set out to prevent.For now, the outcome remains uncertain. What is clear is that global trade has entered a more volatile phase, one shaped as much by political calculation as by economic logic.The larger question, still unanswered, is whether Trump’s tariff wars are restoring American primacy, or hastening the rise of a world no longer willing to bend to Washington’s terms.","Trump's biggest leverage this time: tariffs.

"US district court backs Trump on $100K H-1B entry-fee, citing broad immigration powers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-district-court-backs-trump-on-100k-h-1b-entry-fee-citing-broad-immigration-powers/articleshow/126154448.cms,"U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH

A US district court judge has upheld President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a $100,000 entry-fee on new H-1B visa workers hired from outside the US, delivering a significant legal win to the administration’s assertion of broad executive authority over immigration.In an order issued on Tuesday night, Judge Beryl A. Howell, of the Columbia district court, rejected a legal challenge brought by the US Chamber of Commerce, holding that the proclamation fell squarely within powers granted to the President under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The court denied the business lobby’s request to block the fee and granted a summary judgment in favour of the Trump administration.Trump had announced the steep levy through a September 19 proclamation, triggering sharp concern among businesses that rely on foreign talent for specialised roles.The Chamber had argued that the new fee is unlawful because it overrides provisions of the INA that govern the H-1B program, including the requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas. It had also pointed out that the administrative procedures such as a public notice and inviting public comments had been bypassed.Rejecting those claims, Judge Howell said the Trump administration had met the conditions necessary to invoke statutory authority allowing the President to restrict entry of foreign nationals deemed detrimental to US interests. “The lawfulness of the Proclamation and its implementation rests on a straightforward reading of congressional statutes giving the President broad authority to regulate entry into the United States for immigrants and nonimmigrants alike,” her order stated.The Judge added that disputes over the policy’s wisdom lay outside the court’s remit. “So long as the actions dictated by the policy decision and articulated in the Proclamation fit within the confines of the law, the Proclamation must be upheld,” Judge Howell said.Following the proclamation, in Oct federal immigration agencies had issued a clarification diluting the impact to an extent. The clarification provided that fee would apply only to new H-1B petitions filed for workers hired from abroad, and not to existing H-1B employees or foreign students already in the US who transition to H-1B status from within the US.In response to the verdict, Daryl Joseffer, Executive Vice President and Chief Counsel of the US Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement, “The $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive for businesses, especially small- and medium-sized businesses that can least afford it. We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations. ”The lawsuit was one of the three filed against the entry-fee. Global Nurse Force with a coalition of US healthcare providers, educational institutions and others was the first to challenge the entry-fee by filing a law suit in the US District Court (Northern District of California). More recently, California and Massachusetts Attorneys General Rob Bonta and Andrea Joy Campbell, respectively, led a group of 20 Democratic‑led states in filing a law suit challenging this fee. Immigration attorneys state that all is not lost, especially since these other cases have different grounds of arguments.","A US district court judge has upheld President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a $100,000 entry-fee on new H-1B visa workers hired from outside the US.

Pakistan saw a 14% rise in foreign loans and grants during the first five months of the current fiscal year (July–November 2025), reaching $3.032 billion compared to $2.667 billion in the same period last year.Of the total inflows, foreign loans rose 46.2% to $2.521 billion, while grants fell by 43% to $54 million. In November alone, inflows amounted to $511 million, slightly higher than October’s $471 million but 46% lower than November 2024.Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1.2 billion disbursement. The current inflow figures do not yet include this latest IMF release, as reported by Dawn.The government has set a target of $19.9 billion in total foreign inflows for the current fiscal year, slightly higher than last year’s $19.4 billion.The Ministry of Economic Affairs reported that of the $3.032 billion inflows, $1.157 billion was for project financing, while $1.875 billion comprised non-project inflows. Loans for budget support stood at $966 million, against an annual target of $13.5 billion.Additionally, Pakistan mobilised $500 million under the Saudi Oil facility at a planned rate of $100 million per month.Inflows from bilateral and multilateral lenders totalled $2.066 billion in the first five months, compared to $1.73 billion in the same period last year, according to Dawn.Pakistan received $1.258 billion from multilateral lenders and $808 million from other bilateral lenders. Remittances from overseas Pakistanis also rose to $966 million, exceeding the annual target of $609 million.The IMF’s support comes amid Pakistan’s heavy reliance on external financing. The country narrowly avoided default in 2023 and is now among the Fund’s largest borrowers after Argentina and Ukraine.Earlier this month, the IMF approved a $1.2 billion disbursement under Pakistan’s ongoing Extended Fund Facility and Resilience and Sustainability Facility programmes.This latest move lifts Pakistan’s total inflows from the IMF to roughly $3.3 billion and will be reflected in official accounts in the coming weeks.IMF officials have highlighted that Pakistan’s policy implementation has remained broadly consistent with programme goals, even after the recent monsoon floods that killed more than 1,000 people.The Fund observed that fiscal discipline, including maintaining a primary surplus of 1.3% of GDP in FY25, helped preserve macroeconomic stability. Gross reserves reached $14.5 billion at the end of FY25, up from $9.4 billion a year earlier and are expected to expand further in FY26.The Fund also stressed that Pakistan’s ongoing reform measures, including tax policy adjustments, energy sector restructuring and governance improvements, are critical to maintaining financial stability and supporting medium-term growth.As part of ongoing support, the IMF has imposed 11 new conditions on Pakistan, bringing the total to 64 over 18 months. These measures address governance flaws, corruption, tax reforms, the power sector and structural inefficiencies.

Asian stock markets edged higher on Wednesday, rounding off a strong year driven largely by gains in AI-related stocks, while commodities such as gold and silver extended their rally to fresh record highs as 2025 comes to an end.Overnight in the United States, Wall Street ended on a positive note, with the S&P 500 closing at a record high as the long-awaited Santa Claus rally finally emerged. Investor sentiment was supported by data showing that the US economy expanded at a much faster pace than expected in the third quarter, as reported by Reuters.Gold and silver were among the biggest movers in early Asian trading. Spot gold rose 0.8% to a new all-time high of $4,524 per ounce, taking its gains for the year to around 72%. Silver jumped 1.2% to a record $72.27 per ounce and was on track for an annual rise of nearly 150%, marking its strongest yearly performance on record.Equity markets across Asia were modestly higher. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3%, taking its gain for the year to about 26%, the index’s best annual performance since 2017. Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.4% and was also up around 26% for the year, while South Korean stocks outperformed the region with a sharp surge of 72% in 2025.Global equity futures were largely flat amid thin year-end trading volumes, with EURO STOXX 50, Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures showing little movement.Market participants remained broadly positive about equities, despite persistent risks.“As equity markets enter the fourth year of a bull market, our underlying market call remains constructive,” said Scott Chronert, a US equity strategist at Citi.He added that while earnings growth and high valuations could support further gains, sharp differences in performance across sectors and market segments are likely.In currency markets, the Japanese yen strengthened for a third straight session amid concerns over possible intervention by Japanese authorities. The dollar slipped 0.3% to 155.78 yen, moving away from the 158 level that has previously triggered intervention. The euro was steady at $1.18 and has risen about 14% this year, while the dollar has fallen roughly 10% against major peers in 2025.In the bond market, US Treasuries have gained this year following the resumption of Federal Reserve rate cuts. The two-year Treasury yield was steady at 3.532%, down 72 basis points for the year, while the 10-year yield stood at 4.1589%, lower by about 42 basis points in 2025.Oil prices were little changed in early Asian trade but were set to end the year lower for a third consecutive year. Brent crude futures were flat at $62.41 a barrel and were down about 16% for the year.","Asian stock markets edged higher on Wednesday, rounding off a strong year driven largely by gains in AI-related stocks.

What is the $100,000 H-1B fee?

Which companies could be most affected?



A US federal judge upheld the Trump administration's move to move ahead with President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas, dealing a setback to the American technology companies and business groups challenging the move.US District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington DC on Tuesday rejected a lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Commerce, which argued that the steep fee violated federal immigration law and would force companies, hospitals and other employers to cut jobs and services.Howell ruled that Trump had the legal authority to impose the fee, noting that his proclamation was issued under ""an express statutory grant of authority to the President.""""The parties’ vigorous ‌debate over the ultimate wisdom of this political judgment is not within the province of the courts,"" Howell wrote, Reuters reported.""So long as the actions dictated by the policy decision and articulated in the Proclamation fit within the confines of the law, the Proclamation must be upheld,"" she added.The Chamber of Commerce had argued that the president lacked the power to impose such a fee and warned it would hurt employers that rely on skilled foreign workers.Its executive vice president and chief counsel Daryl Joseffer said many small and medium-sized businesses would struggle to afford the cost. ""We are disappointed in ‍the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure ‌that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended,"" Joseffer said in a statement.The H-1B visa programme allows US employers to hire foreign workers in specialised fields and is widely used by technology companies. The programme issues 65,000 visas annually, with an additional 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees, typically valid for three to six years.Until now, H-1B visa fees generally ranged between $2,000 and $5,000, depending on various factors. Under Trump's order, however, the fee for new H-1B applications would jump sharply to $100,000.H-1B visas are allocated through a lottery system, though the programme mainly serves the tech sector. The US Department of Homeland Security has also moved to overhaul the selection process, replacing the random lottery with a system that favours higher-paid and more highly skilled foreign workers.The Trump administration says this change is aimed at protecting American wages and jobs.Companies such as Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are among the largest users of H-1B visas, according to US government data cited by Bloomberg.Opponents of the policy argue that the higher fee would force employers to choose between significantly higher labour costs or hiring fewer highly skilled foreign workers. Separate legal challenges have also been filed by Democratic-led states and a coalition of employers, nonprofits and religious organisations.In issuing the order, Trump cited his authority under federal immigration law to restrict the entry of foreign nationals deemed detrimental to US interests.Judge Howell further stated that the administration had adequately supported its claim that the H-1B programme was displacing American workers, pointing to examples where companies laid off thousands of US employees while continuing to seek H-1B visas.","US District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington DC on Tuesday rejected a lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Commerce.

'American Lives At Risk, Economy Under Threat': Kristi Noem's Shocking House Homeland Testimony

The US economy expanded in the third quarter at the fastest pace in two years, bolstered by resilient consumer and business spending and calmer trade policies.Inflation-adjusted GDP, which measures the value of goods and services produced in the US, increased at a 4.3% annualised pace, a Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed on Tuesday. That was higher than all but one forecast in a Bloomberg survey and followed 3.8% growth in the prior period.The BEA was originally due to publish an advance estimate of GDP on Oct. 30, but the report was cancelled due to govt shutdown. The S& rose in early trading Tuesday, while Treasuries fell. The delayed report card shows the economy maintained momentum through the middle of the year as consumers powered ahead and the most punitive of Trump's tariffs were rolled back. While the shutdown is expected to weigh on fourth-quarter growth, economists expect a modest rebound in 2026.","Inflation-adjusted GDP increased at a 4.3% annualised pace.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

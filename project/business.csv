ICICIBC continues to leverage its strong retail and corporate franchise, disciplined risk management, and superior operating metrics. With leadership continuity under Mr. Sandeep Bakhshi, the bank is well positioned to sustain healthy loan growth momentum and deliver best-in-class profitability across cycles. 3QFY26 PAT declined 4% YoY to INR113.2b, missing estimates due to one-off INR12.8b agri-related provisions.Core performance was steady, with NII, PPoP, margins, and asset quality in line, while credit trends in unsecured portfolios showed improvement. Despite one-off provisions, ICICIBC is on track to deliver ~2.2% RoA in FY26E, improving to ~2.3% over FY27–28E. We fine-tune estimates and model FY27E RoA/RoE of 2.3%/16.1%, reiterating ICICIBC as a top BUY.Tata Steel is well placed to benefit from improving steel realizations, operating efficiencies, and robust domestic demand. While global tariff-related uncertainties may weigh in the near term, sustained strength in India and improving Europe performance support long-term earnings visibility. The acquisition of a 50.01% stake in Thriveni Pellets provides Tata Steel access to 4mtpa pellet capacity and a 212km slurry pipeline.This strengthens backward integration, supports upcoming expansions, and mitigates risks from expiring iron-ore leases by FY30.Tata Steel is entering a multi-year expansion across long, flat, and downstream products. Capex will rise in a phased manner, maintaining balance sheet comfort.

SVB investigations – Need for time bound closures

Provisional assessments – Need for structural changes

Digitalization as the Cornerstone of Compliance Reform

Conclusion - Shifting the Narrative from Rates to Reliability

(Krishan Arora is Partner & Leader, Indirect Tax, India Investment Advisory - Grant Thornton Bharat. With inputs from Ravi Jain, Director, India Investment Advisory - Grant Thornton Bharat)

India customs has seen several reforms over the years – from tariff rationalization to digitization to simplified procedures & schemes to support domestic Industry. While high tariff rates and duty rate rationalization remains a key industry demand, there is a need for a structured next phase focusing towards simplifying regulatory provisions, procedural laws, and leveraging technology for ease of doing business. In this context, the upcoming budget is expected to place significant emphasis on reforms aimed at ease of compliance, accelerating system modernization and procedural simplification.The next phase of customs reform is likely to be driven by faster processes and time-bound resolutions, as delays, uncertainties and administrative cost often outweigh duty impact.SVB investigations and provisional assessments have been a persistent issue which results in prolonged uncertainty for businesses. Despite introducing time bound resolutions, a structured framework is required to make this effective.This is discussed below.Special Valuation Branch (SVB) investigations mechanism currently does not have a prescribed time limit for completion, resulting in prolonged uncertainty for businesses. In numerous cases, investigation has been pending for several years, going beyond a decade in some cases. This adds to compliance burden and hardship for businesses – in terms of continued monitoring of process, submission of data time & again and uncertainty of potential incremental duty burden which can no longer be passed on to customers. Additionally, it also adds to the cost of compliance.It is expected that the government will introduce appropriate provisions in the budget for time bound closure for SVB investigations. The expected move will provide certainty and reduce risk of custom duty becoming a non-transferable cost to businesses.Recently there have also been discussions around revamping the SVB process and introducing a post clearance audit to validate related party customs valuations. It is expected that issues with the current system do not linger on in the new set of procedures, as and when introduced.Budget 2025 took a positive step to introduce a two-year period for finalization of provisional assessments. While this provision is in the right spirit, a framework for tangible action points on behalf of both importers as well as customs officers may be brought in to make this two-year period work in practice.The statute should also provide for a time bound agreement in form of a provisional assessment order culling out responsibilities of importer and customs officer to facilitate finalization of provisional assessment.For instance, in case of classification disputes leading to provisional assessment, importers may be directed to obtain an advance ruling within a specific period for assessment closure. Similarly, in case of valuation issues, customs officers should be entrusted with time bound closures.The period of limitation for issuing notices for assessments is counted from the date of finalized assessment instead of date of filing of bill of entry. As provisional assessments are often pending for years, the actual period covered in potential litigation goes well beyond the statutory limitation of five years. This causes multifold issues for industry including risk of several years going into litigation, requirement of maintenance of records for such number of years as covered in provisional assessments and recurring provision in books of accounts for potential duty liability.To ensure certainty and ease of doing business, the period of limitation should be counted from the date of filing of the bill of entry. This will provide confidence to industry, reduce retrospective duty & interest demands and free up administrative time locked in dispute resolution.While digital systems are used there is still a need to deeply integrate the systems and eliminate manual intervention to reduce operational delays which affect efficiency of businesses.Digital transformation remains central to the customs reform agenda. While the Government has been successful in digitalizing the systems, different platforms with limited interaction have caused significant procedural issues and duplication of efforts for businesses.The Budget is expected to reinforce one unified customs system to further smoothen the process of paperless data submission, further easing clearance process and reduced dwell time.India’s customs reform journey is entering a phase where regulatory stability, procedural simplicity, digital reliability, will be more important than marginal tariff adjustments. A customs framework that is more predictable, transparent, and technology‑enabled will support in improving India’s trade facilitation standards and in supporting the broader objectives of economic growth and global integration.","India customs has seen several reforms over the years – from tariff rationalization to digitization to simplified procedures & schemes to support domestic Industry.

Union Budget 2026: Wishlist for Indian bond investors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2026-wishlist-for-indian-bond-investors/articleshow/127591734.cms,"Currently, interest earned from bonds is taxed at the investor’s applicable slab rate, unlike equities where a clear distinction exists.

1. Rationalise

TDS on Bond Interest Income

(Coupon)

2. Introduce a Fair and Predictable Tax Regime for Bond Interest

3. Create a Uniform Distribution Framework for Bonds

4. Flattening of the Government Bond yield curve

(Vishal Goenka is Co‑Founder, IndiaBonds)

As India aspires to build a resilient, diversified, and globally competitive financial system, the role of a deep and vibrant bond market cannot be overstated. This is also evident in NITI Aayog’s recent report on ‘Deepening the Corporate Bond Market’ which sets the policy roadmap for next 5 years. Fixed income is not just a portfolio stabiliser for households; it is also the backbone of long‑term capital formation for India’s growth ambitions.Over the past few years, SEBI’s regulatory reforms such as the introduction of Online Bond Platform Providers (OBPPs), electronic bidding platforms, ₹10,000 min. face value for bonds, and improved disclosure standards have laid a strong foundation. However, to truly democratise bond investing and meaningfully increase retail participation, the Union Budget 2026 presents an important opportunity to address a few structural bottlenecks for Indian investors.The introduction of Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on bond interest income in Union Budget 2023 has unintentionally added friction for retail investors. While the intent was to improve tax compliance, the outcome has been increased complexity in return calculations (XIRR) and cash‑flow mismatches for investors. There was no TDS on interest from listed corporate bonds from 2008 to 2023.Unlike fixed deposits, bond investments often involve secondary market trades, accrued interest adjustments, and varying holding periods.The application of TDS in such cases makes it harder for investors to assess their actual post‑tax returns and increases the operational burden of reconciliation while filing their ITR or writing to companies directly for deductions due via 15G/15H forms.Removing TDS on bond interest income would simplify the investment process, improve transparency in yield computation, and encourage investors without compromising tax collection, as interest income would continue to be fully taxable at the time of filing returns.Currently, interest earned from bonds is taxed at the investor’s applicable slab rate, unlike equities where a clear distinction exists between short‑term and long‑term capital gains with concessional tax rates. In fact, tax on interest from bond investments at slab rate may be even higher than those paid on debt mutual funds at flat 20% This creates an uneven playing field and could discourage long‑term participation in corporate bonds.For many retail investors earning annual returns in the range of 7–12%, slab‑rate taxation significantly erodes post‑tax outcomes, making bonds appear less attractive despite their lower volatility and capital preservation characteristics.A simplified and predictable tax framework—such as a flat tax rate of around 20% on bond interest income would bring parity across asset classes. This would encourage households to allocate more savings to bonds, support long‑term investing behaviour, and help channel domestic capital into India’s growing economy.While mutual funds, equities and insurance products operate under well‑defined, standardised distribution frameworks, bond distribution in India remains fragmented across multiple participant types and channels. This lack of uniformity limits scalability, restricts investor trust, and creates uncertainty for intermediaries.A clear, regulator‑approved distribution framework for corporate bonds—similar to the Authorised Person (AP) structure in equities and AMFI Registration Numbers (ARNs) in mutual funds—can help enforce fit‑and‑proper criteria, define roles and accountability, and standardise disclosure and suitability practices across the industry.For effective transmission of rate cuts by RBI into the economy, flattening of the government bond yield curve is essential. Post RBI rate cuts last year of 125 bps, the 10y bond has barely moved 20bps lower and in fact yields on 15y bonds have moved higher. A lot of this is due to technical supply and deteriorating sentiment due to a weakening rupee. Achievement around fiscal deficit numbers and the government’s future borrowing program would bring the confidence in markets on the longer end of the bond curve and bring yields down. Financial prudence will be closely watched at the budget to encourage the bond market.Union Budget 2026 has the opportunity to send a strong signal: that bonds are not just institutional instruments, but a core part of India’s household investment landscape. Enabling this shift will be critical as India moves towards its next phase of economic growth – Viksit Bharat 2047.","Currently, interest earned from bonds is taxed at the investor’s applicable slab rate, unlike equities where a clear distinction exists.

Financial services as a growth engine: What Budget 2026 must deliver,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/financial-services-as-a-growth-engine-what-budget-2026-must-deliver/articleshow/127641361.cms,"A modern, fast‑growing economy depends on strong financial intermediaries.

By Jugal Kajaria

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

(Jugal Kajaria is Tax Partner – EY India. With Inputs from Darshil Shah, Tax Professional, EY India)

India stands at a pivotal moment as Budget 2026 approaches, and few sectors can accelerate growth as powerfully as Financial Services (FS). India’s real GDP growth is estimated at 7.4% in FY26 led by investment demand and services sector growth. More than a system of payments or lending, the FS sector today acts as the economy’s central engine by allocating capital, pricing risk, and transmitting policy signals across the real economy. When this engine operates efficiently, it amplifies growth across infrastructure, manufacturing, MSMEs, households, and the expanding footprints of the digital ecosystem.A modern, fast‑growing economy depends on strong financial intermediaries. In India, banks, NBFCs, insurers, pension funds, mutual funds, and capital markets channel household and institutional savings into productive investments across the economy. This steady flow of capital drives GDP growth, improves productivity, formalises activity, and supports MSMEs and start‑ups through credit, funding, and risk‑mitigation tools. To sustain this momentum, Budget 2026 must focus on strengthening credit systems, deepening markets, and ensuring a predictable and innovation‑friendly regulatory environment.Continuity of the pace of tax reforms with the mantra of ‘simplification’ being the core objective will play a vital role in shaping India’s competitiveness as a global financial hub. A rationalisation of the tax regime for foreign bank branches—which currently face an effective tax rate of 38.22 percent -- would create a more balanced environment for global institutions. Extending withholding tax exemption on interest received to NBFCs similar to the exemption provided to Banks would introduce operational efficiency and arrest cash flow leakages for NBFCs helping them focus on greater penetration.Judicial clarity and global alignment are equally important. Recent Supreme Court rulings in the Tiger Global and American Express have implications for foreign investors and foreign banks. The global investor community is looking at clear and upfront tax guidance which would provide the predictability needed for investment decisions. The global investor community would be keenly looking at how the Hon’ble Finance Minister balances the expectations of the global investor community in respect of their past as well as the future investments.Alongside these reforms, India has been gaining prominence as an emerging international financial services centre (IFSC) through the development of GIFT City. Past Budgets have provided regulatory and tax relaxations that have enabled strong and steady progress. Global and Indian investors are regularly coming up with newer business models in GIFT City, which needs regulatory and tax amendments for enabling the same. Continuing with the past practice, Budget 2026 should continue to promote GIFT City for development of new business activities and products in GIFT City. The emerging areas of Global / Regional Treasury Centres, Commodity Trading, and Oilfield Equipment leasing will be eagerly looking up to Budget 2026 for regulatory support and tax clarity.Notifying the framework for Variable Capital Company structures would significantly widen the range of fund‑management activities within the IFSC. As the re‑insurance market in GIFT City continues to expand, it will be important to ensure a level playing field for Lloyd’s syndicates to attract larger pools of global capacity. Collectively, these reforms can materially enhance GIFT City’s attractiveness for banks, asset managers, treasury centres, insurers, leasing platforms, and other cross‑border financial participants.Similar to recent Budgets, timely disposal of tax assessments and appeals must remain a priority. With about INR 26.3 lakh crore—around 8 percent of India’s GDP—locked in income‑tax disputes, direct‑tax litigation continues to be a major concern. This issue is particularly significant for the FS sector, where cases often involve legacy matters that require clear and consistent guidance from tax authorities and take years to be resolved. Establishing defined timelines and accountability frameworks would enhance trust and reduce uncertainty for financial institutions and investors.To conclude, India’s FS sector is positioned to power the nation’s next phase of growth. Budget 2026 can accelerate this transition by pairing targeted policy support with competitive tax rules. Strengthening FS institutions, deepening markets, and improving digital and regulatory architecture will expand the economy’s credit capacity, strengthen inclusion, and reinforce India’s emergence as a global financial hub—creating the investment foundation needed for sustainable and long‑term growth. These financial sector reforms will go a long way in not only sustaining GDP growth but also in boosting the per capita income of India’s population.","India’s real GDP growth is estimated at 7.4% in FY26 led by investment demand and services sector growth.

"For haven’s sake: Gold, silver continue to rally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/for-havens-sake-gold-silver-continue-to-rally/articleshow/127663838.cms,".

Mumbai: Prices of gold and silver jumped to record highs in the domestic market on Tuesday following international price trends over the extended weekend in India as investors globally continued to shift to haven assets as geopolitical tensions remained at elevated levels. For silver in particular, rising demand from several of the fast-growing industries like EV, semiconductors, solar and smart grids, at a time when supply is stagnant, is fuelling the rally globally, market players said.During the day, in the spot bullion market in India gold traded above the Rs 1.6 lakh/10gm level while silver traded at above Rs 3.6 lakh/kg mark, both all-time high levels. In late trades, however, the prices softened a bit as internationally prices of these two precious metals saw some correction. After rallying to above $5,100/ounce (Oz) and $114/Oz, gold and silver prices, respectively, were hovering below the $5,100 and $108 levels.In late trades on the MCX, gold futures for Feb delivery were trading at Rs 1.58 lakh/10 gm level, down from Rs 1.59 lakh earlier, while silver futures for March delivery were trading at Rs 3.6 lakh/kg level, down marginally from Rs 3.65 lakh earlier in the session.While the rally in yellow metal is based on safe haven demands and slipping confidence in dollar as a fiat currency, multiple factors are powering the rally seen in white metal.“Silver now derives nearly two-thirds of its demand from industrial uses—solar, electronics, EVs, AI hardware and smart grids—placing it at the centre of the global energy and digital shift,” Kotak Mutual Fund noted in a blog post titled ‘Silver is the new rare earth: The shiny metal changing our world’.“With silver largely mined as a by-product and ore grades falling, supply cannot keep pace with demand, resulting in a (about) 230 million oz deficit in 2025 and persistent market tightness,” the fund house said. “India became the largest importer of refined silver in 2025, (at) $9.2 billion, up about 44% on the year, driven by substitution from gold, festive demand, and the expansion of solar and electronics manufacturing. ”","During the day, in the spot bullion market in India gold traded above the Rs 1.6 lakh/10gm level.

Official advisories:

Banking operations at public sector banks across India are facing widespread disruption on Tuesday, as the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) went ahead with a nationwide strike. The strike comes as unions demand the immediate implementation of a five-day work week, a long-standing request that has yet to be formalised by the government.The move is expected to affect branch-level services for five consecutive days, with banks already closed on January 23 (Basant Panchami), January 24 (FourthSaturday), January 25 (Sunday), and January 26 (Republic Day).The UFBU, an umbrella body of nine unions representing bank officers and employees, had held conciliation meetings with the chief labour commissioner on January 22 and 23. However, union leaders said these talks failed to provide any assurance regarding their demands.“Despite detailed discussions during the conciliation proceedings, there was no assurance on our demand. Hence, we have been compelled to proceed with the strike action,” said C H Venkatachalam, general secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), a UFBU constituent, to PTI.Union leaders emphasise that the strike is not aimed at inconveniencing customers, but at promoting a humane and sustainable banking system.The strike has been called by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), which includes nine major unions representing officers and employees of public sector banks.Unions are demanding the implementation of a five-day work week, which would make all Saturdays holidays in public sector banks.reportedly the proposal for Saturday holidays was agreed during the 12th Bipartite Settlement with the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) in March 2024, but the government notification is still pending.Branch-level operations like cash deposits, withdrawals, cheque clearances and administrative work will be affected at public sector banks, including SBI, PNB, and Bank of Baroda.Major private sector banks such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank are expected to remain largely unaffected, as their employees are not part of the unions participating in the strike.Digital services, including UPI, internet banking, and mobile banking, will continue to function. However, ATM cash availability may face localised delays due to logistical issues.Leaders say the strike is aimed at improving workforce efficiency and financial stability, not disrupting services for customers.“This movement is not against customers, but for a sustainable, humane, and efficient banking system. A rested banker serves the nation better,” said L Chandrasekhar, general secretary of NCBE.An urgent meeting chaired by the secretary, department of financial services, with SBI officials, MDs of nationalised banks, and the IBA CEO, was held to ensure smooth operations, including government transactions and business correspondent services.Banks have confirmed that ATMs are loaded with sufficient cash, and timely replenishment arrangements have been made. While branch work may be affected, digital channels are expected to function normally.Several public sector banks, including SBI, have informed stock exchanges about the strike. SBI in a statement said, “While the bank has made necessary arrangements to ensure normal functioning in its branches and offices on the day of strike, it is likely that work may be impacted.”","The strike has been called by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), which includes nine major unions representing officers and employees of public sector banks.

Khosla raids Elon’s ghosla: Calls on tech workers to quit Musk's Tesla and SpaceX,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/khosla-raids-elons-ghosla-nest-calls-on-tech-workers-to-quit-musks-tesla-and-spacex/articleshow/127639073.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

Elon Musk On EU Radar; X’s AI Chatbot Grok Faces Biggest Probe Over Sexual Deepfakes | Details

Among Silicon Valley elites where tech titans have largely aligned with President Donald Trump’s purportedly race-driven MAGA vision, Indian-American venture capitalist Vinod Khosla has been an outlier. Exceptional as his opposition to Trump has been, the billionaire tech savant has set off a political and cultural firestorm this week with a blunt message aimed at MAGA maverick Elon Musk’s workforce: if you are a non-white employee at Tesla, SpaceX or X, you should quit — and come work for him instead.In a viral post on X, Khosla accused Musk of advancing a racially exclusionary version of Trump’s MAGA movement and urged employees who disagreed to walk away. “@elonmusk doesn’t want MAGA, he wants WAGA — ‘white America great again’ — as a ‘racism is great and desirable’ paradigm,” Khosla wrote, responding to Musk’s comments about white people becoming a “rapidly diminishing minority.” Khosla went on to invite “all non-whites… and all decent whites” at Musk’s companies to resign and send their LinkedIn profiles to Khosla Ventures.The extraordinary call — part political denunciation, part talent raid — crystallized Khosla’s position as one of the very few tech titans willing to openly challenge Trump’s growing alliance with Silicon Valley’s elite.While much of the industry – including companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM, all led by Indian-Americans – has moved to accommodate, or even embrace, Trump II, Khosla has chosen defiance, framing the moment as a moral test for American capitalism.Musk responded by calling Khosla a “pompous a******” and reminding him that his partner, Shivon, is half Indian and his eldest son with her “is named in honor of the great Indian physicist Chandrasekhar.”The Musk clash did not emerge in isolation. For months, Khosla has used his social media presence to attack Trump’s leadership, values and approach to governance. In January 2026, he described the administration’s agenda as “The Undoing Project,” accusing Trump of orchestrating a “rampant, multifarious attack on American values, norms, institutions, laws, and democracy.” He has warned that fear and cynicism are being used to silence opposition and has repeatedly urged Republicans, executives and investors to speak out.Khosla’s hostility toward Trump is deeply personal as well as political. An immigrant from India and a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, he has argued that Trump’s rhetoric and policies undermine the meritocratic ideals that powered Silicon Valley’s rise. In earlier posts that resurfaced during the 2024 election cycle, Khosla said he despised Trump for his “lack of values, his pathological lying, his selfishness,” accusing him of appealing to “the least appealing parts of American society. ”That worldview now puts Khosla sharply at odds with the prevailing direction of the tech industry. A growing cohort of influential “tech bros” has signed up, explicitly or implicitly, for MAGA. Musk stands at the center of that universe, having donated heavily to Trump’s campaign and emerged as the president’s most powerful ally in Silicon Valley. Others in Trump’s orbit include PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, investor and podcaster David Sacks, and venture capital heavyweights Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, all of whom have praised Trump’s promises of deregulation, tax cuts and a lighter regulatory touch on artificial intelligence and crypto.Even executives who once positioned themselves as Trump skeptics have largely shifted to pragmatic cooperation. Leaders of Meta (Mark Zuckerberg), Amazon (Jeff Bezos), Apple (Tim Cook), Google (Sundar Pichai), Microsoft (Satya Nadella), and IBM (Arvind Krishna) have attended Trump events, increased political donations and pledged billions in US investments, while tech lobbying has surged to record levels. The calculation is straightforward: access, influence and regulatory relief outweigh ideological discomfort.By contrast, open opposition has become rare. Aside from Khosla, only a handful of prominent figures — including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and entrepreneur Mark Cuban — have maintained public distance from Trump. While dozens of top venture capitalists now lean pro-Trump, outspoken critics can be counted on one hand.The divide carries consequences for tech workers, many of whom remain politically liberal even as their employers drift right. Over 450 employees from Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and OpenAI recently signed an open letter demanding their CEOs ""pick up the phone"" to stop ICE excesses. Khosla’s call for non-white employees to leave Musk’s companies is tapping into that tension, highlighting a widening gap between executive power and workforce values. As Trump settles deeper into his second term, Silicon Valley increasingly looks like a sector that has chosen alignment over resistance. Khosla, by contrast, is betting that dissent still matters — even if it leaves him standing nearly alone.",Indian-American venture capitalist Vinod Khosla has been an outlier among Silicon Valley elites who have largely aligned with President Donald Trump’s purportedly race-driven MAGA vision. He has accused Musk of advancing a racially exclusionary version of Trump's MAGA movement and urged employees who disagreed to walk away.

US stock markets opened on a mixed note on Tuesday as strong earnings from major companies lifted technology shares. However, a sharp sell-off in health insurance stocks pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower amid concerns over future Medicare payments.At 9:30 am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 305.69 points or 0.62 per cent, to 49,106.71. In contrast, the S&P 500 rose 13.94 points or 0.20 per cent, to 6,964.17. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite gained 112.68 points or 0.48 per cent, to 23,714.03.Markets reacted to a fresh batch of corporate earnings ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision later this week. Technology and auto stocks found support, while healthcare shares declined sharply after the Trump administration proposed a Medicare Advantage payment increase of less than 1 per cent for 2027.Health insurers came under heavy pressure, dragging the Dow lower. UnitedHealth Group and Humana lost nearly 16 per cent of their value before the opening bell, while Elevance Health fell 7.9 per cent and CVS Health dropped 13 per cent, according to AP.Investors were disappointed by the lower-than-expected rate increase, which threatens profit margins in Medicare Advantage plans that cover Americans aged 65 and above.UnitedHealth, the largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the US, reported fourth-quarter profit and revenue close to estimates but warned that its revenue could decline in 2026. The stock is down more than 40 per cent since April, reflecting mounting concerns over funding cuts and rising healthcare costs.In contrast, shares of General Motors jumped nearly 5 per cent after the automaker beat quarterly profit estimates and announced a share buyback programme. GM also said it expects to reduce losses from electric vehicle production in 2026 as it scales back output.American Airlines rose about 4 per cent after issuing strong guidance for 2026, despite missing fourth-quarter profit targets. The airline said it lost $325 million in revenue due to the recent government shutdown.Investors are also watching earnings from several mega-cap companies due later this week, including Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday, followed by Apple on Thursday.Attention remains on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it announces its policy decision on Wednesday. While the Fed has been cutting rates to support growth and employment, inflation remains above its 2 per cent target, limiting room for aggressive easing.Global markets were mixed. In Europe, Germany’s DAX was flat, France’s CAC 40 rose 0.4 per cent and Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.5 per cent. Asian markets ended mostly higher, led by South Korea’s Kospi, which surged 2.7 per cent, while Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.9 per cent.In commodities, gold prices were steady at around $5,084 an ounce after hitting a record above $5,100 on Monday, as investors sought safe-haven assets amid global trade tensions and inflation concerns.Silver fell nearly 4 per cent. Oil prices were largely unchanged, while the U.S. dollar weakened slightly against the yen and euro. Markets remained volatile as investors weighed earnings, central bank policy and rising geopolitical and trade risks.","At 9:30 am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 305.69 points or 0.62 per cent, to 49,106.71.

UAE firm Al Habtoor plans legal action against Lebanon over $1.7 billion investment losses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uae-firm-al-habtoor-plans-legal-action-against-lebanon-over-1-7-billion-investment-losses/articleshow/127566752.cms,"Photo credit- AP

A Dubai-based conglomerate has said it will initiate legal action against Lebanese authorities, alleging losses of more than $1.7 billion following years of economic crisis, banking restrictions and political instability in Lebanon.The Al Habtoor Group said on Monday that its investments in Lebanon have suffered “severe and sustained harm” due to measures imposed by Lebanese authorities and the country’s central bank, which prevented the group from freely accessing and transferring funds deposited in local banks.The group’s businesses in Lebanon were badly hit by the country’s historic economic collapse that began in late 2019, as well as by the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war. The World Bank has estimated the cost of reconstruction and recovery from the conflict at around $11 billion.Lebanon’s prolonged financial crisis, rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement, has left individuals and companies unable to access their own savings trapped in the banking system.Al Habtoor Group operates several assets in Lebanon, including the Metropolitan Palace Hotel in a Beirut suburb and Habtoor Land, a large theme park east of the capital.Last year, the group had reversed earlier plans to dismantle the Metropolitan Palace Hotel.In a statement, the conglomerate said the damage to its assets and properties in Lebanon exceeds $1.7 billion, blaming not only banking restrictions but also the wider political, economic, financial and social crises, as well as the failure of the Lebanese state to provide a stable and secure investment environment.While reiterating that it remains open to “lawful and constructive solutions” that would fully restore its rights, the group said it has exhausted all good-faith efforts to resolve the dispute amicably.“As a result, the group has no other alternative but to advance this matter further and proceed to take all legal measures necessary to protect and enforce its rights under applicable international agreements and legal frameworks,” it said, without specifying where the legal action would be filed.Officials at the Lebanese prime minister’s office were not immediately available for comment.The move comes at a time when Lebanon has been seeking to repair ties with oil-rich Gulf countries after years of strained relations linked to the influence of Hezbollah. The militant group was severely weakened during its latest war with Israel, which ended with a US-brokered ceasefire in November 2024.Lebanon has since installed a new president and prime minister, both of whom have pledged to fight corruption and stabilise the country’s battered economy.","Al Habtoor Group says its investments in Lebanon have suffered “severe and sustained harm’ The Dubai-based conglomerate alleges losses of more than $1.7 billion following years of economic crisis, banking restrictions and political instability in Lebanon.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127566722,imgsize-1333492,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

The disclosures included tax information of President Trump and thousands of other high-income individuals.Court filings said Littlejohn deliberately sought a contractor role to gain access to Trump’s tax returns and methodically learned how to extract data without raising internal alarms.The Treasury Department said it currently holds 31 contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, involving annual spending of $4.8 million and total obligations of $21 million.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the contracts were ended because the firm “failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service”.The move effectively cuts Booz Allen off from Treasury-related work linked to taxpayer data.A representative of Booz Allen Hamilton was not immediately available for comment, as reported AP.","The decision comes amid broader efforts by the Trump administration to act against entities it views as having failed to protect the president’s interests or sensitive government information.

Yen rebound hits Japanese exporters

Mixed performance across Asian markets

US futures dip amid tariff uncertainty

Wall Street ends week mixed

Commodities jump as investors seek safety

Asian stock markets mostly declined on Monday, led by sharp losses in Japan after the yen strengthened against the US dollar, hurting exporter stocks.Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 1.8% to 52,870.15, weighed down by heavy selling in major exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp., whose shares dropped 4%.Markets across the region remained cautious amid currency volatility, uncertainty over US trade policies and ahead of a key US Federal Reserve policy decision later this week.The sell-off in Japan came after the yen staged a strong rebound against the dollar in recent days. A weaker yen typically supports Japanese exporters by boosting the value of overseas earnings, but the recent currency move reversed that advantage.The dollar slipped to 154.27 yen from 155.01 yen, after trading near 158 yen last week, reported AP.The move followed comments from Japanese and US officials signalling close coordination on currency movements, fuelling expectations of possible intervention to support the yen.“Intervention chatter did the trick. Since Friday, the yen has staged a sharp rebound on expectations that Japanese authorities — possibly with US coordination — would step in,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, was quoted as saying by news agency AP.Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea’s Kospi slipped 0.7% to 4,955.79. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng edged down less than 0.1% to 26,735.54, while China’s Shanghai Composite rose 0.1% to 4,141.31.Markets were closed in Australia, New Zealand, India and Indonesia due to holidays.US stock futures edged lower, reflecting ongoing uncertainty around Washington’s tariff policies.

EU's Huge Greenland Reveal After Trump Backs Off On Tariff Threat Over Invasion Protest

While US President Donald Trump 's tariff threats over Greenland dominated the narrative for broader equity markets last week, investors were hedging risks elsewhere. Only three weeks into 2026, the market pattern is similar to last year:Trump makes threats, markets start to show signs of upset then, as the tension de-escalates over a few days, stocks resume a grind higher. Meanwhile, away from the Trump-driven headlines that moved the broader indexes and the VIX, some investors were putting on hedges against geopolitical risks that could pressure shares of Chinese companies and against the potential for disappointing tech earnings.","US President Donald Trump's tariff threats over Greenland dominated the narrative for broader equity markets last week.

A massive winter storm disrupted air travel across the United States on Sunday, triggering widespread flight cancellations and delays at some of the country’s busiest airports and setting up what airlines warned would be a brutal travel day.The National Weather Service said late Saturday that widespread snow, sleet and freezing rain threatened nearly 180 million people more than half the US population across a vast stretch from the southern Rocky Mountains to New England.After sweeping through the southern US, forecasters said the storm was expected to intensify over the Northeast, dumping 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 centimetres) of snow from Washington through New York and Boston.The severe weather led to massive disruptions across the aviation network.More than 14,000 flights have been cancelled across the US since Saturday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware, with nearly 10,000 cancellations scheduled for Sunday alone, the Associated Press reported.Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport warned travellers on its website of widespread cancellations, noting that nearly all departing flights, 420 flights, or 99% were cancelled for the day.Major airport hubs including Dallas-Fort Worth, Charlotte, Philadelphia and Atlanta, home to the nation’s busiest airport, were hit, along with New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport.American Airlines cancelled over 1,400 flights on Sunday, about 45% of its scheduled operations, FlightAware data showed.Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines each reported more than 1,200 cancellations, while United Airlines cancelled over 860 flights. JetBlue scrapped more than 570 flights, accounting for roughly 71% of its schedule for the day.If you are already at the airport, airlines advise getting in line to speak with a customer service representative. If you are still at home or at a hotel, passengers should call or go online to contact the airline’s reservations staff. Travellers are also advised to research alternate flights while waiting to speak to an agent.Most airlines will rebook passengers on a later flight at no extra charge, subject to seat availability.Passengers can seek to be booked on another airline, but carriers are not required to place travellers on a competing airline’s flight. Some airlines, including major carriers, may offer rebooking on partner airlines, though availability is not guaranteed, the Associated Press reported.If a flight is cancelled and a passenger chooses not to travel or finds another way to reach their destination, the airline is legally required to issue a refund, even for non-refundable tickets. The rule applies regardless of the reason for the cancellation.","More than 14,000 flights have been cancelled across the US since Saturday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware.

How can passengers reach airline support more easily during major disruptions?

US air travel is seeing widespread disruptions as a powerful winter storm moves across large parts of the country, forcing at least 13,000 flight cancellations over the weekend and affecting major airports. Forecasters have warned that damage, particularly in areas hit by ice, could be catastrophic and comparable to a hurricane.By mid-morning on Saturday, flight cancellations had dominated departures from several major airports, with Memphis, Oklahoma City and Dallas–Fort Worth among the worst affected. Significant disruption was also reported in Austin, Charlotte and Nashville, while airports in Washington and New York were expected to see conditions worsen as the storm continued.Here is what you need to know:When airlines anticipate weather-related disruption, they often allow passengers to postpone trips by a few days without paying a change fee. For example, American Airlines is waiving change fees for passengers impacted by the storm and adding extra flights across the country to help travellers reach their destinations once conditions improve.Travellers are advised to search online for their airline’s name along with terms such as “travel alerts” to check for rescheduling offers.In case passengers need to proceed, they should use their airline’s app to confirm whether their flight is still operating before leaving for the airport. Cancellations can be announced hours or even days before departure.By mid-day Saturday, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines had each cancelled more than 1,000 scheduled Sunday flights, according to FlightAware. Oklahoma’s largest airport suspended all flights on Saturday. Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport saw more than 700 departing flights cancelled and nearly as many arriving flights called off. Disruptions were also reported at airports in Chicago, Atlanta, Nashville and Charlotte, North Carolina.Passengers at the airport should speak to a customer service representative. Those at home or in a hotel should contact the airline online or by phone. Travellers are encouraged to research alternative flights while waiting to speak to an agent.Most airlines will rebook passengers on a later flight at no additional charge, depending on seat availability. However, though most major carriers, say they can rebook passengers on partner airlines, this is not guaranteed.Yes. If a flight is cancelled and the passenger no longer wants to travel, or has found another way to reach the destination, the airline is legally required to issue a refund, even for non-refundable tickets. The reason for the cancellation does not matter.Passengers are entitled to a full ticket refund, as well as refunds for unused baggage fees, seat upgrades or other extras. Airlines may offer travel credits, but passengers are entitled to a cash refund.According to the US Department of Transportation, refunds for credit card payments must be issued within seven business days after a passenger declines an alternative flight or voucher. Refunds for tickets purchased with cash or cheque must be issued within 20 calendar days.US airlines are not required to compensate passengers for meals or lodging when flights are cancelled or significantly delayed due to an “uncontrollable” event such as bad weather.Customer service phone lines are often overwhelmed during major storms. Travellers can try using priority phone numbers linked to higher frequent-flyer status or calling an airline’s international support number, where agents can often assist with rebooking.","US air travel is seeing widespread disruptions as a powerful winter storm moves across large parts of the country.

America's push for rare earths

The US government is set to acquire a 10% stake in Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth, as part of Trump administration's $1.6 billion investment. The package is aimed towards supporting the firm to develop a local mine and magnet production facility, according to two sources familiar with the deal.In addition to this government-backed investment, USA Rare Earth is also securing a separate $1 billion private funding round, which, along with the public announcement, is expected on Monday, Reuters reported. The company will also host a morning conference call with investors to discuss the terms.Rare earth minerals, a group of 17 elements critical for electronics and military equipment, are largely processed by China. The output from United States, however, remains limited, prompting Washington to make efforts to expand domestic production.Under the investment terms, the US government will receive 16.1 million shares in USA Rare Earth, along with warrants for an additional 17.6 million shares. Both are priced at $17.17 per share, close to the company’s trading level earlier this month.For fundraising support, USA Rare Earth has enlisted Cantor Fitzgerald, chaired by Brandon Lutnick, the son of US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick, a source was quoted as saying by Reuters.At present, USA Rare Earth is developing a mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas, in collaboration with Texas Mineral Resources, expected to begin operations by 2028. Its magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma, is scheduled to start later this year.This latest investment follows previous equity stakes taken by the Trump administration in MP Materials , Lithium Americas , and Trilogy Metals. A senior Trump official told Reuters last month that more “historic deals” with the US mining sector are planned to increase production of lithium, rare earths, and other critical minerals vital to national defence, artificial intelligence, and related industries.","The US government is set to acquire a 10% stake in Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth, as part of Trump administration's $1.6 billion investment.

US Fed set to keep rates steady as officials defend independence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-fed-set-to-keep-rates-steady-as-officials-defend-independence/articleshow/127444298.cms,"External pressure

The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it meets in the coming week, holding firm despite President Donald Trump's pressure to slash levels as it guards against threats to its independence.The central bank has cut rates three consecutive times since September as the jobs market weakened, bringing them to a range between 3.50 percent and 3.75 percent.But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the bar would be higher for a further reduction in January. They meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.""The fact that growth is strong, unemployment is low, equity markets are close to all-time highs and inflation is above target all argue for a pause,"" said analysts at ING bank.Powell's robust defense of Fed independence in response to ongoing pressure from Trump to lower rates confirms this, ING added.On January 11, Powell released a rare, solemn statement revealing that the Department of Justice was investigating him over a $2.5 billion renovation of the bank's headquarters.He slammed the threat of criminal charges as the result of policymakers setting rates in the public's best interests -- rather than bowing to the president's wishes.Trump has made no secret of his disdain for Powell, claiming there is ""no inflation"" and repeatedly questioning the Fed chair's competence and integrity.Yet, US inflation has been well above the bank's two-percent target for over five years, said former Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester.""I think the Fed needs to keep a pretty tight eye on where the inflation is going,"" she told AFP.Price increases could cool after Trump's trade tariffs filter through the world's biggest economy, but Mester flagged the need for ""more convincing evidence.""Meanwhile, existing cost hikes have brought about a ""large wedge"" between how affluent and lower-income households view the economy, said KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk.Even if the gap could temporarily narrow as fiscal stimulus hits in early 2026 -- with a rise in tax refunds incoming due to tax cut expansions -- this could ""cause a more entrenched bout of inflation,"" she warned.Another complication is stagnating employment, forcing policymakers to walk a tightrope between lowering rates to boost the economy and keeping them higher to curb inflation.The Fed meets eight times a year to consider interest rate levels, and Michael Pearce of Oxford Economics said the dilemma it faces has eased.Figures suggest that risks to the labor market appear less pressing than a few months ago, while the likelihood of rising inflation also seems to have moderated, he said in a note.Nonetheless, events outside of the rate-setting committee ""have the potential to shake up the path of monetary policy,"" Pearce added.Besides the probe into Powell, Trump has sought to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, sparking a legal battle crucial to shaping how much discretion the president has in changing the Fed's leadership.A president can only fire Fed board members ""for cause,"" traditionally understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty.But the Trump administration appears to be pushing a broader interpretation, as Trump moved to fire Cook over mortgage fraud allegations she denies.The Supreme Court heard arguments on the issue on Wednesday, and Cook stressed in a statement afterwards the importance of insulating the Fed from political threats.She said her case is about whether the Fed will set rates ""guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure.""Pearce flagged a ""small risk"" that the government succeeds in ousting Cook, saying this could ""pave the way for a substantial dovish transformation on the committee over time.""Policymakers seen as ""hawkish"" favor higher rates to fight inflation, while a ""dovish"" Fed tends towards lower levels.Analysts expect Powell to avoid discussing political issues at his press briefing after the two-day Fed meeting on Wednesday, while divisions remain over the path of future policy.","The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it meets in the coming week.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

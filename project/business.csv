The rally came as traders turned towards the long-running artificial intelligence boom and hopes for more US interest rate cuts.Nikkei soared over 1,419 points or 2.8% to reach at 51, 759. In South Korea, Kospi was up 2.66% to trade at 4,424 at 8:30 AM IST. Shanghai and Shenzhen were up 0.9% and 1.77%, respectively. Hong Kong's HSI was flat with 0.16% gains at 26,381.Equity markets continued their upward momentum from last year, driven by strong demand for artificial intelligence-related stocks. Japan’s Nikkei was led by gains in technology heavyweights, with SoftBank rising about four percent and Tokyo Electron advancing five percent.At the same time, gold prices moved higher, while oil prices, which had slipped earlier in the session, managed to recover some ground. The market moves followed a dramatic US military operation in Caracas early on Saturday, during which American forces struck military installations and transported Maduro and his wife to New York to face federal narcotrafficking charges.The situation has sharpened focus on Venezuela’s energy sector.As the holder of the world’s largest proven oil reserves, Venezuela’s potential return to higher output levels has raised concerns that additional crude supply could worsen global oversupply and further weigh on oil prices.Crude benchmarks also recovered after early weakness in Asian trade. Brent crude rose 0.28% to $60.92 a barrel, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate edged up 0.16% to $57.41.US President Donald Trump said Washington would now “run” Venezuela, with American companies expected to step in to repair the country’s heavily degraded oil infrastructure. Analysts, however, have warned that restoring output will be a long and costly process, clouded by broader uncertainty about the country’s future.Years of sanctions and under-investment have sharply reduced Venezuela’s oil production, which now stands at around one million barrels per day, compared with approximately 3.5 million barrels per day in 1999.“Any recovery in production would require substantial investment given the crumbling infrastructure resulting from years of mismanagement and underinvestment,” UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo told AFP.The outlook for fresh investment remains challenging. Oil prices have been under pressure from a global supply glut and fell in 2025, even as the market grappled with major growth headwinds including Trump’s tariff war and the war in Ukraine.Safe-haven gold also attracted buying interest, rising 1.28% to $4,388 per ounce.","Nikkei soared over 1,419 points or 2.8% to reach at 51, 759.

'Really painful on the wallet'

Peak travel season

Caribbean air travel erupted into chaos over the weekend after US military captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, prompting sweeping airspace restrictions across the region.According to FlightRadar24, no commercial aircraft were flying over Venezuelan airspace on Saturday. The US Federal Aviation Administration also imposed restrictions that forced major airlines to cancel hundreds of flights across the eastern Caribbean, disrupting travel during an already busy holiday period. Airlines warned passengers that delays and cancellations could continue for several days.US transportation secretary Sean Duffy said the FAA acted in the interest of passenger safety. In a post on social media, he said “the FAA restricted the airspace in the Caribbean and Venezuela to ensure the SAFETY of the flying public.”“When appropriate, these airspace restrictions will be lifted,” he added on the social platform X. “Please work with your airlines directly if your flight has been impacted.”Services were cancelled or suspended to and from several major destinations, including:Airlines said they were waiving change fees for travellers forced to alter their plans.Aruba’s Queen Beatrix International Airport, located just 15 miles (24 kilometres) off Venezuela’s coast and popular with US holidaymakers, saw widespread cancellations on Saturday, according to airport authorities, normal operations were expected to resume on Sunday.The disruption extended beyond aviation. In Barbados, PM Mia Mottley said that the situation had affected both air and sea entry points. Speaking at a news conference, she said “the consequences of the conflict have been exceedingly disruptive to both of our ports of entry,” referring to the country’s airport and its cruise ship terminal.Earlier, the FAA said it had imposed a temporary airspace restriction affecting Puerto Rico’s main international airport and surrounding areas. A statement posted on X by Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan said the move was due to the “security situation related to military activity” in Venezuela.Most commercial flights operated by US airlines to and from the airport were suspended or cancelled as a result, although foreign airlines and military aircraft were exempt from the restriction.About 215 flights were cancelled “due to airspace closures across the Caribbean related to military activity.” However, services to destinations further west, including the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, were unaffected. Customers were offered rebooking options or refunds.Modifying its schedule to account for the closures and allowing passengers to change travel plans without fees as it continued to monitor the situation in coordination with US aviation authorities.Cancelled all flights to Aruba on Saturday and suspended services to Puerto Rico until further notice, while flights to the Dominican Republic continued.Waiving change fees for flights to and from around 20 island destinations, including Anguilla, Antigua, Curacao, Saint Lucia, and the US and British Virgin Islands.Issued a travel waiver for customers travelling through 13 affected airports until Tuesday.Cancelled flights affecting thousands of passengers but planned to resume services on Sunday to Curacao, Aruba, Bonaire and other Caribbean destinations.For many travellers, the impact was immediate. Lou Levine and his family were due to return to the Washington, DC, area from Puerto Rico on Saturday morning when they discovered their JetBlue flight had been cancelled. Attempts to rebook by phone failed, and the family later turned to social media for help.Eventually, JetBlue rebooked them on a flight departing the following Saturday, extending what was meant to be a week-long New Year holiday into a two-week stay.Levine said that his employer had been accommodating, but the disruption has come at a cost as his daughter will now miss a week of high school, and the family will have to undergo additional expenses.“I love it here. But we have dog-sitting and cat-sitting and car rental. It’s fine. It’s just really painful on the wallet,” Levine said.The family hopes to secure an earlier return if flights resume sooner.The cancellations came shortly after the peak holiday travel period, during which, according to AAA, nearly 122.4 million Americans travelled at least 50 miles from home. However, many travellers were still in the Caribbean, attempting to return ahead of work and school commitments.“The Caribbean is a top destination this time of the year,” said AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz. “We do have a lot of people who are trying to get back home this weekend ahead of work and school on Monday.”Diaz urged travellers to stay informed and allow airlines to send updates, noting that while “it’s understandable we want to unplug,” monitoring developments remains important.","US military captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, prompting sweeping airspace restrictions across the region.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened flat in trade on Monday amidst mixed global cues. While Nifty50 was above 26,300, BSE Sensex was near 85,700. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,323.95, down 5 points or 0.017%. BSE Sensex was at 85,710.66, down 51 points or 0.060%.The focus this week is on a data calendar, both in India and overseas, as markets move into the early stage of the earnings season. Domestically, investors will track the final readings of the HSBC Services PMI and Composite PMI for cues on economic momentum.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The year 2026 has begun with major geopolitical developments which can have profound consequences. The US action in Venezuela has the potential to further destabilise global geopolitics. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is likely to linger longer; there can be worsening of the protests in Iran and how the Iranian regime reacts to that in the context of threat of intervention by Trump; and perhaps even China might use this time of huge uncertainty for annexation of Taiwan. The huge uncertainty and unpredictability of geopolitics will influence the market, too.We will have to wait and watch how things unfold.”“A positive for India from the Venezuelan crisis is that its medium to long-term impact is bearish for crude. The market is likely to remain resilient in the near-term since we are at an all time high and the momentum might support the bulls. The Bank Nifty is strong and has fundamental support from impressive credit growth. Q3 results of the banking and financials segment will be good.”Global markets offered support after Wall Street closed higher on Friday. The Dow and the S&P 500 ended the session in green, snapping their four day losing streak at the start of 2026, led by gains in technology and industrial stocks such as Nvidia, Intel and Boeing.Asian equities also advanced, touching record levels as investors continued to favour technology shares.In commodities, oil prices showed mild gains on Monday as traders assessed the potential impact of political turmoil in OPEC member Venezuela on crude shipments, following the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by the Donald Trump administration.On the domestic institutional front, foreign portfolio investors were net buyers of Indian equities worth Rs 289 crore on Friday, while domestic institutional investors purchased shares worth Rs 677 crore, providing additional support to the market.","The focus this week is on a data calendar, both in India and overseas, as markets move into the early stage of the earnings season.

India’s imports of crude petroleum from the US in the first eight months of the current fiscal registered a year-on-year increase of more than 92% compared with the same period in 2024, with Russia remaining the biggest supplier of the product between April and Nov 2025.As per data from the ministry of commerce and industry, India imported 178.1 million tonnes of crude between April and Nov 2025, of which 60 million tonnes came from Russia and 13 million tonnes from the US. During the same period in 2024, India had imported 165 million tonnes of oil, which comprised 62.4 million tonnes from Russia and just 7.1 million tonnes from the US.While the US’s share in India’s oil imports increased from 4.3% during April-Nov 2024 to 7.6%, during the same period in the ongoing financial year, Russia’s contribution fell from 37.9% in the last fiscal year to 33.7% in the current one.Apart from Russia and the US, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Nigeria and Kuwait are the biggest exporters of crude oil to India.

'Can Raise Tariffs Very Quickly': Trump Warns India Over Russian Oil Imports, Praises PM Modi

US President Donald Trump on Monday issued a fresh tariff warning to India, saying Washington could raise duties on New Delhi if it does not “help on Russian oil issue,” directly linking the threat to the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war.“We could raise tariffs on India if they don't have help on Russian oil issue,” said US President Trump, quoted by Reuters.US President Donald Trump added, ""They wanted to make me happy, basically...

Revenue growth of Indian IT services companies is expected to remain muted in the third quarter of the current financial year 2026, even as operating performance stays resilient, according to a report by Centrum.The report comes ahead of the Q3FY26 earnings season, which is set to begin next week.The report noted that revenue growth during the quarter is likely to be modest, though resilient, supported by healthy traction in select verticals such as Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) and Technology. The ramp-up of recently signed deals is also expected to aid performance.However, overall growth is likely to remain subdued, with Tier 2 IT companies expected to outperform Tier 1 players during the quarter.It stated ""Revenue growth to remain muted with select Tier 2 outperforming Tier 1 companies""According to the report, revenue growth for Tier 1 IT companies in Q3FY26 is expected to be in the range of +0.2 per cent to +1.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter in US dollar terms.The report highlighted that the Indian rupee depreciated by around 2.1 per cent against the US dollar on a quarter-on-quarter basis during Q3FY26, which is expected to support INR-based reported revenue growth.At the same time, cross-currency headwinds during the quarter stood at 20-40 basis points for companies under coverage.On the margin front, the report expects operating margins to remain broadly steady. The 2.1 per cent depreciation of the rupee against the dollar is likely to provide support to margins, even as companies face lower utilisation due to furloughs and a seasonally weak quarter. Q3 is typically impacted by furloughs and a lower number of working days, which affects utilisation levels across the sector.The report noted that IT companies continue to focus on efficiency measures such as improving the employee pyramid, optimising subcontracting costs, increasing utilisation, and other cost-control initiatives.These steps are aimed at supporting margin stability, even as companies continue to invest in building capabilities in new-age technologies.The report added that the demand environment has remained largely unchanged over the past three months.The focus during the quarter remains on ramping up recently signed deals, which are largely driven by cost optimisation and vendor consolidation.The report also highlighted that the adoption of AI tools is expected to improve revenue per employee, thereby supporting overall productivity for IT services companies in Q3FY26.","Muted revenue growth likely for IT firms in Q3FY26 results, margins to stay resilient: Report.

Indian carriers to induct about 100 aircraft annually for 15 years: Minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-carriers-to-induct-about-100-aircraft-annually-for-15-years-minister/articleshow/126342136.cms,"BHOGAPURAM: With more mega airports coming up in India, the country has decided to use a multi-pronged strategy to give a boost to international flights from these upcoming hubs. Instead of just raising bilaterals or flying rights with other countries to have more flights to foreign shores, the Modi govt is keen both Indian airports and airlines realise their true potential by flying direct between hubs here and abroad.“Every 40-45 days we are seeing airport capacity expansion in the form of new airports or existing ones being expanded. India has 843 aircraft as of now. In calendar year 2025, Indian carriers inducted 80 planes. This year 106 more aircraft are expected to be inducted. For the next 10-15 years, Indian carriers will induct about 100 aircraft annually given the orders of airlines like AI Group, IndiGo and Akasa. Star Air is planning to order more planes,” Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said at Bhogapuram Airport, which received its first commercial validation flight (by Air India) on Sunday.For many decades, a lion’s share of international traffic between India and rest of the world has been on home airlines of hubs nearby — like Emirates at Dubai; Qatar Airways at Doha; Etihad at Doha; Sri Lankan at Colombo; Singapore Airlines at Changi and European carriers.Some of these hubs get a significant chunk of their footfalls from people travelling between India and rest of them world. Since 2014, the Modi govt has been working to get this traffic back to Indian airlines and Indian airports. While new airports are coming up, Tatas taking over Air India and IndiGo’s international ambitions along with newcomers like Akasa have made that a distinct possibility.“As far as (raising) bilaterals goes, we have to give priority to our own airlines. Thanks to the new age infrastructure rapidly being created, India is now in a position that travellers from nearby countries fly here and then take connecting flights to other parts of the world. Similarly, there’s a huge potential t fly in people from within India to the global hubs we are creating and then they take overseas flights from there. India has the airports required for the job and our airlines are getting there with the right policies in place,” the minister said.But he added “Indian airlines need to operate more wide body aircraft (to fly nonstop between India and rest of the world). Emirates, for instance, has 250 wide bodies while Indian carriers (primarily Air India) are in double dights. AI Group and IndiGo have wide bodies on order and we want Indian carriers to be able to fly direct between our hubs and those abroad.”While Indian carriers want govt to rationalise enhancing bilaterals, operators of some new hubs have been seeking a revision as the same to many places, including Dubai and Singapore, are completely used ay airlines of both sides — which means they can’t add more flights.Naidu termed “global south” and Africa as key areas for increasing direct connectivity to from India.Naidu on the first commercial validation flight that landed at the upcoming Bhogapuram Airport on Sunday.

Travel insurance takes off after pandemic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/travel-insurance-takes-off-after-pandemic/articleshow/126342131.cms,"Representative image

CHENNAI: What was once seen as optional is increasingly viewed as essential: uptake of overseas travel insurance among Indian outbound travellers has nearly doubled in six years, driven by rising medical costs abroad and heightened awareness of travel disruptions in the post-pandemic era.According to Irdai’s annual report, 96.7 lakh lives were covered under 27.9 lakh overseas travel insurance policies during 2024–25. The gross premium income from the overseas travel insurance business for FY25 stood at Rs 1,267 crore.This marks a substantial jump of 91% compared with 2018-19, when 50.5 lakh lives were covered through 25.8 lakh overseas travel insurance policies. Over the same six-year period, gross premium income from the overseas travel insurance business rose by 67.4%, from Rs 757 crore in FY19. The market share of private general insurers in overseas travel insurance gross premium also increased from 81% in FY19 to 84% in FY25.Meet Kapadia, head of travel insurance at Policybazaar, said the growth reflects a clear shift in how Indians are planning international travel. “The pandemic may have been the trigger, but the sustained rise indicates that Indian travellers are now travelling with a sharper understanding of risk.Medical treatment overseas can be five to eight times more expensive than in India, even for non-critical care. Beyond medical emergencies, recent flight disruptions have also made the financial impact of delays, missed connections and extended stays far more pronounced,” he added.Dev Karvat, founder and CEO of Asego, a global assistance and travel insurance provider, said leisure travellers form the largest segment of international travellers seeking overseas medical insurance, while business travellers, students and long-term travellers, including professionals on overseas assignments, also opt for it. “Senior citizens are an increasingly important segment, with rising outbound travel among older Indians driving demand for specialised medical coverage and dependable emergency assistance,” he added.The India Tourism Statistics report by the ministry of tourism shows that Indian outbound departures rose 14.7% from 2.7 crore in 2019 to just over 3 crore in 2024. Overseas travel insurance uptake has increased steadily despite not being universally mandatory, though it is required for certain destinations such as Schengen countries as part of visa norms.Ravi Gosain, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators, said the growth in overseas travel insurance reflects the strong revival of outbound travel from India.","According to Irdai’s annual report, 96.7 lakh lives were covered under 27.9 lakh overseas travel insurance policies during 2024–25.

‘Obesity therapy mkt set to evolve rapidly’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/obesity-therapy-mkt-set-to-evolve-rapidly/articleshow/126342116.cms,"Representative image

Danish firm Novo Nordisk expects India’s obesity therapy market to evolve rapidly, saying its recent Wegovy (injectable semaglutide) price cut could lift patient uptake five-to-seven-fold, echoing its insulin experience. This comes even as lower-priced generics loom, with a rival drugmaker, Eli Lilly & Co, also eyeing a share of one of the fastest-growing therapy segments.“Our recent price cut wasn’t about generics — it was about improving access. When we cut insulin prices in 2020 by 30%, patient uptake increased five to seven times over five years. We expect a similar impact here,” Vikrant Shrotriya, managing director at Novo Nordisk India, told TOI in an exclusive interaction. He added that uptake in semaglutide could accelerate faster, given the scale of unmet need in obesity treatment.Analysts expect with the patent expiry of semaglutide in March in India, emerging markets and regulated markets (Brazil, Canada) could create an incremental Rs 5000-crore opportunity for generic versions (global and domestic) over the next 12-15 months.“For FY27E, we see this as a Rs 1000-2000 crore incremental revenue opportunity in India’s branded formulation space,” a Systematix analyst said.The company slashed the price of Wegovy in Nov last year by up to 37% from its launch price, aiming to gain ground in one of the world’s fastest-growing obesity treatment markets ahead of the expected entry of generics.Novo, a pioneer and a dominant market player in insulin analogues globally, introduced its obesity and diabetes therapies — Wegovy, followed by Ozempic, last year in India.Responding to a query on the impact on pricing with the generics’ entry, he said, “The market will be competitive and evolve rapidly — like AI adoption. Multiple players will enter, benefiting patients through better access and services. We aim to be the preferred partner for doctors and patients, focusing on quality, reliability, and education.”Further, in Dec 2025, US Food and Drug Administration approved oral semaglutide, expanding Novo Nordisk’s obesity treatment portfolio beyond the shot. The company plans to launch the Wegovy pill in the US this month, and will evaluate its launch (here) based on global uptake and production capacity.Shrotriya, a Novo Nordisk veteran of 25 years and India MD since 2020, said, “India has always been a priority. We were among the first to set up shared services here 20 years ago. Today, we have the largest diabetes care franchise in India, and five of our brands are among the top 100 in the country.”",Danish firm Novo Nordisk expects India’s obesity therapy market to evolve rapidly. Its recent Wegovy (injectable semaglutide) price cut could lift patient uptake five-to-seven-fold. This comes even as lower-priced generics loom.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126342117,imgsize-43092,width-400,resizemode-4/obesity-and-physical-inactivity.jpg"

MUMBAI: Electricity, chemicals and metals accounted for 60% of the proposed investments in terms of sectors while in terms of geography, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Maharashtra account for half of the total investments proposed in the country in the first nine months of FY26.According to a Bank of Baroda Economic Research note, new investment announcements between April and Dec aggregated Rs 26.62 lakh crore, exceeding the Rs 23.88 lakh crore of expected investments recorded in the corresponding period in 2024. The report said there were “clear signs of a pick-up in investment intentions in the country this year,” aided by a supportive policy environment and easing financial conditions.Nearly 48% of announced investments originated from infrastructure-oriented industries, while chemicals accounted for another 22%. In contrast, consumer-oriented industries accounted for less than 3% of total announcements. “Investment has been predominantly in the capital goods industries with the front end being provided by infrastructure,” the note said, while adding that a sustained recovery in consumption could eventually broaden the investment base.Electricity emerged as the single-largest sector, accounting for 22.6% of total investment announcements, marginally ahead of chemicals and chemical products at 21.8%, and metals and metal products at 17.3%.Information technology and transport services completed the top five, together taking the cumulative share of these sectors to around 80% of total announced investments. The report noted that “power is the dominant sector with renewables leading the pack,” adding that this was “an effective indicator of how seriously the economy is looking at environment issues. ”A state-wise break-up showed a sharp concentration of proposed investments in a handful of regions. Andhra Pradesh alone accounted for 25.3% of total investment intentions during the period, followed by Odisha at 13.1% and Maharashtra at 12.8%. Telangana and Gujarat contributed 9.5% and 7.1%, respectively, taking the combined share of the top five states to around 68%.Over time, as investment becomes more broad-based, “the present skew towards infrastructure will reduce,” and investment activity could spread more evenly across states, the report noted.","Electricity, chemicals and metals accounted for 60% of the proposed investments in terms of sectors.

Bottom line: A golden year that redefined markets

Dubai’s gold market delivered a giant surprise in 2025, marking one of the most dramatic rallies in recent history. What started as a modest year for bullion turned into a breakout performance, with the price of 24-carat gold climbing by more than Dh200 per gram and delivering massive gains for investors, collectors and everyday residents alike.According to market data, the price of 24K gold opened the year at Dh318 per gram on January 1, 2025 and finished the year at Dh520 per gram on December 31, a jump of roughly 63.5 percent. This means that anyone holding physical gold throughout the year saw the value of their holdings rise by more than Dh200 per gram.The 22-carat variant also saw remarkable gains, climbing from about Dh294.50 to Dh481.50 per gram, roughly a Dh187 increase, while even 21K gold rose around Dh176.75 per gram over the same period.By contrast, the newly introduced 14K gold, launched in the UAE on November 29, posted a more modest 2.3 percent gain, reflecting its lighter weight and broader affordability for everyday wear.Several economic forces came together in 2025 to fuel this dramatic upswing. Given the safe-haven demand, global investors and central banks including those in the Gulf, shifted capital into gold as a hedge against market uncertainty and geopolitical risk, a pattern seen throughout 2025.According to reports, gold’s rally in 2025 was the strongest annual performance since the late 1970s, with prices soaring nearly 70 percent globally.Interest rate dynamics with expectations of lower US Federal Reserve interest rates and the appeal of non-yielding assets helped lift gold’s allure. Lower real yields often make gold more attractive relative to bonds and other financial instruments.The Central Bank of the UAE increased its gold holdings significantly in 2025, growing reserves by about 26 percent to nearly $7.9 billion as global economic uncertainty persisted, a historic move that underscored gold’s strategic value. These factors combined to create a strong backdrop for prices, pushing bullion sharply higher even as other asset classes posted uneven returns.For residents and investors in Dubai, long accustomed to the Gold Souk’s bustling trade and precious-metal culture, the surge translated into real-world gains. Retail buyers saw both jewellery and bullion values climb, lifting the wealth of long-term holders. With 24K gold prices consistently near or above Dh520 per gram in late December and into early 2026, bullion became a focal point for investment as much as adornment.At the same time, short-term volatility such as a near Dh18 drop in just one day toward the end of the year due to profit-booking in global markets, reflected how active trading and profit-taking can influence local UAE prices even amid a strong overall rally. Jewellers and bullion dealers across Dubai’s famous Gold Souk and regional markets noted the heightened interest, particularly from expatriate buyers and Middle Eastern investors seeking to protect wealth in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. The UAE’s competitive pricing environment, where making charges and taxes are relatively low, further incentivises local and international buyers alike.Dubai’s gold price story fits into a broader global trend. Precious metals surged worldwide in 2025 as investors raced toward safe havens amid geopolitical unrest and economic concerns. Gold topped record levels over $4,300 per ounce internationally, one of the metal’s best annual performances in decades.Analysts and major institutions such as Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs forecast continued strength through 2026 and beyond, with projections ranging from $4,000 to over $4,900 per ounce by year-end, supported by sustained central bank buying and geopolitical tension. This global backdrop helped lift sentiment in Dubai and the broader Gulf, where gold remains culturally and economically significant.After a spectacular run in 2025, markets are closely watching how 2026 unfolds. Early data suggests that gold prices continued to hold near high levels in early January 2026, even after slight profit-taking in global markets. Forecasts by international analysts suggest continued upside potential if geopolitical risks and safe-haven demand remain strong. For Gulf investors, this means that gold remains a key hedge and wealth preserver, not just a jewellery purchase.Dubai’s gold surge in 2025, with 24K climbing more than 60 percent, marked a rare standout year for precious metals. From record price gains to heightened global demand and strong central bank involvement, gold’s rally reflected broader economic and geopolitical forces at play. As 2026 begins, many investors and analysts see bullion continuing to play a central role as a store of value, especially in a world marked by uncertainty and shifting financial landscapes.","Dubai’s gold market delivered a giant surprise in 2025, marking one of the most dramatic rallies in recent history.

The January 2026 US military operation in Venezuela, culminating in President Nicolás Maduro’s capture, has reverberated far beyond geopolitics, drawing intense scrutiny from energy markets including in the Middle East , where oil remains the economic backbone of many nations. While headlines have fixated on the diplomatic fallout, analysts from UBS, Energy Aspects, Kpler and the International Energy Agency (IEA) have offered grounded insight into how this event really affects global oil pricing, supply and market risk, with clear implications for Gulf producers and consumers alike.Despite Venezuela’s status as home to the world’s largest proven oil reserves, its current actual production is only about 900,000–1.1 million barrels per day, roughly 1% of global supply. This figure is far below its historic peak due to decades of underinvestment and sanctions.Giovanni Staunovo, a strategist at Swiss bank UBS, told The National that because Venezuela is no longer a major exporter, “a US attack is unlikely to trigger a material supply crisis.” He noted that while the oil market could see short-term jitters, the impact on prices is modest because Venezuela’s exports are already under pressure from sanctions and logistical constraints.Meanwhile, Vandana Hari, chief executive of Singapore-based Vanda Insights, described the oil price response as similarly muted, “There is not much beyond another uptick in the Venezuela risk premium,” reinforcing the idea that markets are pricing geopolitical uncertainty rather than immediate physical supply disruptions.A key reason for restrained market reaction is the ongoing global supply dynamics that have shaped oil pricing throughout 2025 and into 2026.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the oil market was already forecast to be in surplus in 2026, with supply expected to exceed demand by several million barrels per day due to strong production from OPEC+, the United States and other non-OPEC producers. This oversupply undercuts the potential for a dramatic price spike even after geopolitical shocks.This means that even though Venezuela’s political turmoil adds uncertainty, it arrives in a market where supply fundamentals are softening price pressures rather than amplifying them.For Middle Eastern producers, this context matters. Gulf oil exporters including Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait, hold significant control over global supply capacity. Their combined output dwarfs Venezuela’s current contribution and tighter production coordination through OPEC+ has helped temper price volatility in recent years.Even after the US action, an OPEC+ meeting in early January 2026 reaffirmed steady output levels, prioritising market stability as political uncertainties outweighed fundamental supply shifts. Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, noted, “Right now, oil markets are being driven less by supply-demand fundamentals and more by political uncertainty,” underscoring how Gulf producers are maintaining calm rather than reacting to headlines.Although Venezuelan crude is a small part of global flows, its quality, predominantly heavy and sour, makes it a valuable feedstock for certain refineries, especially along the US Gulf Coast. This nuance emerged in detailed market commentary. Rystad Energy and others point out that Venezuelan heavy crude cannot be easily replaced by lighter grades, which could exert subtle pressure on specific market segments even if overall crude pricing stays stable.From a Middle Eastern perspective, this is noteworthy because heavy crude from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the UAE competes in many of the same refining markets. Any future shift in Venezuelan production, especially if sanctions are eased and output restored, could influence how heavy crude competes in Asia and the Americas, even if global price benchmarks remain anchored primarily by supply from the Gulf and other major producers.An Associated Press-cited analysis points to the long-term challenge that rebuilding Venezuela’s oil industry will require decades and tens of billions of dollars in investment, even under a favourable political environment. This means that while a restored Venezuelan role in global markets could eventually increase supply, it is not a near-term driver.For the Middle East, this reinforces two key lessons for 2026. Short-term price responses remain muted because Venezuela’s current output is small and markets were already well supplied heading into the year. Long-term market dynamics could shift gradually only if Venezuelan production increases substantially, a process that is likely multi-year and contingent on political stability, legal clarity and major foreign capital inflows.Ongoing developments that Gulf investors and policymakers should monitor include:Far from fuel-price shocks seen during past geopolitical crises, analysts from UBS, Vanda Insights, Rystad Energy and the IEA suggest the US attack on Venezuela is likely to have only limited short-term impact on oil prices because of existing oversupply and Venezuela’s small current production share. However, the event does heighten geopolitical risk premiums and underscores longer-term uncertainties about how and when Venezuela might re-enter global energy markets, a development that Middle Eastern oil producers and refiners will be tracking closely in 2026 and beyond.","The January 2026 US military operation in Venezuela, culminating in President Nicolás Maduro’s capture, has reverberated far beyond geopolitics.

Venezuela Invasion: 150 American Aircraft, 30 Mins & Maduro:Trump’s 'Op Absolute Resolve' | Timeline

US President Donald Trump’s idea of taking control of Venezuela’s oil industry and inviting US companies to rebuild it after the capture of President Nicolás Maduro is unlikely to move global oil prices in the near term, analysts say.As per news agency AP, Venezuela’s oil sector has been hollowed out by years of neglect, mismanagement and sanctions, meaning any meaningful jump in production would take time and heavy investment.Although some damage from recent US military action appears limited, analysts caution that the country’s oil infrastructure has been deteriorating for years. “It has been decaying for many many years and will take time to rebuild,” Patrick De Haan, lead petroleum analyst at GasBuddy, as per AP.Current output stands at about 1.1 million barrels per day, far below historical levels, though some experts believe production could eventually double or even triple if conditions improve.A key hurdle is political stability. American oil companies are unlikely to commit billions of dollars unless there is clarity on who governs Venezuela and whether contracts will be honoured.Uncertainty remains after Trump claimed the United States is now in charge, while Venezuela’s vice president had argued Maduro should be restored to power before the country’s top court named her interim leader.If the US manages to establish control quickly, optimism could rise. Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said that if Washington appears to be running the country even for a short period, US energy firms may be encouraged to step in and revive production, according to AP.Over time, a stronger Venezuelan oil sector could help keep global prices lower and increase pressure on Russia, he added.Oil markets were closed over the weekend, and analysts do not expect sharp price moves when trading resumes. Venezuela’s production is already factored into OPEC output, and the global market is currently well supplied, limiting the immediate impact.Venezuela holds the world’s largest proven crude reserves, estimated at about 303 billion barrels, roughly 17 per cent of global reserves, according to US energy data cited by AP.That scale explains why international oil companies remain interested. Chevron is currently the only US firm with significant operations in the country, producing around 250,000 barrels a day through joint ventures with state-owned PDVSA.ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips exited Venezuela in 2007 after then president Hugo Chávez nationalised much of the sector.Chevron said it remains focused on employee safety and compliance with laws, while ConocoPhillips said it is monitoring developments but would not speculate on future investments, AP reported.Experts stress that the challenge is less about finding oil and more about trust and stability.“How do you get foreign companies to start pouring money in before they have a clear perspective on the political stability, the contract situation and the like,” asked Francisco Monaldi of Rice University.Even with massive reserves, Venezuela produces less than 1 per cent of global supply.Corruption, sanctions and underinvestment saw output slide from 3.5 million barrels a day in 1999 to current levels. Reaching four million barrels a day could take around a decade and require about $100 billion in investment, Monaldi said.Venezuela’s heavy crude is particularly valuable for producing diesel and asphalt, fuels that are in tight supply globally.As per news agency AFP, US refineries along the Gulf Coast are well-suited to process this type of oil, making access to Venezuelan crude attractive.","Venezuela's oil sector has been hollowed out by years of neglect, mismanagement and sanctions.

Why it matters



""We'll be selling large amounts of oil.""



Why Venezuela’s oil is hard to revive



Chevron, Conoco - and cautious capital



Between the lines: No immediate global oil shock



India’s direct exposure: Now marginal



Why India remains insulated - for now



Low trade base: With bilateral trade already marginal, disruptions in Venezuela won’t materially affect India’s import basket. Diversified sourcing: India has diversified crude supplies across the Middle East, Russia, the US and Africa, reducing dependence on any single producer. Price transmission, not volume: Any likely impact would come via global prices - and those are more sensitive to OPEC+ decisions and Middle East risks than Venezuelan politics.

The bigger picture: Energy geopolitics is hardening



(With inputs from agencies)

India is watching developments in Venezuela with a mix of caution and concern as geopolitical churn around the oil-rich nation raises questions about global supply, price volatility and long-term energy security.President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the United States would take temporary control of Venezuela and tap its vast oil reserves for sale to other countries. Trump said he was “designating people” from his cabinet to oversee Venezuela but offered no further details.In a separate and unexpected remark, Trump suggested US troops could be deployed, saying Washington is “not afraid of boots on the ground.”The United States’ capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has revived expectations that Venezuela’s oil sector could be “opened up” after years of isolation. The country holds the world’s largest proven crude reserves, yet produces only a fraction of what it once did.“Gaining control over Venezuelan crude oil lay at the core of the US operation. Venezuela holds about 18% of the world’s oil reserves, more than Saudi Arabia (around 16%), Russia (about 5–6%), or the United States (around 4%).Venezuela alone has more crude oil reserves than the US and Russia combined,” the GTRI said in its report.""We're going to have our very large United States oil companies... go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure,"" President Donald Trump said at a Mar-a-Lago news conference said.However, as per a Reuters report, Venezuela is unlikely to see a meaningful boost in crude output for years even if US oil majors invest billions of dollars. Political instability, sanctions uncertainty, decaying infrastructure and legal risks continue to deter large-scale capital inflows.As one analyst told Reuters, American firms “won’t return until they know for sure they will be paid and will have at least a minimal amount of security,” underlining why regime change does not automatically translate into higher barrels.Venezuela’s oil decline is structural, not cyclical.Output has collapsed over the past two decades following nationalisation, underinvestment and the hollowing out of state oil company PDVSA. Infrastructure across the Orinoco Belt is badly degraded, skilled manpower has fled, and supply chains for equipment and diluents remain broken.Thomas O’Donnell, an energy and geopolitical strategist, told Reuters that “if Trump et al can produce a peaceful transition with little resistance, then in five to seven years there is a significant oil-production ramp up as infrastructure is repaired and investments get sorted out.” He cautioned, however, that “there’s a lot that could go wrong.”Those risks include armed resistance, a prolonged political transition, and the perception of US dominance - factors that could delay investment decisions well beyond the current decade.At present, Chevron is the only American major operating in Venezuela, exporting roughly 150,000 barrels per day to the U.S. Gulf Coast under carefully calibrated sanctions waivers.Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said in December that he had spoken with the Trump administration about the importance of maintaining an American presence across political cycles. The company said it continues to operate “in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.”Francisco Monaldi of Rice University told Reuters that Chevron is best positioned to benefit from any opening, while other firms would wait for clarity on contracts and stability. He added that ConocoPhillips may be especially interested because it is owed more than $10 billion from past expropriations.Still, history offers little comfort. Ed Hirs of the University of Houston warned that previous US-backed regime changes in oil-rich states have not translated into tangible gains for American energy companies. “In those cases, the United States has received zero benefit from the oil,” he said, adding, “I’m afraid that history will repeat itself in Venezuela.”Despite Venezuela’s reserves, markets are not pricing in a near-term supply surge. Most of its current output flows to China and Cuba, while sanctions and logistics constrain exports.This matters for India because global crude prices - not Venezuelan barrels per se - are the key transmission channel. With no rapid increase in Venezuelan supply, there is little reason to expect a price shock that could alter India’s inflation or current account trajectory in the near term.An analysis by the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) argues that while control over crude oil is the strategic prize in Venezuela, India’s exposure is now minimal after years of sanctions-driven disengagement.According to the GTRI report, India’s crude imports from Venezuela collapsed by 81.3% in FY2025 to just $255.3 million, from $1.4 billion the previous year. Total imports from Venezuela stood at $364.5 million, while exports were a modest $95.3 million, led by pharmaceuticals .This is a far cry from the 2000s and early 2010s, when India was a major buyer of Venezuelan heavy crude and Indian firms such as ONGC Videsh held upstream stakes in the Orinoco Belt.US sanctions after 2019 forced India to sharply cut oil imports to avoid secondary penalties, effectively severing energy ties.Basically, there are three main factors that limit the impact on India’s economy and energy security:As GTRI notes, “given the low trade volumes, existing sanctions constraints, and the large geographical distance, the current developments in Venezuela are not expected to have any meaningful impact on India’s economy or energy security.”Still, Venezuela’s turmoil highlights a broader shift.GTRI argues that the episode reflects an emerging “might is right” global order, where access to raw materials and energy increasingly shapes geopolitics. With international institutions muted and most countries silent, resource-driven interventions may become more frequent.For India, the episode underscores the importance of strategic autonomy: securing energy and critical minerals without becoming hostage to great-power rivalries.","India is watching developments in Venezuela with a mix of caution and concern as geopolitical churn around the oil-rich nation raises questions about global supply, price volatility and long-term energy security.

‘Lot that could go wrong’: Trump plans to tap Venezuelan oil reserves — what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/lot-that-could-go-wrong-trump-plans-to-tap-venezuelan-oil-reserves-what-it-means/articleshow/126330498.cms,"'NO OIL, GOLD FOR US': Maduro’s Deputy Delcy Rodríguez TRASHES Trump’s Solution To Run Venezuela

Challenges for US

'Zero benefit'?

No quick win?

From OPEC heavyweight to marginal producer

After a dramatic capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by American forces, US President Donald Trump said that he wants to tap its oil infrastructure. The bigger question, however, is whether such a move would yield any quick results.According to analysts, even if US oil giants invest billions of dollars in Venezuela's massive oil reserves, they are unlikely to see a major rise in crude production anytime soon.The South American nation is home to world’s largest estimated oil reserves, yet years of decline have left its production at a fraction of former levels, Reuters reported. Output has steadily fallen due to poor management, underinvestment and the departure of foreign oil companies after Venezuela nationalised its energy sector in the 2000s. The process included the takeover of assets belonging to Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, prompting both firms to exit and pursue lengthy arbitration cases.Experts told Reuters that any company considering a return would face a long list of challenges. These include serious security concerns including decaying infrastructure, unresolved legal questions surrounding the US operation against Maduro, and the risk of prolonged political instability.Investors would also require clarity on sanctions and payment guarantees before committing capital. According to Mark Christian, director of business development at CHRIS Well Consulting, American firms won't return to Venezuela until they know for sure they will be paid and will have at least a minimal amount of security. He further told Reuters that US sanctions would need to be lifted before companies reconsider their presence. At the same time, Venezuela would also have to change its laws to allow greater participation by foreign oil producers.Although Venezuela nationalised its oil industry as early as the 1970s, tensions escalated in the 2000s when companies were forced into joint ventures controlled by state oil firm PDVSA. While some firms, including Chevron, negotiated arrangements to remain, others failed to reach agreements and took their disputes to international arbitration.“There is a lot that could go wrong,” said Thomas O’Donnell, an energy and geopolitical strategist. “If Trump et al can produce a peaceful transition with little resistance, then in five to seven years there is a significant oil-production ramp up as infrastructure is repaired and investments get sorted out.” He noted that Venezuela’s heavy crude is a good fit for US Gulf Coast refineries and can be blended with lighter shale oil.However, he cautioned that a transition seen as dominated by Washington could trigger resistance.“A botched political transition that has a feeling of US dominance can lead to years of resistance,” he said, referring to armed civilian and guerrilla groups operating in the country.At present, Chevron stands alone as the only US oil major still operating in Venezuela and is widely seen as best placed to benefit from any opening of the sector. Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University’s Baker Institute, said other American firms would likely wait on the sidelines, assessing political stability, contractual terms and the broader operating environment before making any move.ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil could have strong incentives to re-engage. ConocoPhillips is seeking more than $10 billion in compensation related to the takeover of three oil projects nearly 20 years ago.“The company that probably will be very interested in going back is Conoco, because they are owed more than $10 billion, and it's unlikely that they will get paid without going back into the country,” Monaldi said. Exxon, while owed a smaller sum, could also return under the right conditions.“ConocoPhillips is monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability. It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments,” a company spokesperson said in emailed comments to Reuters. Exxon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Chevron exports roughly 150,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan crude to the US Gulf Coast and has carefully navigated its relationship with the Trump administration to maintain operations.Chief executive Mike Wirth said in December that he had spoken with the administration about the importance of sustaining an American presence in Venezuela across political cycles. The company, which has operated in the country for more than a century, said it remains focused on employee safety and asset integrity. “We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,” a Chevron spokesperson said.OPEC and its allies are set to meet on Sunday and are expected to keep their current production policy unchanged. Although the group has been increasing output since last year, raising fears of a global supply glut, it has agreed to pause output hikes for January, February and March.Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston, said recent developments in Venezuela are unlikely to have any immediate effect on US oil and petrol prices, as much of the country’s crude is currently shipped to Cuba and China. He also drew parallels with previous US interventions in oil-rich nations.“Trump now joins the history of US presidents who have overthrown regimes of oil-rich countries. Bush with Iraq. Obama with Libya. In those cases, the United States has received zero benefit from the oil. I’m afraid that history will repeat itself in Venezuela,” Hirs said.While oil tankers chartered by Chevron have been among the few to leave Venezuelan ports in the past month, following Trump’s December announcement of a “blockade”, analysts say hopes of a quick win for US refiners remain uncertain.Any rapid restart of Venezuelan crude flows to the US Gulf Coast appears unlikely for now.Venezuela was once a major force in global oil markets. As a founding member of OPEC alongside Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, it produced up to 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1970s, accounting for more than 7% of global output.However, production slipped below 2 million bpd in the 2010s and averaged about 1.1 million bpd last year, just 1% of global supply.","Venezuela is home to the world's largest estimated oil reserves.

US President Donald Trump has said American oil companies will be allowed to move into Venezuela to tap its vast crude reserves following a US military operation that led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro.Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, Trump said major US energy firms would invest billions of dollars to repair Venezuela’s damaged oil infrastructure and restart production.“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” he said.Trump added that the United States would then sell “large amounts” of Venezuelan oil to other countries, according to AP.“We’re in the oil business. We’re going to sell it to them,” Trump said during the news conference. He added that oil companies will pay to rebuild Venezuela’s oil infrastructure.At the same time, he made it clear that US sanctions remain in place. “The embargo on all Venezuelan oil remains in full effect,” Trump said.Meanwhile, in a phone interview, President Donald Trump said the United States would ensure uninterrupted supply, dismissing concerns over China. Trump said he shared “very good relations” with Chinese President Xi Jinping and insisted there would be no problems with Beijing. “They will get the oil. We will let people have the oil,” he added.Venezuela has been under US oil sanctions since 2019 and currently produces about one million barrels of crude per day, much of which is sold on the black market at heavy discounts, as per AFP.Trump described Venezuela’s oil sector as a “total bust” for years despite holding the world’s largest proven crude reserves.He said the proposed US “partnership” would make Venezuelans “rich, independent and safe”, adding that Venezuelans living in the US would be “extremely happy” and “not going to suffer any more”, reported AFP.The president repeated similar remarks in a television interview, saying the US would be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry, without spelling out the details.Venezuela’s proven reserves are estimated at around 303 billion barrels, accounting for about 17 per cent of global reserves, as per The Hill.Trump’s comments came hours after Washington announced it had captured Maduro in an overnight military operation.Maduro and his wife were taken from a military base and flown out of the country aboard a US warship, with Trump saying they were headed to New York to face criminal charges.He also said the US planned to run Venezuela temporarily until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” of power could take place, reported AP.As part of a weeks-long military pressure campaign ahead of the raid, US forces seized at least two oil tankers that Washington said were operating in violation of sanctions.Trump also issued a warning to other political and military figures in Venezuela, saying “what happened to Maduro can happen to them,” according to AFP.He again accused Caracas of using oil revenues to finance “drug terrorism, human trafficking, murder and kidnapping”, allegations long denied by the Venezuelan government, as per AFP.Trump said he personally watched the military operation in real time and praised it as “extremely successful”, adding that US forces were prepared for further action if required.While US oil major Chevron already operates in Venezuela under limited sanctions waivers, Trump’s remarks signal a far deeper American role in the country’s energy sector once political control is restructured.

While most European Union goods are already subject to duties of at least 15%, pasta exports from Italy were initially set to attract an additional 92% levy, taking the total tariff rate to 107%. Under the revised proposal, the duties are now expected to fall within a range of 24% to 29%.The commerce department said the final tariff rates would be announced on March 12, following a review process detailed in a post-preliminary report released on Wednesday. The investigation was launched to examine claims that some Italian producers were selling pasta in the US market at unfairly low prices.A commerce department official told CNN that the reduction followed an “evaluation of additional comments received following a preliminary determination.”“Italian pasta makers have addressed many of commerce’s concerns raised in the preliminary determination, and reflects commerce’s commitment to a fair, transparent process,” the official added.The case involves 13 Italian pasta manufacturers and stems from an antidumping complaint filed in July by two US-based companies, 8th Avenue Food & Provisions and Winland Foods. The companies accused several Italian exporters of undercutting prices on pasta shipped to the United States.In preliminary findings issued in September, the commerce department said two firms, La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, sold pasta in the US “at less than normal value.” The report also described both companies as “uncooperative” during the probe, stating that the information they provided was “incomplete and unreliable.”The department noted that these two producers accounted for the largest share of Italian pasta exports to the US market. Neither company responded immediately to CNN’s request for comment.Italy’s ministry of foreign affairs welcomed the latest development, saying the revised tariff outlook reflected improved cooperation. “The redetermination of the tariffs is a sign of the recognition by US authorities of our companies’ willingness to cooperate,” the ministry said.","Italian pasta had been facing one of the highest tariff burdens among European food products entering the United States.

Zohran Mamdani is set to begin a new mayoral term after a historic election that gave him the highest vote count for a New York City mayor in 60 years.After winning with a campaign focused on working-class issues, he now faces the challenge of delivering on his promises as living costs remain at record highs, economic growth shows signs of slowing, federal support weakens and budget pressures mount.Housing remains the most severe strain on household finances. More than half of a typical family’s income goes towards rent, while about 100,000 people rely on homeless shelters each night, according to CNN. In Manhattan, median monthly rents have crossed $5,400. “This is what a full-blown affordability crisis looks like,” Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said in a December report.Central to Mamdani’s agenda is a pledge to freeze rents in rent-stabilised apartments, a policy he has described as his “landmark policy”. Nearly one million apartments, close to half of the city’s rental housing, would be affected. However, nonprofit housing providers and developers operating subsidised units say that existing revenues are already insufficient to meet operating costs.Simultaneously, the rising cost of daily necessities has pushed many residents into financial distress. Around 1.4 million people, roughly 15% of the city’s population, face food insecurity.Child care costs are also among the highest in the country, with a family required to earn $334,000 annually to afford care for a two-year-old, according to US Census Bureau data.Data from Community Preservation Corporation shows that since 2020, expenses for rent-stabilised housing have increased by 22%, while rents have risen by only about 11%. Industry experts warn that the gap between costs and income could lead to worsening building conditions as expenses for insurance, labour and utilities continue to rise.Alongside rent control, Mamdani has proposed the construction of 200,000 permanently subsidised affordable homes aimed at low- and moderate-income residents. Yet financial stress within the affordable housing sector is already evident. “The trends of increasing costs and reduced income are unsustainable for affordable housing,” Enterprise Community Partners and National Equity Fund said in a recent report, calling for emergency funding and state intervention to curb insurance expenses.Beyond housing, Mamdani has committed to free child care for children aged six weeks to five years and removing fares from city-run buses. Funding these initiatives depends on state approval to increase taxes on high-income residents and corporations. New York governor Kathy Hochul has publicly opposed making the entire bus network free, citing the potential $1 billion loss in fare revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Whether Mamdani can turn this proposal into policy will depend on political pressure from his support base, according to Columbia University historian Kim Phillips-Fein. His grassroots campaign has already inspired allies to launch a nonprofit organisation aimed at pressing city and state lawmakers in Albany. “People thought Mamdani’s election was impossible a year ago, but it was accomplished through significant political organizing,” Phillips-Fein said. His success as mayor “will depend upon an alignment of political forces and continued organizing.”Economic indicators present both strength and concern. While opponents warned before the election of a potential flight of wealthy residents or a repeat of the city’s 1970s fiscal collapse, Phillips-Fein told CNN that such comparisons are “shallow”. Unlike that period, New York is not experiencing population loss or a decline in manufacturing jobs.Employment and labour force participation remain at record levels, tax revenues are at historic highs and office leasing reached 97% of pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2025. However, momentum is slowing. The city is projected to add 78,000 fewer jobs in 2025 than the previous year, with most gains concentrated in the low-wage home health sector, according to Sarah Parker of the New York City Independent Budget Office.At the same time, a $6.5 billion budget shortfall is expected in 2027, with larger gaps forecast in subsequent years. The incoming administration is “facing a pretty challenging fiscal picture,” Parker said.Federal policy is likely to shape the city’s outlook. Mamdani has vowed to pursue “the most ambitious agenda to tackle the cost-of-living crisis this city has seen since the days of Fiorello La Guardia”, but unlike La Guardia’s era, current federal leadership has moved to cut key social programmes, CNN reported.State estimates suggest that Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill will lead to 1.5 million New Yorkers losing health insurance coverage, 300,000 households losing some or all SNAP benefits, $13 billion in cuts to the state’s healthcare system and 200,000 job losses, alongside higher long-term energy costs due to the cancellation of clean energy projects.Although Mamdani and US President Donald Trump held a meeting at the White House in November, the administration is withholding $18 billion in federal funding for New York City transit projects. Tariffs, immigration restrictions and reduced federal spending create a “challenging climate for cities like New York,” City Comptroller Brad Lander said in a December report, as cited by CNN. Meamwhile, Mamdani has maintained confidence that progress is possible. “I’m really looking forward to delivering for New Yorkers in partnership with the president on the affordability agenda.”","Zohran Mamdani is set to begin a new mayoral term after a historic election that gave him the highest vote count for a New York City mayor in 60 years.

Tesla has lost its position as the world’s largest electric vehicle maker after deliveries fell for a second consecutive year in 2025, weighed down by intensifying competition and weakening demand in key markets, AP reported.The US electric carmaker said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, a decline of 9 per cent from the previous year. Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million electric vehicles last year, has now overtaken Tesla as the world’s biggest EV manufacturer.Fourth-quarter deliveries stood at 418,227 vehicles, below the 440,000 units expected by analysts polled by FactSet. Sales in the quarter were also hit by the expiry of a $7,500 US federal tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.Tesla shares were largely unchanged in early trade on Friday at $450.27, as investors continued to look beyond near-term sales pressures. The stock ended 2025 up about 11 per cent, reflecting optimism around the company’s longer-term strategy.Despite declining vehicle sales, investors are betting on chief executive Elon Musk ’s push to reposition Tesla as a leader in autonomous mobility and robotics. Musk has repeatedly said that future growth will be driven by robotaxi services, energy storage and humanoid robots designed for use in homes and factories.The fourth quarter marked the first full period of sales for stripped-down, lower-priced versions of the Model Y and Model 3, unveiled in early October to revive demand. The new Model Y is priced just under $40,000, while the cheaper Model 3 starts below $37,000. These models are expected to help Tesla compete more aggressively with Chinese EV makers in Europe and Asia.Looking ahead, analysts expect pressure on financial performance to continue in the near term. For the fourth-quarter results due in late January, Tesla is forecast to report a 3 per cent drop in revenue and a nearly 40 per cent fall in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts, however, expect sales and profits to stabilise and begin recovering as 2026 progresses.Musk has argued that falling car sales are less critical to Tesla’s long-term outlook, as the company pivots towards new technologies and business lines. Supporting that vision, shareholders approved a potentially large new pay package for Musk at the company’s annual meeting in November.Musk, already the world’s richest individual, also received a boost last month when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed an earlier ruling that had voided a $55 billion pay package awarded to him by Tesla in 2018.","Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million electric vehicles last year, has now overtaken Tesla as the world’s biggest EV manufacturer. Tesla shares were largely unchanged in early trade on Friday at $450.27, as investors continued to look beyond near-term sales pressures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126309033,imgsize-682073,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

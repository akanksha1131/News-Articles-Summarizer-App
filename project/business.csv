Top stock market recommendations : According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, DLF, SRF, and Adani Ports are the top buy calls for today. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for March 13, 2025:Nifty recovered nearly 150 points from its intraday lows of Wednesday which was purely due to a weaker global handover to end flat. The index has been holding above its recent resistance of 22450 for the past couple of days as the market awaits a short covering trigger. Charts have opened up for a journey towards 22800+ for this week awaited by a positive sentiment trigger to lift the index higher. On the downside, 22250 is likely to act as a fresh demand generator for the index.Bank Nifty on the flip side has ended at a 9 month low earlier this week due to pressure on smaller private banking space. Any price action allowing the index to sustain below 47800 could further trigger a bearish cup and handle breakdown on charts of Bank Nifty. Negation for the same stands at 48100 while a short covering move does not trigger unless a close above 49000 is not seen on the index.DLF has completed a 35% correction from its highs, a similar percentage of cooldown was seen in 2021-2022 correction in this REALTY bull market started since Covid lows. A reversal has been confirmed on weekly charts with an initial spike of 6-8% on the upside.SRF has registered its highest ever weekly closing as chemicals have started showing signs of ending its multiyear consolidation. Stock is continuing its momentum given the ongoing flag breakout on charts and can extend this by another 5-7% from CMP.A 3 month trendline breakout has been seen on charts of ADANIPORTS, this is in synchronisation with a reversal from a 50% retracement zone on charts near 1000 where the chart has formed a triple bottom. A retest of 200 DMA upside is now open towards 1200+","Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, DLF, SRF, and Adani Ports are the top buy calls for today.

Golden Visa Benefits:

In today's uncertain and dynamic global environment, affluent individuals seek alternative arrangements for themselves and their loved ones - arrangements that provide secure havens during turbulent times whilst enabling enhanced access to worldwide commercial and lifestyle prospects.

Golden visas serve as strategic tools for affluent individuals seeking to safeguard their wealth and enhance their global mobility. These programmes are said to offer a reliable safeguard against economic and political uncertainties in an unstable global environment.

The golden visa scheme enables high net worth persons to establish residence in financially advantageous jurisdictions whilst securing comprehensive residential rights, including access to employment, educational institutions and healthcare facilities in the host country.

Some Available Golden Visa Programmes for Indians

According to an ET report, despite tightening regulations, Indian applicants can still access several golden visa schemes:

Portugal continues to offer residency through investments in qualified funds, scientific research initiatives, or business expansion projects.

Greece has adjusted its programme, raising the real estate investment threshold to €400,000, whilst offering a €250,000 alternative route through local startup investments.

Spain's scheme remains accessible to investors who submitted applications prior to 2024, despite plans to discontinue the programme.

Malta maintains its citizenship by investment option, subject to thorough background checks.

Various Caribbean nations, including St. Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and Saint Lucia, provide passports for investments beginning at $200,000.

The UAE golden visa programme continues to welcome Indian investors and professionals from essential sectors, including healthcare, technology, and business.

Singapore's Global Investor Program, whilst not technically a golden visa, enables permanent residency through substantial local business investments.

Golden visa programmes: Countries around the world are strengthening restrictions on unauthorised immigration, whilst maintaining pathways for investment-based residency. Investment visa schemes provide opportunities to obtain residential status or nationality through monetary commitments. Although traditionally popular amongst Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern investors, these programmes now draw applicants from across the globe.Golden visas allow for investment-linked residency on a temporary or permanent basis. These are linked to applicants making qualifying financial contributions, including property acquisition, enterprise establishment or state fund deposits. The flexible residency requirements of certain programmes appeal to those seeking alternative options whilst retaining freedom of movement.A golden visa programme is a legal pathway where qualified individuals receive residential privileges in a country by making specified financial investments. This differs from citizenship-by-investment schemes, which provide complete citizenship benefits. Through golden visas, wealthy individuals can obtain legal residency status, allowing them to live, pursue employment, education and access healthcare services in their chosen nation.Nations increasingly provide residence and citizenship through investment schemes such as golden visa programmes, featuring diverse investment choices tailored to individual family needs.Golden passports provide ""citizenship by investment”. They deliver comprehensive citizenship privileges, frequently including admission to regional economic zones. Within the European Union, Malta's scheme enables investors to live, work and pursue education across all EU member states. In the Caribbean region, nations including St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Grenada provide competitive options beginning at approximately $200,000.US President Donald Trump has introduced the ""gold card"" scheme as a replacement for the existing EB-5 visa system. This initiative would grant residency rights and citizenship prospects in exchange for a $5 million investment. Unlike the current EB-5 programme, the proposed scheme suggests direct payment to the US government to address national debt. This arrangement could present an alternative solution for Indian investors facing extensive waiting periods in the current employment-based green card system.",Golden visas allow for investment-linked residency on a temporary or permanent basis.

"Some relief! Average cost of preparing vegetarian thali at home goes down in February, but chicken plays spoilsport for non-vegetarians",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/some-relief-average-cost-of-preparing-vegetarian-thali-at-home-goes-down-in-february-but-chicken-plays-spoilsport-for-non-vegetarians/articleshow/118834280.cms,"Vegetarian thali cost saw a 1% reduction year-on-year in February.

In February, the vegetarian thali saw a reduction in cost compared to the previous year, whilst the non-vegetarian thali showed an increase due to higher broiler prices.

The vegetarian thali saw a 1% reduction year-on-year in February, whereas the non-vegetarian thali registered an increase of approximately 6%:

The reduction in vegetarian thali cost was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder

was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder Tomato prices reduced to Rs 23/kg from Rs 32/kg, showing a 28% decrease year-on-year, due to 20% increased supply

LPG costs decreased by 11% year-on-year (to Rs 803 per 14.2 kg cylinder in Delhi from Rs 903) providing additional savings

The decline would have been more substantial if not for the increased prices of onion (11%), potato (16%) and vegetable oil (18%) year-on-year, says CRISIL.

In some relief for the common man, the cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali declined year-on-year in February, according to CRISIL’s latest monthly indicator of food plate cost, RRR (Roti Rice Rate). The cost of a non-vegetarian thali, however grew approximately 6% due to rise in broiler (chicken) prices, the report said. On a month-on-month basis the cost of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian thalis came down.The calculation of an average thali's preparation cost at home by CRISIL considers input prices across different regions of India. Monthly variations indicate the impact on everyday household expenses. The analysis tracks price movements of essential ingredients including cereals, pulses, broilers, vegetables, spices, edible oil and cooking gas.The rise in non-vegetarian thali prices was primarily due to a 15% year-on-year increase in broiler (chicken) prices. Broiler (chicken), which constitutes approximately 50% of a non-vegetarian thali's cost, saw this increase due to previous year's low baseline when prices had fallen because of oversupply.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know Additionally, higher feed expenses, resulting from a 6% year-on-year increase in maize prices, contributed to the overall cost surge.During the month, both vegetarian and nonvegetarian thali costs decreased by 5% compared to the previous month. This reduction was attributed to fresh supplies causing price drops in onion (7%), potato (17%), and tomato (25%). Additionally, broiler (chicken) prices fell by an estimated 5% month-on-month due to reduced demand following bird flu concerns in southern India.","In February, the vegetarian thali saw a reduction in cost compared to the previous year.

Fruits Inflation Hits 10-Yr High



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





NEW DELHI: Retail inflation cooled to a seven-month low in Feb as food prices eased, providing headroom for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to lower interest rates in April, while industrial output growth improved in Jan, led by expansion in manufacturing.Data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Wednesday showed inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 3.6% in Feb, slower than the 4.3% in Jan and below the 5.1% recorded in Feb last year. There is a decline of 65 basis points in headline inflation in Feb compared to Jan and it is the lowest year-on-year inflation after July. The Feb number is below 4% — the lower band of RBI’s tolerance level.The food price index slowed to 3.8% in Feb, lower than the nearly 6% in Jan and 8.7% in Feb 2024. Rural inflation cooled to 3.8% in Feb from 4.6% in Jan, while urban inflation also slowed to 3.3% during the month from 3.9% in Jan.The inflation rate in vegetables, pulses and products, eggs and spices contracted in Feb. Inflation in oils and fats rose 16.4% — a 34-month high — during the month, while in fruits, it was at 14.8% — a 10-year high. Vegetables inflation has slid into the negative zone after 20 months and according to SBI Research among vegetables, the 80% of month-on-month decline is attributed to three vegetables only (garlic, potato, tomato).Experts expect the central bank to cut rates further to help boost growth against the backdrop of easing price pressures. “The Feb CPI inflation print falling well below 4% has cemented the expectation of a back-to-back 25 basis points rate cut in the April 2025 MPC meeting. This may be followed by another 25 bps repo rate cut either in the June 2025 or the Aug 2025 meetings, dependent in large part on the next GDP growth print for Q4 FY2025,” said Aditi Nayar , chief economist at ratings agency Icra.Separate data showed the index of industrial production (IIP) rose 5% in Jan, faster than the upwardly revised 3.5% in Dec. The manufacturing sector grew by 5.5% in Jan, higher than the 3.6% recorded in the same month last year and above the 3.4% in Dec.","Retail inflation cooled to a seven-month low in Feb as food prices eased.

From challenger to ally



‘Telcos’ Starlink deals can plug dark spots’

Voda idea next in line?



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





NEW DELHI: A day after Airtel announced a deal to market the satellite internet services of Elon Musk’s Starlink in India and supplement its network coverage, Mukesh Ambani ’s Reliance Jio too joined the bandwagon, coming out with a twin deal, making it a strong entry ecosystem for the American satellite company.But it will take a while for Starlink to offer services as the company awaits a licence, which will be followed by spectrum and the creation of required ground infrastructure for the services, which are seen to be highly expensive when compared to what current telecom operators charge in India.Sources said the rapprochement between the domestic telecom majors and Starlink may have come after a nudge from the Indian and US govts. The partnerships come less than a month after Musk met Modi in Washington.The two deals within a span of a few hours have cashreated a buzz around Voda Idea also announcing a similar arrangement with SpaceX.After years of waiting, a global mobile personal communication by satellite (GMPCS) services licence has been pending with the department of telecom and ministry of home affairs. “Once it gets GMPCS, Starlink will need to receive certain other approvals and also one from the department of space before it formally begins taking orders and works towards launching operations. It also needs to set up landing stations in India, and needs to assure the govt on non-transfer of data of Indians during its operations and adherence to ‘requests’ from law enforcement agencies,” the source said.Starlink has long been pushing bureaucracy for its satcom licence but has so far remained unsuccessful, with security establishments raising a few red flags and seeking clarifications.Officials are certainly bullish about the development. A senior govt official said having satellite communications blend with the current terrestrial networks of Airtel and Jio would mean “effectively plugging the dark spots” in rural India, difficult terrains, and even in congested metros. “Even the Universal Service Obligation Fund, created through a levy on telecom players, has not been able to close this gap and we are hoping that an agreement such as this will help achieve 100% coverage across the country.”The official further added: “Importantly, a new operator and a new communications medium — satellite in this case — enters India, giving more options to the consumer and driving new competition in the market. Remember, we have progressed from landlines, to mobile phones, to data-led conversation through WhatsApp and FaceTime. Soon, it will be enabled through satellites. This will also see new investments by new satellite players and also help further the maturing of the telecom ecosystem.”However, there are still technological challenges. “Most of the regular mobile phones being used by the public do not have provision to get satellite connectivity. So, the integration on regular calls will not be seamless as the handover between terrestrial and satellite networks will not be available automatically until telecom companies and phone manufacturers work out solutions. So far, a customer — on a few select expensive devices — has the option to choose satellite communications manually.”Regarding home broadband, the satellite services will be very expensive compared to the current fibre-based solutions that are priced lower than one-tenth of satcom. Also, the speed through home fibre is much more than what a satcom provider gives. “The biggest use in the beginning will be in enterprise areas such as mining, oil rigs, airlines, and shipping. Also, satcom will help provide internet connectivity in difficult terrains such as jungles, wildlife safaris, and rural areas, where mobile services have not percolated effectively,” an official said.Bharti group chief Sunil Mittal said there is a need for terrestrial operators to join forces with satcom players. “In my opening remark at the recently concluded Mobile World Congress 2025 in Barcelona, I made a call to both telecom and satellite players to work together, combine their strengths, and complete the mission of connecting the unconnected, covering the oceans and the skies as well as difficult-to-reach areas. I am glad that this is being followed through with active announcements of partnerships between satellite companies and telecom operators… Soon customers will be able to carry their mobiles to the remotest part of the world, with them in the skies and blue oceans.”Welcoming Starlink to India, communications minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, “It will be useful for remote area railway projects.”","Airtel announced a deal to market the satellite internet services of Elon Musk’s Starlink in India.

NEW DELHI: Singapore’s sovereign private equity giant Temasek is acquiring 9-10% stake in Haldiram Snacks Foods for over Rs 8,500 crore, valuing the company at around $10 billion. Haldiram Snacks Foods is the parent entity of Haldiram’s, widely recognised as the country’s largest snacks brand.The acquisition marks one of the largest recent deals in India’s fast-moving consumer goods sector, potentially signalling more foreign investment ahead. The agreement, which was signed March 11, comes after months of negotiations, with Temasek emerging as the highest bidder for the minority stake. The investment underscores Temasek’s strategic focus on strengthening its presence in India’s rapidly expanding consumer sector, sources said.While Temasek clinched the deal for minority stake, discussions with other PE biggies Blackstone and Alpha Wave Global, are reportedly underway for an additional 5% stake that the promoter family is considering to sell, sources added.With a reported $37 billion exposure to India as of March 2024 and plans to invest an additional $10 billion over the next three years, Temasek is diversifying beyond its high-profile stakes in Manipal Health (where it owns 51% after a $2 billion investment) and Rebel Foods (where it led a $210 million round in 2024, valuing it at $1.4 billion).","Singapore’s sovereign private equity giant Temasek is acquiring 9-10% stake in Haldiram Snacks Foods for over Rs 8,500 crore, valuing the company at around $10 billion.

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





BENGALURU: The future of energy will be a decentralised structure, with millions of small producers buying and selling power in a way that mirrors Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani said at an event hosted by Arkam Ventures in Bengaluru on Wednesday.""The next UPI is energy,"" said Nilekani, who played a pivotal role in developing India's digital public infrastructure (DPI), which delivered successful digital initiatives like UPI and Aadhaar. He emphasised that the coming era would see households not just consuming electricity but also producing and trading it. “Every home will be an energy producer because they have rooftop solar , an energy storer because they have an EV battery, and a producer, seller, and buyer of energy,” he said. “These trades may not be with the grid; they may be with your neighbour.”The concept aligns with efforts like the Unified Energy Interface (UEI), an open network launched last year by 20 energy companies to streamline EV charging. Nilekani drew parallels to historical energy consumption patterns, noting that people long purchased energy in small, incremental amounts – whether as firewood, coal, or LPG cylinders. “But electricity always was something we received from the grid, or generated privately using oil-powered generators,” he said.With rooftop solar and EV batteries becoming widespread, he believes energy transactions will shift to a seamless, peer-to-peer marketplace, much like digital payments. “You're going to create millions of energy entrepreneurs who will invest in producing small amounts of energy and selling it to each other,” he said. This, he added, could fundamentally reshape the energy landscape, creating a more distributed and resilient system.However, realising this vision will require regulatory reforms. “We need to dramatically simplify our laws,” Nilekani said, pointing to outdated regulations and compliance burdens that hinder energy innovation. He cited India’s new Income Tax Act as an example of how laws can be rewritten for clarity and efficiency.Additionally, he stressed the need for a broader shift towards formalisation, including portable credentials and benefits for workers, which would help entrepreneurs operate more freely. “If we reduce the friction for small businesses, millions of new opportunities will emerge,” he said.This shift, Nilekani argued, could unlock a massive transformation in India's energy sector. “The whole energy sector is going to be a huge thing. “This is a huge unlock,” he said.","Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani said the future of energy will be a decentralised structure.

BENGALURU: Flipkart cofounder Binny Bansal launched a new startup, Opptra, which specialises in developing franchise business portfolios. Opptra will license and sell branded consumer goods online, combining market expertise, digital-first brand building, and a centralised supply chain to accelerate market entry.“Many consumer brands have the potential to scale globally, but navigating new markets is tough—cultural, infrastructural, and regulatory differences make it complex, especially in a rapidly evolving retail landscape. Opptra unlocks Asia for brands by combining deep market expertise, cutting-edge tech, and a powerful supply chain. But Asia is just the start—our longer-term vision is to take brands from anywhere to everywhere around the world,” said Bansal.Opptra’s model differs from traditional distribution networks by focusing on AI-driven localisation, data analytics, and ecommerce expertise. Instead of relying solely on brick-and-mortar expansion, Opptra will balance online and offline channels to cater to local consumer behaviour. The company is also developing a global supply chain integrating robotics, automation, and smart logistics – an approach shaped by Bansal’s experience at Flipkart.Each franchise operation will partner with brands through master franchise agreements or licensing deals. Rather than following traditional distribution models focused on physical stores, they will utilise their online retail presence to enable swift market penetration. With Asia generating 70% of worldwide consumer expansion and the surge in online shopping reducing market entry obstacles across the region, brands can benefit from lower setup expenses and enhanced customer access.","Flipkart cofounder Binny Bansal launched a new startup, Opptra, which specialises in developing franchise business portfolios.

MUMBAI: Retail investors continued to invest through the mutual fund route in Feb despite a volatile market. However, they made some changes to their investment pattern, top MF executives and analysts said after industry body Amfi on Wednesday released the data for Feb.Monthly gross inflows through the SIP route, that over the last few years have emerged as the preferred mode of investing for retail investors, dipped to Rs 25,999 crore in Feb from Rs 26,400 crore in Jan.Amfi chief Venkat Chalasani pointed out that Feb usually records a dip in gross SIP flows. On an annual basis, monthly SIP flows , however, showed a nearly 36% jump from Rs 19,187 crore in Feb 2024. The latest data also showed that equity inflows dipped 26% on the month, although it was the 48th consecutive month of net inflows.Despite net positive flows through equity funds , thanks to the bad market conditions in Feb, fund industry’s total assets under management (AUM) fell 4% to about Rs 64.5 lakh crore from Rs 67.3 lakh crore in the previous month. “The decline in the overall AUM from Jan to Feb was primarily due to mark-to-market losses in equity funds,” Chalasani said.Debt funds showed a net outflow of about Rs 6,500 crore that industry analysts said was mostly due to corporate activities, especially withdrawals by treasuries of large companies. Top industry players pointed out that with the stock market showing heightened volatility with a negative bias, retail investors have been shifting their investment choices from small & midcap funds to flexicap funds . Thematic and sectoral funds still remain one of the favourites among investors, they said.In Feb, small cap schemes net took in Rs 3,722 crore, compared to Rs 5,721 crore in Jan, a 35% drop. Similarly, the corresponding figures for midcap schemes were Rs 3,407 crore and Rs 5,148 crore, a 34% decline. In contrast, flexicap funds net took in Rs 5,104 crore in Feb, compared to Rs 5,698 crore in Jan, a drop of nearly 12%.The data also showed that gold ETFs continued to attract strong inflows, though the pace had slowed on a monthly basis but jumped on an annual basis. Compared to a net inflow of Rs 3,751 crore in Jan, the Feb figure was at Rs 1,980 crore. The number for Feb 2024 was Rs 997 crore.","Retail investors continued to invest through the mutual fund route in Feb despite a volatile market.

NEW DELHI: Aviation industry personnel in India have made a beeline for joining Saudi Arabia’s soon to be launched second national carrier Riyadh Air , that is owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia.The airline website’s career portal has been open for two years on which pilots, cabin crew members, ground, maintenance staff and others can evince interest by submitting their details.“In the last two years, we have received 14 lakh applications from 146 nationalities of which 52% are women. India is one of the biggest source countries for the applications. We are overwhelmed by the interest and faith in our brand, despite the fact that so far we have not announced any salary structures,” Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas said here.The upcoming full service airline has ordered up to 132 aircraft, Airbus A321neos and Boeing 787 Dreamliners. It is currently in talks with both Boeing and Airbus for placing orders for ultra long range wide bodies with the choice being between the B777 9X and A350-1000. It currently has one aircraft and 500 employees, including 36 cabin crew and pilots each. “After Saudis, the second biggest nationality of employees is Indians. Ditto for the population of Singapore,” he said. A large number of Indian professionals work in Middle East carriers like Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways.The airline, which is going to start operations in a few months, says India is a key market for it. “In 2024 Saudi Arabia saw 15 lakh tourists from India which was a 50% jump over previous year. 93% of flyers at Riyadh are point to point and just 7% are in transit. That shows the scope of growth from India as well as of our connecting potential from our hub, Riyadh, as our fleet grows. Nearby Doha has 80% transfer traffic and the figures for Dubai are also very high,” Douglas said.","The airline website’s career portal has been open for two years on which pilots, cabin crew members, ground, maintenance staff and others can evince interest.

Looks to double India bet to $100 billion



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





MUMBAI: Blackstone chairman & CEO Stephen Schwarzman said that the new tariff regime in the US has the potential to boost growth and increase American consumption demand.“I think it is too early to tell because you don’t know how this is all going to work out. I think it will result in a significant increase in manufacturing activity in the US, which should increase US growth rates. If that happens, given the size of the US economy, it would likely benefit the world. A faster-growing US can drive higher consumption, but this is just one possible scenario,” said Schwarzman.“What the US is trying to achieve is to have a code on tariffs with each major country; that way, the balance of trade will be determined by how good and cheap your product is. The theory is there shouldn’t be anything standing in the way of that sort of decision, making it easy for a customer to make a choice” said Schwarzman who is visiting India.According to Schwarzman, India is “quite well placed” in tariff talks. “Very few countries in the world have had that treatment, and India has already made some changes. I anticipate that negotiations should go relatively well. There are countries with much bigger differentials, and there’ll be a lot more news about them than about India. That’s a good place to be.” He added that the concern in India appeared to be arising because of the uncertainty.Schwarzman, who chaired the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum during Trump’s first term, said PM Modi had a “very good” meeting with the US President, where they agreed to a trade deal.Blackstone, with over $1 trillion in assets globally, aims to double its India exposure to $100 billion. It is India’s largest foreign company, real estate owner, and private equity firm.Schwarzman said India needs more infrastructure investment and better project completion. Coordination between the central and state govts remains a challenge, as foreign investors find the approval process complex. A more transparent tax code would also help, as investors sometimes face unexpected issues.Schwarzman, who last visited India just before the pandemic, said the country has always been a market of “tremendous opportunity.” The firm plans to expand into credit and infrastructure, both key global business areas. “India is the fastest-growing major economy in the world. While challenges exist, they are manageable compared to those in other markets. Unlike some fast-growing economies, India doesn’t face severe debt or real estate crises, making its growth more sustainable. Despite market fluctuations and political issues, the long-term trajectory remains positive,” he said.Schwarzman remained optimistic about India’s economic growth despite market correction. “ Some believed the market was overvalued, and a correction was expected. When that happens, people get nervous. Growth rates have been among the highest globally, and I don’t see anything that will change that in the near to intermediate term.”","Schwarzman said the new tariff regime in the US has the potential to boost growth and increase American consumption demand.

"E-cigarettes, lighters, power banks, knives: What’s the most-seized check-in bag item at Bengaluru airport?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/kia-haul-1412kg-of-power-banks-1132-of-lighters-e-cigars/articleshow/118901667.cms,"BENGALURU: With mobile phones becoming an extension of one's body self, the need to keep them working by overcoming their battery limitations, is most people's headache. More so, air travellers prefer to be equipped with the power bank on the go. However, the flyers seem to be unaware of the fact that power banks in check-in bags is resented by airport security personnel who confiscate them.According to the security data from Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), 1,412 kg of power banks were seized from flyers' check-in bags between Jan last year and Feb this year. The other two major goods confiscated were 556kg of lighters and 576kg e-cigarettes.Power banks are allowed in cabin baggages. The primary reason for power banks to be prohibited in check-in bags is their components— lithium ion batteries, which are dangerous and when overheated can cause fire and explosions.According to Dangerous Goods Regulations, one can carry portable electronic devices (PED) containing lithium metal or lithium ion cells or batteries in cabin baggage and each person can carry only 15 PEDs. In case of lithium ion batteries, portable devices can't be of more than 100Wh-hour capacity. However, there are special power banks which are over 160 Wh and they can be carried on special permission from the airline.""Damaged and modified power banks will not pass security check because of their flammable nature. Ideal power banks that are damaged or have a swelling might burst in mid air, risking the lives of passengers,"" said an official.The other restricted items intercepted by security personnel included flammable liquids, gases, and dried coconut (copra), all of which pose safety risks.""Once seized, restricted items are systematically categorised based on their classification and stored in a secure location for up to 15 days. This holding period allows passengers, in certain cases, to claim items that may be permitted in checked baggage. However, unclaimed or hazardous items are handed over to a BBMP-authorised vendor for environmentally responsible disposal, ensuring compliance with safety regulations,"" said a BIAL spokesperson.Despite the high volume of confiscations, officials note that screening trends remained consistent over the past year. There was no significant increase in new or unusual items, indicating that passengers continue to carry commonly restricted goods rather than emerging threats.However, one notable regional pattern emerged regarding e-cigarettes. While many countries permit passengers to carry e-cigarettes in their carry-on luggage, India strictly prohibits them, leading to frequent confiscations—particularly from international passengers transiting to domestic flights.""In India, e-cigarettes and vapes are strictly prohibited in the country and these are the ones that are being seized in large numbers here. There are constant arguments between passengers and security personnel about vapes and e-cigarettes being allowed in other countries, but we have prohibitory orders,"" said an airport official.","1,412 kg of power banks were seized from flyers' check-in bags between Jan last year and Feb this year.

When Donald Trump was sworn in as the United States President on January 20, he was surrounded by some of the globe's most affluent individuals. The billionaires in attendance - including Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg - were at their peak wealth, benefiting from robust stock market performance.However, after seven weeks, circumstances have shifted dramatically. The commencement of Trump's second term has resulted in significant financial setbacks for five billionaires who were present at the Capitol Rotunda, with their combined wealth declining by $209 billion, as reported by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The interval between Trump's election and inauguration proved profitable for the world's wealthiest individuals, with the S&P 500 Index reaching numerous record highs. Investors were drawn to equity and crypto markets, anticipating business-friendly policies under Trump.Musk's Tesla Inc. experienced a 98% increase post-election, achieving a record high. Arnault's LVMH rose 7% in the week preceding Inauguration Day, increasing the French businessman's wealth by $12 billion. Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc., despite banning Trump in 2021, gained 9% before the new term and an additional 20% during his first four weeks in office.However, expectations of continued market growth under Trump's new term have been disrupted. The S&P 500 has decreased by 6.4% since his inauguration, with government employee redundancies and uncertainty regarding tariffs affecting equities, leading to a 2.7% decline on Monday.The corporations associated with the inauguration attendees have experienced substantial losses, with their combined market value dropping by $1.39 trillion since January 17, the final trading day before the inauguration. Here's an examination of these fortunes:Tesla CEO Elon Musk, 53, saw his net worth reach a record $486 billion on Dec. 17, the highest ever recorded on Bloomberg's wealth index. His wealth surge was largely driven by Tesla’s stock, which nearly doubled post-election. However, Tesla has since lost all those gains, with European consumers turning away due to Musk’s political affiliations. In Germany, Tesla sales plunged over 70% in early 2024, while Chinese shipments fell 49% last month—the lowest since July 2022.Bezos, 61, who earlier clashed with Trump over the postal service and his ownership of the Washington Post during the president's first term, congratulated Trump the day after the election on Musk's X. Not only this, Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund in December, and Bezos dined with the president last month, the same day that Bezos announced that his newspaper will prioritize personal liberties and free markets in its opinion section. Amazon shares have fallen 14% since Jan. 17.Brin, aged 51, a co-founder of the original Google alongside Larry Page, maintains a 6% ownership stake. He participated in demonstrations at San Francisco airport in 2017, opposing the Trump administration's immigration measures. Following Trump's re-election in November, Brin attended a dinner with him at Mar-a-Lago in the subsequent month. In early February, Alphabet Inc. experienced a significant share price decline of over 7% after failing to meet quarterly revenue projections. Recently, Alphabet's representatives, whilst facing pressure from the Justice Department regarding the potential break-up of its search engine operations, engaged in discussions with government officials, requesting a more moderate approach.Meta emerged as the top performer among the Magnificent Seven technology companies in early 2024.

Will Trump's tariff impact Indian economy?

Donald Trump's 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports go into effect on Wednesday with US President asserting that these taxes would generate US factory employment during a period when his fluctuating tariff policies are unsettling the stock market and raising economic decline concerns.Trump eliminated all exceptions from his 2018 metal tariffs, whilst also increasing aluminium tariffs from 10%. These actions, stemming from a February directive, form part of a comprehensive strategy to alter international trade. The US president has implemented separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with intentions to levy ""reciprocal"" rates on imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea beginning April 2, AP news agency reported.During Tuesday's Business Roundtable meeting with CEOs, Trump stated that the tariffs were encouraging companies to invest in US factories. Despite an 8% decline in the S&P 500 stock index over the previous month due to growth concerns, Trump maintained that increased tariff rates would be more effective in restoring factory operations.""The higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build,"" Trump told the group. ""The biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That's a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.""On Tuesday, Trump considered imposing 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium but maintained the 25% rate after Ontario cancelled plans to implement an electricity surcharge for Michigan, Minnesota and New York.Moody's has issued a warning over the challenges that Indian steel manufacturers, who are currently experiencing difficulties with reduced prices and declining profits due to substantial steel imports into the country over the past 12 years, will face.""The US tariffs on steel will increase competition and exacerbate oversupply at other steel producing markets. Indian steel producers will face increased challenges in exporting their products,"" stated Hui Ting Sim, assistant vice president at Moody's Ratings.According to data from the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), US imports of steel and aluminium have shown an upward trend despite the trade war beginning in 2018. Primary steel imports reached $33 billion in 2024, showing an increase from $31.1 billion in 2018.Canada ($7.7 billion), Brazil ($5 billion), and Mexico ($3.3 billion) emerged as the primary suppliers during this period. In contrast, imports from China and India remained considerably lower at $550 million and $450 million respectively.GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava observed Trump's latest tariff strategy as predictable. ""If Trump follows the same playbook, the return of tariffs on steel and aluminium could be used as leverage in trade negotiations. The 2018 tariffs were widely seen as an aggressive strategy to force trading partners into concessions. The latest move, if implemented, could lead to new trade disputes and retaliatory measures from affected countries,"" he told PTI.The initiative is expected to advantage US domestic steel manufacturers, providing them access to a market with robust steel demand, enabling them to increase their selling prices.The recent announcement of 25% tariff on steel and aluminium has caused global concern, yet its effect on India's US exports is expected to be minimal.India's iron and steel exports in the previous financial year reached $475 million, whilst iron and steel products amounted to $2.8 billion. The export value of aluminium and related products stood at approximately $950 million in 2023-24. According to government and American Iron and Steel Institute statistics, the US primarily imports steel from Brazil, Canada and Mexico, with South Korea and Vietnam following as significant suppliers.The earlier implementation of tariffs by the Trump administration in 2018 included a 25% levy on steel and 10% on aluminium, justified on national security grounds. These measures encompassed most primary steel products, excluding stainless steel but including steel pipes and tubes. The widespread application of these tariffs to most nations led to reciprocal actions, heightening international trade tensions and forcing American automobile manufacturers to reduce their output.","US President Donald Trump's 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports go into effect on Wednesday.

Wall Street ended lower on Tuesday, extending a turbulent period of losses as uncertainty over US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies continued to shake investor confidence.Trump said late in the afternoon that he would “probably” reconsider doubling planned tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, just hours after announcing a sharp hike. The back-and-forth on tariff measures against some of the United States’ closest trading partners has rattled markets, compounding fears of an economic slowdown.“The volatility is nothing new to us over the course of the last three weeks,” said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management. He noted that market swings have been “largely driven by the uncertainty around things like tariffs.” However, he also pointed out that Tuesday marked a potential shift, saying, “For the first time in three weeks, it appears as though we might be getting a little bit of good news… there might be a window cracked open in the negotiations with Canada on tariffs.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1%, closing at 41,433.48. The S&P 500 slid 0.8% to 5,572.07, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.2% to 17,436.10. The downturn followed Monday’s significant plunge, which saw the Nasdaq suffer its worst single-day loss since 2022.Since taking office, Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, though he has at times walked back some levies on key trading partners.“Certainly, the longer this uncertainty persists, the more investors are willing to take money off the table and de-risk their portfolios,” Hogan added.Despite the general market decline, the Nasdaq found some support from major tech stocks. Tesla rebounded 3.8% following Trump’s announcement that he would purchase one of the company’s vehicles, while AI chipmaker Nvidia climbed 1.7% after suffering steep losses on Monday.Tuesday’s losses deepened fears that Wall Street could be heading into a correction phase. At one point during the session, the S&P 500 briefly fell more than 10% below its record high from last month, a level that professional investors define as a correction.The S&P 500 ultimately fell 0.8% but fluctuated throughout the day, at one stage dropping as much as 1.5%. The Dow lost 478 points, while the Nasdaq hovered in and out of positive territory before ending with a 0.2% loss.(With inputs from agencies)","The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1%, closing at 41,433.48.

US stock markets tumbled further on Tuesday after President Donald Trump intensified his trade war by announcing a sharp increase in tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, doubling the planned hike to 50%. The move sent Wall Street reeling, with the S&P 500 falling 1.1% in afternoon trading, pushing it nearly 10% below its all-time high set just weeks ago.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 625 points, or 1.5%, by 1 p.m. Eastern time, extending a brutal stretch of volatility. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dipped a more modest 0.7%, as Tesla and a few Big Tech stocks managed to limit some of the broader market’s losses, according to news agency AP.The S&P 500 experienced another sharp intraday swing, flipping from a modest morning gain to a steep 1.2% decline—a pattern that has repeated throughout the past two weeks. This latest bout of wild market fluctuations reflects investors’ growing uncertainty over how much economic pain Trump is willing to inflict through tariffs in his bid to reshape global trade.While announcing the tariff increase, Trump made an eyebrow-raising statement, saying, “The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty-First State. This would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.”His remark added to the market’s unease, as businesses and investors struggled to gauge whether further trade restrictions could follow.Beyond the immediate market selloff, Trump’s on-and-off approach to tariffs is beginning to take a toll on consumer and business confidence.Delta Air Lines, for instance, warned that customer uncertainty is already impacting demand, leading the airline to slash its revenue growth forecast for the first quarter of 2025 from 7%-9% down to 3%-4%. Delta's stock plummeted 8.5% in response.Similarly, Southwest Airlines lowered its revenue forecast, citing reduced government travel, California wildfires, and weaker demand trends. However, its stock managed to jump 8.7%, as the airline announced new baggage fees and loyalty program adjustments to boost revenue.Meanwhile, Oracle dropped 3.7% after reporting disappointing quarterly earnings, adding to the broader market’s woes.Amid the turmoil, Tesla shares rose 2.1% after Trump publicly declared his intention to purchase a Tesla vehicle as a show of support for Elon Musk’s company. Tesla’s stock has been under heavy pressure in 2025, down 43.8% year-to-date, partly due to Musk’s involvement in federal budget-cutting efforts.Other Big Tech stocks, which powered the S&P 500 to record highs last year, showed relative stability. Nvidia gained 1%, though its year-to-date loss remains at 19.6%, as Wall Street rethinks its overheated enthusiasm for artificial intelligence stocks.The tech sector’s relative resilience has been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise turbulent market environment. Just seven megacap stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—accounted for more than half of the S&P 500’s total gains in 2024. However, analysts at Citi warn that “US exceptionalism is at least pausing”, suggesting that the AI boom may not be enough to offset the broader economic uncertainty in the coming months.International stock markets mirrored Wall Street’s struggles, with major European and Asian indices mostly posting declines. However, in China, Shanghai’s composite index rose 0.4%, as the Chinese government wrapped up its annual national congress with promises of economic stimulus measures.Meanwhile, US Treasury yields steadied after recent declines, with the 10-year yield rising slightly to 4.24%. The bond market has been under pressure in recent months, reflecting growing concerns about economic slowdown risks.Amid the market chaos, a new report showed that US employers posted 7.7 million job openings in January, matching economist expectations. While the job market remains solid for now, ongoing trade disruptions and market uncertainty could have long-term economic consequences.","US stock markets tumbled further on Tuesday after President Donald Trump intensified his trade war.

US job openings climbed to 7.7 million in January, reinforcing the strength of the labour market as President Donald Trump began his return to the White House. The Labour Department’s latest report, released Tuesday, showed an increase from December’s 7.5 million job postings, highlighting a still-resilient employment landscape.Despite this growth, uncertainty looms over the job market as the Trump administration pushes forward with trade disputes, federal workforce cuts, and immigration crackdowns, according to news agency AP.The report, known as the Job Openings and Labour Turnover Survey (JOLTS), showed a slight decline in layoffs and an uptick in the number of Americans voluntarily leaving their jobs—a sign of worker confidence. Job openings increased in key sectors such as real estate, healthcare, manufacturing, and construction.However, federal government job postings dipped to 135,000 in January, down from 138,000 in December. The impact of layoffs stemming from billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiatives is expected to become more apparent in February’s labour data.“These January numbers only capture the earliest days of the DOGE-driven reductions in federal employment,” economists Carol Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics noted in a report. “While this data doesn’t yet reflect major federal layoffs, we anticipate a significant impact in the February report, set for release on April 1.”The Federal Reserve is unlikely to adjust interest rates based on this report, as it continues its cautious approach to monetary policy. “Today’s data provides no urgency for the Fed to cut rates,” Weinberg and Chen wrote. “The labour market remains stable—at least for now.”Job openings have declined from 8.5 million in January 2024 and the peak of 12.2 million in March 2022, when the economy was still rebounding from COVID-19 shutdowns. Hiring has also slowed compared to previous years: employers added an average of 168,000 jobs per month in 2024, down from 216,000 in 2023, 380,000 in 2022, and a record-breaking 603,000 in 2021.In 2025 so far, the economy added 125,000 jobs in January and 151,000 in February, while the unemployment rate remains at a historically low 4.1%.","US job openings climbed to 7.7 million in January, reinforcing the strength of the labour market as President Donald Trump began his return to the White House.

Driving the news

Tesla shares plunged more than 15% on Monday, extending their brutal year-to-date decline to nearly 45%, as investors worried about slowing sales, increased competition, and CEO Elon Musk ’s growing political entanglements.

plunged more than 15% on Monday, extending their brutal year-to-date decline to nearly 45%, as investors worried about slowing sales, increased competition, and CEO ’s growing political entanglements. Adding to Musk’s woes, his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) suffered widespread outages, with tens of thousands of users reporting disruptions. Musk blamed a ""massive"" cyberattack that he claimed was likely orchestrated by a ""large, coordinated group and/or a country.""

The Tesla's $125 billion market cap wipeout came amid a broader selloff in US stocks. In fact, these twin crises for Musk unfolded against a broader backdrop of market panic. The Nasdaq tumbled 4%, its worst single-day performance since 2022, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones also fell sharply. Investors fear the Trump administration’s shifting stance on tariffs and economic policy could trigger a slowdown. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s warning of a “detox period” as public spending is slashed only heightened those concerns.

Tesla’s post-election rally has evaporated, with shares now trading 11% lower than they were on the day Trump won the presidency.

The big picture

Tesla’s delivery numbers are trending downward, despite aggressive price cuts and financing incentives:

Q1 deliveries are tracking for a 4% drop, according to Evercore ISI.

Tesla has launched 0% financing deals and free Supercharging to stimulate demand.

The Cybertruck launch has been rocky, with initial sales well below Musk’s estimates.

Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury: ""Tesla was already facing increased competition across all price points. Now, politics adds another layer of polarization.""

What they’re saying

Investor Doug Boneparth on X: “Massive crash in Tesla stock. Musk will be fine. Retail investors? Not so much.”

JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman: “For how much longer can the stock remain divorced from the fundamentals?”

Protest organizer Alex Winter (in Rolling Stone): “Detaching Musk from Tesla would be a meaningful blow against this administration … and a strike against what they hold most dear: money and power.”

To Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans, Elon Musk is “putting it on the line” in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World’s great automakers, and Elon’s “baby,” in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for. They tried to do it to me at the 2024 Presidential Ballot Box, but how did that work out? In any event, I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American. Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN??? US President Donald Trump

Between the lines: The #TeslaTakedown movement and Musk’s political troubles

Musk’s response: ‘Always look on the bright side’

X outage: Cyberattack or self-inflicted wounds?

Musk has drastically cut X’s security staff since taking over Twitter, raising questions about whether the outage was due to a cyberattack—or simply self-inflicted infrastructure failures.

Reports indicate that over 40,000 users were affected during peak outages.

Cybersecurity experts say that while botnet attacks are common, Musk’s claim that Ukraine was involved is questionable without further evidence.

Since Musk acquired X, the platform has suffered multiple technical issues—leading some analysts to blame underinvestment in infrastructure.

March 10 was a brutal day for Elon Musk-the world's wealthiest person . Tesla ’s stock took a sharp nosedive, his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) suffered widespread outages due to what he called a “massive cyberattack,” and protests against his leadership role (DOGE) in President Donald Trump ’s administration continued across the US.Musk is facing mounting pressure on multiple fronts: Tesla’s declining sales, political backlash against his role in Trump’s administration, and growing skepticism over the company’s lofty valuation.In Europe, Tesla sales have plummeted this year—down 71% in Germany, 45% in Norway, 44% in France, and 44% in Spain. In China, the company is losing ground to domestic competitors offering cheaper and more advanced electric vehicles. Even in the US, Tesla has resorted to aggressive discounts, low-interest financing, and free Supercharging to prop up demand.Competition is heating up, with China’s BYD surpassing Tesla in EV sales and rolling out driver-assistance technology as a free feature—undercutting Tesla’s pricey Full Self-Driving (FSD) package.For years, Musk’s cult-like following helped insulate Tesla from market realities. But now, that aura is fading, especially as his deepening ties to the Trump administration alienate a growing segment of consumers.Musk’s role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—the administration’s controversial effort to slash federal agencies—has made him a polarizing political figure. His sweeping layoffs and budget cuts have sparked backlash, including nationwide protests at Tesla dealerships.The #TeslaTakedown movement has gained traction on social media, urging Tesla owners to ditch their vehicles and investors to dump their stock. Protesters gathered outside Tesla showrooms in multiple cities over the weekend, with signs reading “Stop Musk’s Crime Spree” and “Elon is Trump’s Executioner.” Some Tesla owners have even defaced or covered up their car’s logo to distance themselves from Musk, the Axios report said.Adding fuel to the fire, Musk himself has embraced right-wing rhetoric, frequently engaging with controversial figures on X. His political leanings, once seen as a sideshow, are now becoming a business liability. A growing number of consumers are rethinking their Tesla purchases, unwilling to support a CEO they view as aligned with the administration’s most extreme policies.Even some investors are starting to wonder if Musk’s political involvement is distracting him from running Tesla. The company has fallen behind in key areas—its long-promised $25,000 car was quietly scrapped last year, while competitors like China’s BYD are racing ahead with innovations. Tesla’s recent focus on robot axis and AI-driven vehicles has yet to materialize into tangible revenue, making the stock’s once-lofty valuation harder to justify.According to a report in Axios, even as his personal net worth took a $16 billion hit on March 10, Musk appeared unfazed.Asked about Tesla’s struggles in a Fox Business interview, Musk laughed it off, quoting Monty Python: ""Always look on the bright side of life!""In the past too, Musk has quoted Monty Python.His confidence has long reassured Tesla investors, but some are starting to question whether the optimism is still warranted.Tesla’s path forward is uncertain. While Musk insists the company will be fine long-term, it faces serious short-term challenges:Can Tesla reverse its sales slump? Musk has promised a $25,000 EV, but no firm timeline exists.Will political backlash grow? The #TeslaTakedown movement is planning more protests, and some Tesla owners are even selling their cars in protest.How will tariffs impact Tesla? Trump’s looming trade war with China and Europe could further hurt Tesla’s supply chain.Can Musk stabilize X? With user engagement already declining, continued outages and security concerns could push advertisers and users away.Tesla’s stock has always defied gravity—but for the first time in years, investors are wondering whether Musk’s magic is wearing off.(With inputs from agencies)","Tesla shares plunged more than 15% on Monday, extending their brutal year-to- date decline to nearly 45%.

US stocks tumbled Monday as ongoing tariff disputes and concerns over a potential federal government shutdown fueled fears of a looming recession.Last week's sharp selloff continued, gaining steam throughout the session, with all three major indexes posting steep losses.The S&P 500 is now down over 8% from its February 19 all-time high, and the Nasdaq Composite has officially entered correction territory after falling more than 10% from its December peak. A mix of economic uncertainty, fears of a potential recession, and escalating trade tensions has led to a wave of selloffs, wiping out trillions in market value.Also read: BSE Sensex sinks over 400 points; Nifty50 below 22,350 Key factors contributing to this decline include high stock valuations compared to historical averages, economic uncertainty triggered by shifting trade policies, and disappointing corporate earnings. Tesla, for example, saw its market value drop by more than $125 billion in a single day. Additionally, companies like Delta Air Lines have cut their profit forecasts, citing concerns over economic conditions. Investors remain on edge as they monitor upcoming inflation reports, interest rate policies, and potential government actions to stabilize the economy.The recent selloff is driven by multiple factors, including trade policy uncertainties, fears of a potential recession, and concerns over high stock valuations. As Peter Orszag, CEO of Lazard, explains: ""The amount of uncertainty that has been created by the tariff wars with regard to Canada, Mexico and Europe is causing boards and C-suites to reconsider the pathway forward.""The S&P 500 has fallen over 8.6% from its February 19 high, erasing more than $4 trillion in market value. The Nasdaq Composite is officially in correction territory, down over 10% from its December peak.Technology stocks have suffered the most significant losses. Tesla lost $125 billion in value in a single day, while Apple and Nvidia both fell about 5%. The S&P 500’s technology sector dropped 4.3% overall. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines' stock plunged 14% after it cut its first-quarter profit estimates by half.Read also: What could be the impact of Trump's tariff flip flop on Indian stock market? Yes, investor concerns about a potential recession have intensified.In an interview broadcast on Sunday, US President Donald Trump described the current situation as “a period of transition” and didn't dismiss the possibility of a recession. When asked on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo” whether he anticipated a recession this year, Trump replied, “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big.”Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird, noted: ""The Trump administration seems a little more accepting of the idea that they’re OK with the market falling, and they’re potentially even OK with a recession in order to exact their broader goals.""The White House has pushed back against recession fears , insisting that the economy remains strong despite the market downturn. Kevin Hassett, head of the National Economic Council, said: ""There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward. But for sure, this quarter, there are some blips in the data.""He also suggested that the uncertainty around tariffs would be resolved soon, emphasizing that tax cuts would help boost investment and real wages. However, investors remain skeptical, with ongoing market volatility reflecting broader concerns.Investors are keeping an eye on several key factors, including the upcoming inflation report, interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve, and potential government measures to stabilize the economy. A further retreat in investor confidence could push markets even lower. As Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""Many people have been worried about elevated valuations among US equities for some time and looking for the catalyst for a market correction.""With market volatility continuing, investors should stay informed and consider diversification strategies to manage risk.","The S&P 500 has fallen over 8.6% from its February 19 high, erasing more than $4 trillion in market value.

Artificial intelligence at work



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Almost every day, Grant Lee, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, hears from investors who try to persuade him to take their money. Some have even sent him and his co-founders personalised gift baskets.Lee, 41, would normally be flattered. In the past, a fast-growing startup like Gamma, an artificial intelligence company he helped establish in 2020, would have constantly looked out for more funding. But like many young startups in Silicon Valley today, Gamma is pursuing a different strategy. It is using AI tools to increase its employees’ productivity in everything from customer service and marketing to coding and customer research.That means Gamma, which makes software that lets people create presentations and websites, has no need for more cash, Lee said. His company has hired only 28 people to get “tens of millions” in annual recurring revenue and nearly 50 million users. Gamma is also profitable. “If we were from the generation before, we would easily be at 200 employees,” Lee said. “We get a chance to rethink that, basically rewrite the playbook.”The old Silicon Valley model dictated that startups should raise a huge sum of money from venture capital investors and spend it hiring an army of employees to scale up fast. Profits would come much later. Until then, head count and fundraising were badges of honour among founders, who philosophised that bigger was better.But Gamma is among a growing cohort of startups, most of them working on AI products, that are also using AI to maximise efficiency. They make money and are growing fast without the funding or employees they would have needed before. The biggest bragging rights for these startups are for making the most revenue with the fewest workers. Stories of “tiny team” success have now become a meme, with techies excitedly sharing lists that show how Anysphere, a startup that makes the coding software Cursor, hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than two years with just 20 employees, and how ElevenLabs, an AI voice startup, did the same with about 50 workers.The potential for AI to let startups do more with less has led to wild speculation about the future. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has predicted there could someday be a one-person company worth $1 billion. His company, which is building a cost-intensive form of AI called a foundational model, employs more than 4,000 people and has raised more than $20 billion in funding. It is also in talks to raise more money.With AI tools, some startups are now declaring that they will stop hiring at a certain size. Runway Financial, a finance software company, has said it plans to top out at 100 employees because each of its workers will do the work of 1.5 people. Agency, a startup using AI for customer service, also plans to hire no more than 100 workers.“It’s about eliminating roles that are not necessary when you have smaller teams,” said Elias Torres, Agency’s founder. The idea of AI-driven efficiency was bolstered in Jan by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that showed it could build AI tools for a small fraction of the typical cost. Its breakthrough, built on open-source tools that are freely available online, set off an explosion of companies building new products using DeepSeek’s inexpensive techniques.“DeepSeek was a watershed moment,” said Gaurav Jain, an investor at the venture firm Afore Capital, which has backed Gamma. “The cost of compute is going to go down very, very fast, very quickly.” Jain compared new AI startups to the wave of companies that arose in the late 2000s, after Amazon began offering cheap cloud computing services. That lowered the cost of starting a company, leading to a flurry of new startups that could be built more cheaply.Before this AI boom, startups generally burned $1 million to get to $1 million in revenue, Jain said. Now, getting to $1 million in revenue costs one-fifth as much and could eventually drop to one-tenth, according to an analysis of 200 startups conducted by Afore. “This time, we’re automating humans as opposed to just the data centers,” Jain said.But if startups can become profitable without spending much, that could become a problem for venture capital investors, who allocate tens of billions to invest in AI startups. Last year, AI companies raised $97 billion in funding, making up 46% of all venture investment in the United States, according to PitchBook, which tracks startups. “Venture capital only works if you get money into the winners,” said Terrence Rohan, an investor with Otherwise Fund, which focuses on very young startups.",Gamma is using AI tools to increase its employees’ productivity in everything from customer service and marketing to coding and customer research. The old Silicon Valley model dictated that startups should raise a huge sum of money from venture capital investors and spend it hiring an army of employees.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118858808,imgsize-479820,width-400,resizemode-4/118858808.jpg"

China retaliated against President Donald Trump's tariffs with an additional 15% tax on key American farm products, including chicken, pork, soybeans and beef.The escalating trade tensions punished US markets Monday as investors fearful of the damage from from Trump's trade wars put their money elsewhere.The Chinese tariffs, announced last week, were a response to Trump's decision to double the levy on Chinese imports to 20% on March 4. China's Commerce Ministry had earlier said that goods already in transit would be exempt from the retaliatory tariffs until April 12.Imposing tariffs on imports is a key part of Trump's agenda. He believes the import taxes can raise money for the Treasury, protect American industries and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants in a range of issues, including immigration and drug trafficking.On Wednesday, Trump is set to remove exceptions on 25% steel tariffs he imposed in 2018 - effectively raising the taxes - and raise his levy on aluminum from 10% to 25%.In a bewildering series of announcements last week, Trump slapped tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, then delayed many of them for 30 days. Next month, he could plaster ""reciprocal tariffs'' - meant to raise U.S. tariffs to match higher tariffs imposed by foreign countries - on a wide range of imports from around the world.Economists warn that tariffs raise prices for consumers and make the US economy less efficient as protected American companies have less incentive to innovate.There's also the threat of retaliation, and farmers, who are among Trump's most loyal supporters and also have vigilant defenders in Congress, make a tempting target.China also hit American farm products during the president's first-term trade wars. US farm sales to China plummeted, then recovered after the two countries reached a truce in January 2020 and Beijing promised to buy more from US farmers. American farm exports to China peaked at $38 billion in 2022, then fell to $29 billion in 2023 and $25 billion last year. In January, they were down 56% from a year earlier, according to the US Department of Agriculture.During his first term, Trump spent tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer money to compensate farmers for lost exports.","China retaliated against President Donald Trump's tariffs with an additional 15% tax on key American farm products.

Wall Street’s sell-off deepened Monday, with growing concerns about the economy and President Donald Trump’s tariffs driving US stocks further from their recent record highs.In early trading, the S&P 500 dropped 1.4%, following its worst week since September. As of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 430 points, or 1%, and the Nasdaq composite had fallen 2.1%, according to news agency AP.The primary US stock market measure is now headed for its seventh swing of more than 1%, up or down, in the last eight days, after a tumultuous period dominated by fears that Trump’s on-and-off tariffs could either directly harm the economy or create enough uncertainty to paralyze US companies and consumers. The S&P 500 is down 7.4% from its all-time high reached on February 19.The economy has shown signs of weakening, mainly reflected in surveys indicating increased pessimism. Additionally, a real-time collection of indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests the US economy could already be contracting.When asked over the weekend about the possibility of a recession in 2025, Trump told Fox News Channel, “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing.” He added, “It takes a little time. It takes a little time.”On the same weekend, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would take effect Wednesday.While the US job market remains stable and the economy ended last year with solid growth, economists are lowering their forecasts for 2025. For instance, at Goldman Sachs, David Mericle revised his US economic growth estimate to 1.7% from 2.2% for the end of 2025, primarily due to higher-than-expected tariffs. He now sees a one-in-five chance of a recession in the next year.The sell-off has notably hit some of Wall Street’s biggest stars the hardest, particularly Big Tech stocks and companies benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom in recent years.Nvidia dropped another 2.6% on Monday, bringing its year-to-date loss to 18.3%, a stark contrast to its nearly 820% surge in 2023 and 2024.Apple also saw a 3.2% decline, making it the heaviest drag on the S&P 500 after confirming that it would delay the AI update to its Siri personal assistant until 2026.The downward trend isn't limited to Big Tech; investors are also pulling back on various investments that had previously seen unstoppable momentum, including bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s value has dropped to around $83,000 from more than $106,000 in December.In the midst of this uncertainty, investors have flocked to US Treasury bonds as a safer bet. This surge in demand has led to higher Treasury prices and lower yields.The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.24% from 4.32% late Friday. It has been on a downward trend since January when it was nearing 4.80%, amid growing economic concerns.On Wall Street, Redfin saw a sharp 77% increase after Rocket announced it would acquire the digital real estate brokerage in an all-stock deal valued at $1.75 billion. Rocket’s stock, however, sank 9.7%.Internationally, European indexes also dropped, following a mixed session in Asia.Indexes in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell 1.8% and 0.2%, respectively, after China reported that consumer prices fell in February for the first time in 13 months. This marks the latest indication of weakness in the world’s second-largest economy, as weak demand was exacerbated by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 430 points, or 1%, and the Nasdaq composite had fallen 2.1%.

What is deflation and why are economists worried?

The ongoing price decreases have negatively impacted business earnings, employee compensation and government revenue. Sustained deflation could potentially result in diminished business investments and reduced consumer spending, says a Bloomberg report.

What’s causing deflation?

Four Flash Sales in a day in China

Rising prices or inflation is a common headache for economies around the world. But what about falling prices? Believe it or not, a sustained fall in prices, commonly known as deflation, is just as big a concern for governments, as is inflation. And, that’s the issue that the world’s second largest economy, China, is grappling with!Recent data indicates China's consumer price index declined by 0.7% year-on-year in February, falling short of projections, whilst producer prices decreased by 2.2%, continuing a downward trend since September 2022.China’s expanding industrial capacity has contributed to export growth, yet it is simultaneously creating deflationary pressures domestically.According to a Reuters report, February's consumer price index recorded its steepest decline in 13 months, alongside persistent producer price deflation. This downturn reflects reduced seasonal demand and consumer hesitancy in spending, influenced by employment and income uncertainties.Also Read | ‘Elon Musk doing amazing work, but…’: Why Sajjan Jindal believes Tesla won’t find it easy in India Following Beijing's recent pledge to enhance consumption amidst escalating US trade tensions, analysts anticipate continued deflationary pressures in China's economy, the report said.Deflation occurs when prices of goods and services decrease across the board. During such periods, currency value increases with time. For many years, economists have expressed concerns about deflation.Whilst deflation appears advantageous for consumers, who can buy more with their income over time, the effects of falling prices are not universally beneficial. Economists worry about how price decreases affect different economic sectors.Also Read | Donald Trump's tariffs: India may be among least vulnerable Asian economies in trade war with US - but there's a catch! China's deepening deflationary concerns may continue beyond temporary seasonal variations, unless governmental action addresses the surplus production capacity that's affecting price levels.Financial institutions such as Citigroup Inc. and Nomura Holdings Inc. express concern that consumer prices might remain near negative territory throughout the year if domestic production continues to exceed consumer demand.With the People's Bank of China currently focusing on maintaining yuan stability rather than implementing monetary stimulus, addressing deflation will likely depend on policymakers' success in managing excess production capacity, the Bloomberg report said.As noted by Citigroup economists, including Xinyu Ji, whilst rebuilding consumer confidence could require several months and largely depends on property market stabilisation, China's approach to supply-side reforms would be crucial for addressing factory-level deflation.China's rising youth joblessness, at 15.7%, is affecting consumer spending. With employment and income uncertainties, Chinese shoppers are increasingly patronising discount retailers, even as industrial production grows despite weak household spending.Financial experts indicate that the growth of such discount businesses is contributing to deflationary trends, which could impact economic growth as these shops gain popularity over traditional retailers, similar to Japan's experience in the 1990s.""The broader shift toward more value-for-money purchases will play a role in deflationary pressures,"" Lynn Song, chief Greater China economist at ING was quoted as saying by Reuters.""This sort of intense price competition likely adds some pressure on more traditional retail models as well,” Song said.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know In its report, Reuters quoted an interesting example, symptomatic of China’s deflation.At the expansive Wankelai establishment in Beijing, manager Leo Liu conducts sales through a microphone, offering increasingly substantial discounts during flash sales until he successfully sells items including a cotton jacket and a ladies' undershirt.Reflecting China's deflationary economic conditions, Liu secured a buyer for the jacket at 20 yuan, a fraction of its original 239 yuan ($33) price tag. The 39-yuan undershirt had to be given away as no customers were willing to purchase it!The store, which offers clothing, snacks and everyday household items near Beijing's financial district, conducts these sales four times daily!Widespread price reductions have emerged across sectors, from eateries offering 3-yuan breakfast deals to automotive manufacturer BYD reducing one of its vehicle prices to under $10,000.Local coffee chain Luckin has overtaken Starbucks as the market leader by offering more affordable options.","Deflation occurs when prices of goods and services decrease across the board.

Seven & i Holdings Ltd announced that its convenience store brand 7-Eleven is planning to explore potential store sell-offs with Canadian firm Alimentation Couche-Tard (ACT).This decision follows a series of measures introduced by Seven & i just days ago to counter a takeover bid from ACT, while also addressing antitrust concerns ahead of a possible merger.""Joint outreach by financial advisors to ACT and 7&i to potential buyers has begun,"" the parent firm said in a statement.The company, which has fully owned 7-Eleven, the world's largest convenience store brand, since 2005, is now taking steps to determine if a deal could be structured in a way that satisfies regulators.ACT has agreed to work with Seven & i to outline a divestiture plan, which includes defining the operational, management, and financial aspects of the stores that could be sold, as well as identifying potential buyers.“This would provide some insight into the prospects of success along terms that had a reasonable likelihood of satisfying US antitrust regulators,” the company added.Seven & i believes these discussions will help determine whether a “credible and actionable remedy and divestiture package can be achieved that would allow a realistic assessment of ACT's proposal.""Earlier, the company had announced a major share buyback and plans to list its US unit on the stock market, another development in an ongoing procedure that began last year when it rejected ACT’s initial $40 billion buyout offer.Seven & i dismissed the bid in September, arguing that it undervalued the business majorly and would likely face regulatory obstacles. If the deal were to go ahead, it would mark the biggest-ever foreign takeover of a Japanese firm, bringing together the 7-Eleven and Circle K brands to create a global convenience store giant.Japan’s Yomiuri daily reported that ACT’s revised offer, which was reportedly raised to around $47 billion, has already been rejected by a special committee.Seven & i has also appointed its first foreign CEO, Stephen Dacus.The company operates around 85,000 convenience stores worldwide, with about a quarter of them located in Japan, where 7-Eleven serves in daily life items, selling everything from fresh rice balls to concert tickets.ACT, which started with a single store in Quebec in 1980, now runs nearly 17,000 convenience stores worldwide, including Circle K.",7-Eleven's parent firm Seven & i Holdings Ltd is planning to explore potential store sell-offs with Canadian firm Alimentation Couche-Tard (ACT) This decision follows a series of measures introduced by Seven &i just days ago to counter a takeover bid from ACT.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118830828,imgsize-91110,width-400,resizemode-4/118830828.jpg"

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

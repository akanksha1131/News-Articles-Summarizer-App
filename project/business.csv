In a financial disclosure report released on Friday, Donald Trump declared over $600 million in earnings from various ventures including cryptocurrency , golf establishments, licensing agreements and other business interests, reported Reuters.The financial report, apparently covering the 2024 calendar year, indicates that the president's cryptocurrency investments significantly enhanced his wealth, alongside substantial development fees and revenue from other enterprises. The president's total declared assets amount to at least $1.6 billion, according to Reuters calculations.Despite Trump's assertion that his business interests are managed by a trust under his children's supervision, the disclosures reveal that income from these sources ultimately benefits the president, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.Certain business ventures, particularly in cryptocurrency, have benefited from policy changes under his administration, drawing criticism.The financial disclosure, reportedly signed on June 13, did not specify its coverage period. However, the cryptocurrency details and other information suggest coverage through December 2024, excluding most earnings from the family's recent cryptocurrency ventures.The document represents a specific moment in time, capturing the family's initial foray into cryptocurrency while maintaining their traditional interests in property development and golf establishments.The president's meme coin, $TRUMP, launched this year, has generated approximately $320 million in fees, though the distribution between Trump-controlled entities and partners remains unclear.Beyond meme coin earnings, the Trump family has accumulated over $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralised finance organisation. Their portfolio also includes bitcoin mining operations and digital asset exchange-traded funds.The disclosures show Trump received $57.35 million from World Liberty token sales and holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture.The Republican president's wealth spans cryptocurrency to real estate, with a significant portion linked to his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social.Beyond business venture assets and revenues, the president reported minimum earnings of $12 million from passive investments totalling at least $211 million, including interest and dividends, according to Reuters calculations.His primary investments were in Blue Owl Capital Corp and government bond funds managed by Charles Schwab and Invesco.The disclosure provided value ranges for assets and income; Reuters used minimum values, suggesting higher actual totals.The report also detailed income from various Florida properties. His three golf resorts - Jupiter, Doral and West Palm Beach - plus Mar-a-Lago members' club generated minimum earnings of $217.7 million.Trump National Doral, featuring the Blue Monster course, proved the family's highest income source at $110.4 million. These figures represent revenue rather than net profit.The disclosure highlighted international business interests, including $5 million in Vietnamese development licence fees, $10 million from an Indian project, and nearly $16 million in Dubai licensing fees.Additional royalties came from various sources: $1.3 million from the Greenwood Bible (""the only Bible officially endorsed by Lee Greenwood and President Trump""); $2.8 million from Trump Watches; and $2.5 million from Trump Sneakers and Fragrances.Trump earned $1.16 million from NFT digital trading cards, while First Lady Melania Trump received approximately $216,700 from her NFT collection licensing fees.","Donald Trump declared over $600 million in earnings from various ventures including cryptocurrency, golf establishments, licensing agreements and other business interests.

Gold Strategy and View: Buy on dips

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold is back in focus amidst the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict which has added to its safe haven appeal in times of increased geopolitical tensions and uncertainties. Positive news on the US-China trade deal talks and better-than-expected US economic data have on the other hand diminished demand for gold. As gold price fluctuations continue, investors are wondering which direction gold will move in, and what should their strategy be?Gold prices witnessed heightened volatility last week as escalating geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran took center stage, overshadowing ongoing trade talks and economic data. Israel launched aggressive strikes targeting Iran's nuclear facilities and oil & gas infrastructure, prompting a strong retaliation from Tehran, which significantly intensified the conflict.This sharp escalation has kept market participants on edge, driving a renewed wave of safe-haven demand. As a result, gold prices surged globally and, on the domestic front, crossed the ₹1 lakh mark for the first time, reflecting the elevated risk premium priced into markets.While earlier last week optimism over the US-China trade negotiations and strong US jobs data weighed on bullion, the geopolitical shock quickly reversed sentiment.Additionally, mixed US economic indicators, including cooler-than-expected CPI and stronger non-farm payrolls, added to the uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s next move, though markets are still pricing in a 68% chance of a rate cut by September.Meanwhile, China's central bank continued to boost its gold reserves for a seventh straight month, signaling sustained long-term demand.Overall, gold remained in sharp focus as a safe-haven asset amid an increasingly unstable global backdrop.With traders closely watching further developments in the Middle East that could continue to influence bullion's trajectory.","Gold prices witnessed heightened volatility last week as escalating geopolitical tensions took center stage.

MUMBAI: In its first major fundraising effort since the collapse of its merger with Sony Pictures India, Zee Entertainment Enterprises will raise Rs 2,237 crore from its promoters to finance its growth plans.The company plans to issue up to 16.95 crore convertible warrants at Rs 132 each to Altilis Technologies and Sunbright Mauritius Investments, companies owned by promoters Subhash Chandra and his family, in one or more tranches. Once the warrants are converted into equity within 18 months from the date of allotment, Subhash Chandra and his family's ownership in the broadcaster will increase significantly to 18.39% from 3.99% as of March-end 2025.This will be an important event in Zee's history as the founding family strengthens its control over the company, which has faced takeover threats in the past. The method by which the family is raising Rs 2,237 crore has not been disclosed. Zee's fund-raising initiative comes at a time when it is working to stabilise operations and focus on digital growth after implementing various strategies such as cost-cutting, staff reductions, and investment in new content following the fallout from last year's failed merger with Sony Pictures India. Zee is now looking to build its core business and invest in emerging segments like micro-drama app Bullet.The company has scheduled a shareholder meeting on July 10 to seek approval for the issuance of warrants to its promoters.The warrants are priced higher than the regulatory price of Rs 128.58 each, with the current Zee stock trading at Rs 138 per share. This fundraising plan follows a review of Zee's growth strategies by investment bank JP Morgan, which presented various strategic alternatives to augment and strengthen the company's balance sheet. After considering these alternatives, Zee's board approved the issuance of upto 16.95 crore convertible warrants to promoter group entities on a preferential basis at Rs 132 per warrant.Shubham Shree, representing the promoter group, said: ""The promoters submitted their desire to enhance their shareholding to the board on May 1 when the stock price was at Rs 106.35.

Imports too fell 2.8% to $60.6 billion due to a decline in prices of gold and crude oil.The government, however, drew comfort from an increase in non-petroleum exports, which were up 5.1% at $33 billion.

DEHRADUN/NEW DELHI: Manoj Sharma doesn't fly by the book in the Kedarnath sector — he flies by sight, by wind, by instinct. ""We are flying in one of the world's most unforgiving regions with very little real-time weather support,"" he said. ""Operations in such large numbers are being conducted on pilot observation and visual reference. The weather is very unpredictable and changes very rapidly.""That reality, long known to those in the cockpit, now has the country's attention. In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents — two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage — all on the Kedar route. In one case, a Kestrel Aviation helicopter crash-landed near a road after a mechanical failure, injuring the pilot and damaging a vehicle.This is not an outlier year. In 2022, an Aryan Aviation chopper crashed near Kedarnath, killing seven. In 2023, Uttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority (UCADA) finance controller Amit Saini died after being struck by a tail rotor. And in 2013, a military rescue helicopter went down during flood relief, killing 20.The terrain is tough — but it is not the only challenge. The system built to manage it is, in many ways, still catching up to the traffic it supports.Pilgrimage flights have surged over the past decade, but the region lacks a dedicated air traffic control network.""There is no ATC control nor any weather station in these areas,"" said a veteran pilot. ""Flying in the narrow valley from Gaurikund to Kedarnath needs a lot of experience and safety awareness, as there are no landing sites on this stretch that can be used in an emergency or bad weather."" Another pilot added, ""There is no information provided on routes where major helicopter operations take place. Till such time these issues can't be addressed, these operations should immediately be stopped. ""This month, the civil aviation ministry suspended Aryan Aviation from Char Dham operations and grounded two TransBharat pilots who flew in unsuitable weather, suspending their licences for six months.UCADA — established by the state in 2013 to oversee civil aviation development and safety, including helipad infrastructure and coordination with private operators — has been tasked with conducting a comprehensive review with all operators and setting up a command-and-control room to monitor real-time risks. DGCA has deployed officers to oversee safety, airworthiness and the functioning of the control centre.But many in the sector say these moves fall short. ""It seems there are no checks and balances in place,"" said one chopper operator. ""There is someone who replaced one inoperative part on a chopper with another inoperative part from another chopper to show that the part has been changed. Because of unscrupulous operators, conscientious operators and passengers are suffering.""Others point to a deeper culture of pressure and compromise. ""There have been five chopper crashes in the country within the last 1.5 months, which is the worst we have ever seen in helicopter operations in our country,"" said a senior pilot. ""Char Dham operations are one of the toughest... yet we still fly as if nothing needs fixing.""Another pilot was more direct: ""We need a complete stop on chopper operations for this yatra season. All stakeholders — owners, pilots, commercial, engineers, DGCA and UCADA — need to look within and change."" One added, simply, ""It's greed. That's what's driving this. Not safety.""","In just six weeks, Uttarakhand has recorded five helicopter accidents. Two of them fatal, others involving emergency landings and rotor damage.

From cars to couture: Kering appoints Renault’s Luca De Meo to lead Gucci; French high-fashion brand hopes for revival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-cars-to-couture-kering-appoints-renaults-luca-de-meo-to-lead-gucci-french-high-fashion-brand-hopes-for-revival/articleshow/121890420.cms,"French high end fashion group Kering appointed Luca de Meo, the man behind rescuing carmaker Renault from crisis, as its new chief executive to steer the company’s struggling flagship brand Gucci back on course.De Meo, 58, will officially take over in September, after shareholders approve of a new governance structure that separates the roles of chairman and CEO. Francois-Henri Pinault, whose family controls Kering’s largest shareholder, will stay on as board chairman.Kering, which owns Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta, described the appointment as “a decisive step in the evolution of Kering’s governance and strengthens the Group’s leadership as it enters a new phase of its development.”Kering’s shares surged nearly 12% on reports of de Meo’s imminent arrival, although the company only confirmed the news after the Paris exchange closed. In contrast, Renault shares dropped 8.7% on Sunday following the announcement that de Meo would step down on 15 July to ""take on new challenges outside the automobile sector.""Luca de Meo is known for turning struggling companies around. He joined Renault in 2020 after the Carlos Ghosn scandal and helped steady the business.He pushed for electric vehicles and focused on more premium models. As a result, Renault avoided the slump that affected rivals and is now aiming for an operating margin of over 7% this year.Kering is counting on de Meo to deliver a similar turnaround at Gucci, which has lost its edge in recent years. Once the group’s main driver of growth, the brand’s slump played a major role in Kering’s 12% drop in revenue to 17.2 billion euros in 2023, while net profit plunged by 64% to 1.1 billion euros. Over the year, Gucci’s own sales fell 23%.In February, Gucci parted ways with creative director Sabato De Sarno after a lacklustre two-year stint. In March, the group named Balenciaga's Demna Gvasalia as chief designer for Gucci, part of a wider leadership reshuffle that also included appointments at Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta.Analysts are cautiously optimistic about de Meo’s appointment. Bernstein noted that “Kering shares have lost 28 percent since the beginning of the year and 78 percent since its peak in mid-2021, a drop largely due to the drop in its leading brand Gucci.”","Luca de Meo, 58, will officially take over in September.

These inflows to these countries made up just 2.3% of their GDP in 2023, roughly half of what they were at their peak in 2008.“What we're seeing is a result of public policy,” said Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist. He further noted that public debt is reaching new highs while investment continues to fall.“In recent years governments have been busy erecting barriers to investment and trade when they should be deliberately taking them down.”The report also flagged a significant drop in new investment treaties, which were once a major driver of global capital flows. Only 380 new investment agreements came into force between 2010 and 2024, less than half the number signed between 2000 and 2009.World Bank deputy chief economist Ayhan Kose said turning this slowdown around “essential for job creation, sustained growth, and achieving broader development goals.”The bank also highlighted that FDI could boost economic growth significantly. Global economic policy uncertainty and geopolitical risk have soared to the highest level since the turn of the century,"" the report said, quoted by AFP.Moreover, FDI remains highly concentrated. Between 2012 and 2023, nearly two-thirds of flows went to just 10 countries: with China, India, and Brazil alone attracting almost half of all investment in emerging and developing markets.

Global outlook

Asian stock markets showed early signs of recovery on Monday following sharp losses last week triggered by intensifying hostilities between Israel and Iran. Investor sentiment remains cautious as the risk of prolonged conflict in the Middle East threatens oil supplies, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy outlooks globally.Brent crude prices surged by as much as 5.5 per cent, while safe-haven currencies and assets showed mixed responses.

JERUSALEM: Indian billionaire Gautam Adani-led group's Haifa port in Israel was unharmed by the Iranian ballistic missile attack, with cargo operations progressing unhampered, sources said.Late on Saturday night, Iran targeted Israel's Haifa port and a nearby oil refinery in response to Tel Avi's attack on Iranian nuclear and other targets earlier this week.Sharpnels fell in the chemical terminal at the port and some other projectiles fell at the oil refinery, two sources aware of the matter said. They claimed there were no injuries.Adani's port, however, was not impacted by the strike.A piece of interceptor shrapnel was also found at the Kishan West (Haifa port) but there were no injuries, they said.Cargo operations at the Adani-operated port were unhampered. ""There are eight ships in the port now, cargo operations are normal,"" a source said.The Iranian ballistic missile attack did not inflict any damage to the port or its operations, the sources claimed.The Adani group did not immediately offer any comments on the issue. Israeli government authorities could not be immediately reached for comments.Haifa port is totally functioning normally, sources said, adding 8 ships were handling cargo as on Sunday.The port has approximately 700 employees. It handles different types of cargo, including containers, bulk, breakbulk, cement and general cargo.Sources said the port is closely coordinating with the ministry of transport in Israel and continue to operate normally with full compliance with security and other requirements of the Israeli government.The Chinese port (which is next to Haifia) is also functioning normally, sources said.Haifa port serves as a crucial maritime hub, handling over 30 per cent of Israel's imports. It is owned by Adani Ports, which controls a 70 per cent share.The missiles may have caused damage to a major oil refinery close to the port but there was no official comment on the impact on it.Haifa is less than 3 per cent of the volume handled by Adani Ports and SEZ and contributed less than 2 per cent to the profits. Haifa handles a total cargo of 10-11 million tonnes annually, while APSEZ annual volumes are upwards of 450 million tonnes.Israel attacked Iran early Friday, targeting its nuclear, missile and military infrastructure. Iran later launched retaliatory strikes on Israel. The two countries traded strikes for a third day on Sunday as the Middle East region braced for a protracted conflict.Iran said Israel struck two oil refineries, raising the prospect of a broader assault on Iran's heavily sanctioned energy industry that could affect global markets. Some Iranian missiles evaded Israeli air defences to strike buildings in the heart of the country.","Iran targeted Israel's Haifa port and a nearby oil refinery in response to Tel Avi's attack on Iranian nuclear and other targets earlier this week.

""The supply chain has probably had a small role in our slight reduction in deliveries over the next 20 years,"" said Boeing vice president of Commercial Marketing Darren Hulst during a briefing last week, as quoted by AFP.This announcement preceded the Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner crash in Ahmedabad on Thursday. In response to the incident, which claimed 279 lives, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg and commercial aircraft division head Stephanie Pope withdrew from the event.Boeing anticipates yearly passenger growth of 4.2 percent, surpassing the 2.3 percent annual GDP growth.

Nippon Steel–US Steel deal approved: Trump signs executive order; contingent on compliance with security agreement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nippon-steelus-steel-deal-approved-trump-signs-executive-order-contingent-on-compliance-with-security-agreement/articleshow/121841927.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order enabling Japanese firm Nippon Steel's investment in US Steel, contingent upon compliance with a government-mandated ""national security agreement"".The joint statement from both companies confirms $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and the provision of a ""golden share"" to the US government, ensuring protection of national security interests regarding steel production. They expressed gratitude to Trump's administration, highlighting the partnership's significance for American manufacturing.Following completion of regulatory approvals and Department of Justice review, the partnership awaits prompt finalisation. US Steel shares increased by $2.66 to $54.85 in Friday's afterhours trading, compared to Nippon Steel's initial bid of $55 per share in late 2023.The acquisition concludes the long-time uncertainty regarding international control of a crucial state resource that started when US Steel and Nippon Steel disclosed their intentions for a $14.9 billion merger in December 2023.Details regarding the golden share mechanism, national security agreement provisions and investment allocation remain limited.White House spokesman Kush Desai emphasised the order's role in maintaining US Steel's presence in Pennsylvania. Legal expert James Brower noted that such agreements typically remain confidential, particularly from the government's perspective.The transaction, originally valued at nearly $15 billion, faced delays due to national security concerns during Biden's presidency. American officials now value it at $28 billion, including the purchase bid and plans for a new electric arc furnace post-2028, reported AP.Nippon Steel committed to maintaining Pittsburgh headquarters, establishing an American-majority board, protecting plant operations and trade interests, while avoiding steel slab imports that would compete with US blast furnaces.Trump, initially opposing the purchase, later showed willingness to negotiate. He claimed ""total control"" through the golden share, though Nippon Steel maintains its intention for full ownership.The order acknowledges potential national security risks but suggests adequate mitigation through the security agreement. The Treasury Department and CFIUS agencies must approve the agreement's execution by the transaction's closing date, with Trump retaining authority for further actions.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order enabling Japanese firm Nippon Steel's investment in US Steel.

Trump-Musk feud continues? White House orders review of SpaceX contracts after fallout: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-musk-feud-continues-white-house-orders-review-of-spacex-contracts-after-fallout-report/articleshow/121841289.cms,"Elon Musk with Donald Trump in Oval office (File photo)

The White House instructed the Defense Department and Nasa earlier this month to examine details of SpaceX contracts worth billions following President Donald Trump's public disagreement with Elon Musk , according to four sources familiar with the directive who spoke to Reuters.The administration instructed these agencies to examine Musk's contracts to prepare potential actions against the entrepreneur and his enterprises, these sources indicated. Pentagon officials are also evaluating whether to limit SpaceX's involvement in a new American missile defence initiative, as Reuters reported on Thursday.While the ultimate intention regarding SpaceX's current federal contracts worth approximately $22 billion remains unclear, the assessment will mark the administration's follow-through on Trump's June 6 statement to journalists aboard Air Force One, where he mentioned possible termination of business and subsidies for Musk's ventures, stating ""We'll take a look at everything.""A White House spokesperson, responding via email to Reuters, avoided specific questions about Musk's operations, stating the ""Trump administration is committed to a rigorous review process for all bids and contracts."" Nasa's spokesperson separately indicated the agency would maintain collaboration with industry partners to achieve presidential space objectives.Sources familiar with the directive indicated the contract review aims to enable swift administrative action should Trump decide to move against Musk, who previously served as a senior presidential adviser and led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).One source characterised the review as ""for political ammunition.""The feasibility of legally cancelling existing contracts remains uncertain. However, the situation highlights governance experts' worries about political and personal influences potentially affecting government spending, national security and public interest matters.Another Reuters report on Friday cited three people familiar with the project, claiming that the feud called into question the role of Musk's SpaceX in the new US missile defense system. Until recently, the White House considered a plan for SpaceX, Musk's rocket and satellite venture, to partner with software maker Palantir and drone builder Anduril to construct crucial elements of the project, dubbed ""Golden Dome. "" These people said the administration instructed the Pentagon to prioritize a network of satellites for the purpose.A new framework aimed at tracking and preventing potential missile attacks against the United States is currently under consideration, which could reduce SpaceX's involvement. Three individuals stated that one option might initially forego SpaceX's satellite capabilities to focus on expanding existing ground-based missile defence systems instead.Scott Amey, a contracting specialist at Washington's Project on Government Oversight, noted the situation's paradox, where Musk's contracts face similar subjective political scrutiny that his DOGE team applied to numerous other contracts, emphasising that decisions should prioritise public and national security interests over personal disputes.SpaceX has become essential to American government aerospace and defence operations, managing satellite launches and potentially overseeing a crucial component of Trump's ""Golden Dome"" missile defence system.Despite Musk's recent attempts to moderate his presidential criticisms, including his (now-deleted posts) impeachment call and allegations linking Trump to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his outbursts highlighted government dependence on SpaceX.Before his reversal, Musk suggested decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft, currently America's sole means of transporting astronauts to and from the International Space Station under a £5 billion Nasa contract.Additionally, SpaceX is developing a classified satellite network for the National Reconnaissance Office, strengthening its relationship with American defence and intelligence communities.The feud between Musk and Trump intensified after the Tesla owner criticised Trump’s key domestic bill, describing it as a “disgusting abomination” and alleging that Trump’s name appeared in unreleased Jeffrey Epstein files—a post Musk subsequently deleted. In response, Trump called Musk “a big-time drug addict” and mocked his appearance during a recent Oval Office visit.However, the tensions seemed to ease when Musk expressed ""regret"" saying he went too far. “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far,” Musk wrote Wednesday on the platform he owns. In response, the White House signalled a possible softening of tone. “The President acknowledged the statement that Elon put out this morning, and he is appreciative of it,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.",The White House instructed the Defense Department and Nasa earlier this month to examine details of SpaceX contracts worth billions.

Similarly, the Model X AWD now costs $89,990, and the Model X Plaid is listed at $104,990, Reuters reported.Earlier, Elon Musk announced Tuesday that Tesla is ""tentatively"" launching its long-anticipated robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22. The move marks a significant leap in Tesla’s autonomous driving ambitions, with Musk emphasizing a cautious approach: “We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,” he said in a post on social media platform X.Musk also noted that the first Tesla to fully self-drive from the end of the production line to a customer’s home is scheduled for June 28—an industry-first if achieved.The vehicles involved in the rollout are reportedly unmodified Tesla Model Ys, built with the Full Self-Driving (FSD) software pre-installed and capable of operating without human intervention.A recent video circulating online showed a Model Y in Austin, branded with a “Robotaxi” logo, transporting a passenger without a driver onboard. Musk confirmed the footage, stating that ""every Tesla coming out of our factories is capable of unsupervised self-driving. ""This announcement brings Tesla closer to fulfilling a promise Musk has been making for years—commercializing fully autonomous vehicles.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are likely to remain volatile this week, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. The expert shares his outlook for gold prices in the near term:Gold and silver witnessed another volatile yet constructive last week, with prices rebounding sharply after aggressive liquidation at the start of this month, as forced unwinding eased and value buying emerged across both metals. The earlier correction—triggered by a sharp dollar rebound, shifting Fed expectations, easing geopolitical risk premiums and heavy speculative positioning—appears to have run its course for now, allowing bullion to stabilise and recover.Gold rebounded decisively from the ₹141,000 zone, forming a clear V-shaped recovery on daily charts, while prices continue to sustain well above the key momentum pivot of ₹138,000, keeping the broader trend positive. Bollinger Bands, which had compressed during the correction, have begun to expand again with prices moving towards the upper band, signalling a revival in directional strength supported by improving volumes.Immediate support for gold is seen near ₹150,000 followed by ₹143,000, while the earlier target of ₹155,000 has been achieved; any sustained close above this level could open the path towards ₹165,000 and ₹171,000 from a short to medium-term perspective.Despite a relatively firm dollar and lingering policy uncertainty, safe-haven demand remains underpinned by central-bank buying, renewed geopolitical and fiscal concerns. Domestically, a rebound in USDINR from recent lows has lent support to MCX prices.Markets will remain sensitive this week to US inflation, retail sales, PMI data and the delayed non-farm payrolls release, along with policy commentary, which are likely to keep intraday swings sharp even as the broader bullion bias stays supportive.","Gold prices are likely to remain volatile this week, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

Stock market today: Nifty and Sensex, the main benchmark indices, closed in green on Tuesday buoyed by global sentiment and positive cues following the India-US trade deal joint statement last weekend.The NSE Nifty advanced 67.85 points, or 0.26 per cent, to settle at 25,935.15, after climbing 122.15 points, or 0.47 per cent, to reach a session high of 25,989.45.

Provident Fund withdrawals via UPI soon! New EPFO app to have several subscriber-friendly features; check details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/wealth/retirement-planning/provident-fund-withdrawals-via-upi-soon-new-epfo-app-to-have-several-subscriber-friendly-features-check-details/articleshow/128113030.cms,"Representative image generated by AI (Gemini)

New app to add UPI withdrawal



Reducing claim delays and improving access



In a move aimed at modernising retirement fund access, EPFO is working on a new mobile application that may allow subscribers to withdraw a portion of their EPF savings instantly through the UPI payment gateway. The app, expected to be launched around April, is part of efforts to reduce claim processing time and improve digital service delivery, sources told PTI.The labour ministry is working on a project where a certain proportion of EPF will be frozen, while a large portion will be available for withdrawal through bank accounts using Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the source said.The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation is set to roll out a new dedicated mobile application through which members will be able to withdraw EPF money using the UPI gateway and access services such as passbook balance, the source said.Currently, members use the Universal Account Number (UAN) portal or the UMANG app to access EPF services. The source said these platforms will continue to function, while the new app is expected to further improve accessibility and service delivery for subscribers.Subscribers will be able to view the eligible EPF balance available for transfer to their seeded bank accounts through the mobile application. They will be able to use their linked UPI PIN to complete transactions, ensuring secure transfer of funds to bank accounts.The EPFO is currently conducting trials using 100 dummy accounts to improve system efficiency and remove possible technical glitches. The labour ministry is likely to launch the new app with a major rollout event in April, the source said.At present, EPFO members must file withdrawal claims to access EPF money, a process that can be time-consuming. Under the auto-settlement mode, claims are settled electronically without manual intervention within three days of filing the application.The auto-settlement withdrawal limit has already been increased to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 1 lakh earlier, allowing members to access funds faster for illness, education, marriage and housing purposes.EPFO, which has about 8 crore members, first introduced online auto-settlement of advance claims during the COVID-19 pandemic to help members facing financial stress. However, members still need to file claims to access EPF funds.The new system is being developed to eliminate this time-consuming process and reduce the operational burden on EPFO, which settles over 5 crore claims annually, mostly related to EPF withdrawals.The source said EPFO cannot allow direct withdrawal from EPF accounts because it does not have banking licences, but the government aims to upgrade EPFO services to match banking-level convenience.","EPFO is working on a new mobile application that may allow subscribers to withdraw a portion of their EPF savings instantly.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the main stock market benchmarks, rose in opening trade on Wednesday as global cues remained positive and optimism around the India-US trade deal continued. While Nifty was near the 26,000 mark, BSE Sensex rose over 100 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,983.75, up 49 points or 0.19%. BSE Sensex was at 84,403.92, up 130 points or 0.15%.Experts are of the view that the broader trend remains mildly positive in the near term, though gains may remain limited unless the benchmarks decisively move above the 26,000 level.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “There are two trends that can sustain the ongoing mild rally in the market. One, this is a comprehensive rally with the broader market, too, participating with more enthusiasm. The appreciation in mid and small caps have brought cheer to retail portfolios and retail investors are participating eagerly in the rally. Two, sustained FII selling, which has been a major drag on the market, has stopped. FIIs have been buyers in the market in the last five out of six trading sessions. This cannot be taken as a complete reversal of the FII stance; but the sustained selling appears to be over.It is also important to note that the around 10 percent depreciation in dollar during the last one year has significantly eroded the dollar gains of foreign investors from investment in the US market. So FIIs might look for markets outside the US for gains this year and beyond. The rupee stability and hope of appreciation in the months ahead also can nudge FIIs to turn buyers in India. Apart from these factors, the improving earnings growth prospects in FY27 and the strong macro construct will provide the fundamental support to a modest rally. An unhealthy trend in the market now is the inflows into gold and silver ETFs exceeding the inflows into active equity funds. This is the time to put more money into equity than to precious metals which have turned highly volatile rather than a safe haven.""In the US stock market, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished lower on Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its third consecutive record closing high. Investors reacted to weaker-than-expected retail sales data and awaited an important labour market report that could provide clearer direction on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate outlook.Across Asia, equities hovered near record levels ahead of the release of key US employment data scheduled for Wednesday. Weak retail sales numbers in the US strengthened expectations that the Federal Reserve may move toward interest rate cuts later this year, supporting regional market sentiment.On the domestic front, foreign portfolio investors were marginal net buyers, purchasing shares worth Rs 69.45 crore on Monday, according to exchange data. Domestic institutional investors remained supportive, recording net purchases of Rs 1,174 crore during the same period.","While Nifty was near the 26,000 mark, BSE Sensex rose over 100 points.

Together, they are seen as crucial in shaping expectations for the Federal Reserve ahead of its March policy gathering.Data released by the US Commerce Department on Tuesday showed retail sales in the United States were unchanged in December, after rising 0.6 per cent in November.The reading gives policymakers some space to consider reducing borrowing costs next month, after they left rates unchanged in January following three straight cuts.But it also highlights signs of caution among consumers, who play a central role in driving growth, and points to the risk of further economic weakness.Some analysts cautioned that the long-standing belief that poor data automatically boosts markets because it raises the chance of rate cuts may no longer hold. In the United States, the Dow managed to edge to another record high, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq slipped, with technology shares among the biggest decliners.There was little response to data indicating that consumer inflation in China slowed last month.

Compliance takes centrestage in boardrooms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/compliance-takes-centrestage-in-boardrooms/articleshow/128175011.cms,"MUMBAI: For Indian companies with a global footprint, navigating regulatory complexity has moved from the sidelines to the centre of corporate strategy. Rules on trade, tariffs, the environment, labour, data, and taxation are changing rapidly and increasingly shaping business outcomes.Import restrictions, carbon taxes, anti-dumping duties, subsidies, and localisation norms are altering cost structures, market access, and competitiveness, directly affecting product pricing, profit margins, and capital allocation. Companies now factor regulation into core business planning, rather than treating it as a compliance exercise. Tata Steel 's management, which oversees operations in India, the UK, the EU and Canada, highlighted this in a recent earnings call. Managing regulatory complexity, CFO Koushik Chatterjee said, has become a strategic imperative across geographies. He pointed to Tata Steel's Netherlands operations as an example. During 9MFY26, the unit reported operating profit of 210 million euros after absorbing carbon emission-related costs of 150 million euros and an impact of 50 million euros from US tariffs. Without these regulatory-linked costs, operating profit would have topped 400 million euros-showing how policy has weighed on the bottom line.Smaller players face similar pressures. Jyoti Steel Industries partner Pankaj Chadha said fast-changing regulations leave little room for manoeuvre, often forcing companies to rely on customers for real-time intelligence. In one case, a Mexican customer told him Japanese steel was cheaper than Indian steel due to a zero-duty trade arrangement versus a 35% import duty on Indian steel. ""Can you believe Japanese steel was cheaper than Indian steel? I had never heard of it until then. Understanding and incorporating regulations is now part of the business. Meetings start with this,"" said Chadha, also chairman of engineering exports body EEPC.Law firm Sarvaank Associates founder Ankita Singh calls this the start of an era of ""regulated strategy,"" where navigating the global legislative maze becomes a competitive advantage. ""Regulatory risk is no longer a cost centre but a survival metric, prompting boards to move from a 'wait and see' approach to a 'preventive vigilance' model, embedding compliance into the very architecture of products and supply chains,"" she said. Madhavan Srivatsan, senior partner at Emerald Law, concurs. ""Gone are the days when Indian companies treated regulatory issues lightly,"" he said. ""With increased regulatory scrutiny, mandatory self-reporting obligations, and the risk of stringent penalties, compliance is now one of the most critical functions.""Responsibility is also moving up the management chain. ""Any instance of non-compliance can expose directors to civil and even criminal liability, in some cases on a strict liability basis where intent is irrelevant,"" Srivatsan said.While conditions have improved for Tata Steel's Netherlands unit after the EU imposed carbon costs on emission-intensive imports from Jan 1, the same measures have raised costs for India's exports of steel, cement, aluminium and fertilisers to the bloc. From June, the EU will also cut import quotas and raise duties on volumes above those limits from 25% to 50%, further favouring domestic producers. Meanwhile, Chadha hopes India cuts a trade deal with Mexico.","For Indian companies with a global footprint, navigating regulatory complexity has moved from the sidelines to the centre of corporate strategy.

Exporters not sweating over US-Bangladesh trade deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/exporters-not-sweating-over-us-bangladesh-trade-deal/articleshow/128174936.cms,"US Cuts Bangladesh Tariffs To 19% Days After India Deal, Redrawing Trade Priorities In South Asia

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh on Monday secured 19% reciprocal tariff from the US under a trade agreement, while managing some exemptions from reciprocal tariffs for textiles and garments manufactured using American material. While Indian exporters are keeping a close watch on the details - especially after some of the stocks took a beating - they are not unduly worried.The reduction in the reciprocal tariff from 20% to 19%, compared with 18% for India, widens the price gap between garments made in Bangladesh and those produced here due to lower wage cost across the border.But the exemption from reciprocal tariffs for Bangladesh-made garments using US cotton and man-made fibre, is unlikely to provide a major edge as it will involve transportation cost and the spinning industry in and around Dhaka is not very competitive.""It was struggling until a few months ago. A large part of the global trade uses man-made fibre. So, we do not have much reason to worry,"" said Premal H Udani, CMD of Kaytee Corporation.Industry estimates suggest that cotton accounts for around 20% of the overall cost and the duty benefit will only be on that component.""Let's wait for the fine print. It doesn't look alarming,"" said Pearl Global Industries MD and group president Pallab Banerjee.Udani said that many international buyers are looking to diversify their sourcing, given the political uncertainty in Bangladesh and India can take advantage of that.""There is nothing to worry, we have got a good deal from the US. In fact, even for India cotton for re-export can be considered for concessions, if there is a 20% value addition,"" said A Sakthivel, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council.Trade research body GTRI said in 2024, Bangladesh exported 63% of its over $50 billion garments to Europe and around 15% went to the US.""In practical terms, a Bangladeshi garment that normally faces a 12% US MFN tariff would attract a total duty of 31% (12% MFN + 19%. For India, the comparable total would be about 30% (12% MFN + 18% reciprocal). But, Bangladeshi garments made with US fibres would avoid the reciprocal duty, paying just the 12% MFN tariff. While this appears to be a significant concession, Bangladesh's export structure and its heavy dependence on non-US textile inputs mean the arrangement is likely to result in only a limited increase in garment exports to the US,"" it said.Besides, it said Bangladesh agreed to offer too many concessions to bag this deal from the US, opening up its market US machinery, chemicals, energy goods, soy, dairy, beef and cotton and has also committed to buy about $3.5 billion of US farm products, energy and aircraft.","The reduction in the reciprocal tariff from 20% to 19%, compared with 18% for India, widens the price gap between garments made in Bangladesh and those produced here. But the exemption from reciprocal tariffs for Bangladesh-made garments using US cotton and man-made fibre, is unlikely to provide a major edge.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128174982,imgsize-987939,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

We know there's a process when you are shifting from globalisation and the challenges that are present to our country. when you are shifting to a more resilient and secure economy. At some point, you have to shift supply chains around, India can be a waystation for that. They have a lot of folks there, manufacturing capacity. Of course, we want to make sure American worker is first, but to the extent we want to import from other countries, India can be a good source as long as it is balanced and it is fair,"" he said in a TV interview. The comments were seen to be supporting India as a ""trusted partner"" in the global supply chain.Greer reiterated that India has started winding down purchases of Russian oil and ramping up supplies from the US. He said that India has also started taking down digital services tax.While describing US-China trade ties as ""stable"", he said that Donald Trump's deals were changing the global trade system in favour of America. ""Just over the past 10 days, we have signed agreements with Argentina, Bangladesh, India, before that with Guatemala and El-Salvador and all these deals open these market more to US exports and they also talk about cooperation in dealing with distortions in the global markets,"" he said, adding that rules are being worked in ways that third country exports are not routed to the US, a comment targeted at Chinese products.Asked about Trump administration's strategy in case of an adverse ruling by the US Supreme Court, Greer said: ""Tariffs are going to be part of the landscape going forward. If the Supreme Court goes the wrong way, then we will find ways to use tools to adjust some of the unfair trade policies that these countries are pursing.""",US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said India could be an alternative to China for American companies looking to diversify their production.

Given that collaborations are becoming all the more important in the face of megatrends such as power train shift, and software-defined vehicles, it makes all the more sense to continue to expand the relationship built on trust and one that has proven to be beneficial for both partners.Puneet Gupta, director for India and ASEAN automotive market at S&P Global Mobility said, ""The Tata-Stellantis MoU reflects that collaboration is the only way forward in a highly uncertain world.

In FY25, PSUs collected Rs 25,623 crore in group premiums but paid out Rs 26,548 crore in claims, translating into an underwriting loss of Rs 925 crore according to the handbook on insurance statistics released by the insurance regulator. Their group claims ratio stood at 103.61%, compared with 87.79% for private insurers and 67.74% for standalone health insurers.According to insurers, the larger the corporates the better their bargaining power.This has resulted in individual covers subsidising the group health business for large corporates considering that the combined ratio (which includes the ratio of claims and management expenses to total premium) is in excess of 100% for group business.At the height of the pandemic in FY22, the industry's overall incurred claims ratio had surged to 109.12%, implying insurers were paying out more in claims than they earned in premiums.

Also, the month's gross inflows through systematic investment plans (SIPs) were at Rs 31,002 crore, barely changed from Dec 2025 figure but still a new all-time high, data released by fund industry trade body AMFI showed.

Gold, Silver Prices Today: Top 10 Things To Know

In global commodity markets, gold prices were around the $5,000-an-ounce mark. Prices climbed up to 1.7% on Monday, recovering nearly half of the losses incurred after retreating sharply from the record high recorded on January 29. Silver continued to display greater volatility, with price movements intensified by speculative activity and relatively limited over-the-counter trading volumes. After dropping by more than one-third from its peak level, the metal gained as much as 5% on Monday, moving back above $80 per ounce. According to Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart, gold is likely to maintain support near $4,555 per troy ounce on a closing basis, while silver could hold above $65 per troy ounce. On the MCX, he estimates gold support at Rs 1,54,000–Rs 1,51,800 and resistance at Rs 1,57,700–Rs 1,60,000. Jain advises accumulating gold within the 154,000–152,000 band, keeping a stop loss below 150,500, with upside targets of 156,800–159,000. For silver, he suggests buying in the 250,000–244,000 range, placing a stop loss below 236,600, and aiming for targets of 2,55,500–2,62,000 and 2,65,500. Market analysts are of the view that the recent sharp surge in silver prices was not primarily driven by industrial demand. Instead, it was largely fuelled by speculative buying, as investors rushed in amid fears of missing further gains. A report by Mirae Asset Mutual Fund noted that while the rally initially rested on familiar and previously credible themes, silver eventually moved well beyond its underlying fundamentals. For years, silver has remained in gold’s shadow, with gold continuing to dominate as the preferred safe-haven during periods of geopolitical uncertainty and concerns over weakening fiat currencies. Both investors and central banks largely favoured gold during such phases. According to Chirag Mehta, CIO at Quantum AMC, the decline in the US dollar and growing doubts surrounding its long-term reserve currency role have been key factors supporting gold’s ongoing rally. Why did gold, silver prices crash in the last few days? The steep rally in recent months encouraged investors to book profits in both metals, adding to the downward pressure on prices. Multiple factors have been linked to the recent sharp correction seen in both gold and silver. The immediate trigger was US President Donald Trump’s backing of former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as his preferred choice to replace current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Markets view Warsh as a policy hawk inclined toward stricter control over inflation and tighter monetary policy. The dollar strengthened against major global currencies, reducing the appeal of such assets and weakening the dollar-debasement narrative.

Rate-cut bets strengthen, bond yields fall

Mixed earnings keep stocks in check

Wall Street stocks traded near record levels on Tuesday as investors digested weak US retail sales data and a mixed set of corporate earnings, boosting expectations that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates later this year.The S&P 500 was marginally higher, briefly sitting just above its all-time high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose around 0.4 per cent to hover near record territory. The Nasdaq Composite also edged up slightly.According to news agency AFP, markets were largely indecisive early in the session as traders balanced concerns about slowing consumer spending with optimism over possible monetary easing.US retail sales data showed no growth in December, missing economists’ expectations and raising concerns about the momentum of the world’s largest economy.Shoppers spent roughly the same in December as in November, signalling potential weakness in household demand, which is the main engine of US economic growth, as per AP.The softer retail data pushed Treasury yields lower, with the benchmark 10-year yield falling to around 4.13 per cent from 4.22 per cent a day earlier, reported news agency AP.Traders also increased bets that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates three times or more this year, according to CME Group data, though most still expect two cuts.The retail sales report comes ahead of key US data releases later this week, including unemployment figures on Wednesday and inflation numbers on Friday. These updates are expected to play a crucial role in shaping the Fed’s interest rate outlook.While stubborn inflation could keep rates higher for longer, signs of labour market weakness may prompt quicker easing.CFRA Research’s Sam Stovall said the data could strengthen the case for additional rate cuts but warned investors must balance this against “the possibility of an economic slowdown”.Corporate earnings offered a mixed picture. Coca-Cola shares slipped after the company reported quarterly revenue growth that fell short of expectations and issued a cautious outlook.S&P Global tumbled after giving a weaker-than-expected profit forecast, amid concerns about competition from AI-driven rivals.In contrast, Hasbro jumped after beating profit and revenue estimates and announcing plans to return up to $1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks.DuPont also gained after posting stronger-than-expected quarterly results and issuing an upbeat profit outlook for 2026.Outside the US, Japan’s Nikkei 225 surged more than 2 per cent to a fresh record, driven by expectations that a newly elected parliament will support tax cuts and pro-growth measures.Other Asian markets saw modest gains, while European indices traded mixed.Overall, markets remained supported by hopes of lower interest rates, even as investors weighed signs of a cooling US economy against resilient corporate performance.","The S&P 500 was marginally higher, briefly sitting just above its all-time high.

He said he expected the Dow to reach 100,000 by the time his term concludes, adding that he hoped the United States Supreme Court was observing developments.

He also pointed to an estimated 5.4% expansion in gross domestic product in the previous quarter, despite what he described as a record-long government shutdown driven by Democrats.According to his remarks, the shutdown was carried out under the banner of healthcare reform that ultimately did not materialise, with conservatives claiming it was intended as a political move against him.

The Washington Post's publisher and CEO Will Lewis resigned on Saturday, just days after laying off 300 journalists. His sudden departure comes amid strong criticism from staff over his handling of the newspaper's financial troubles and recent mass layoffs. Jeff D'Onofrio, the company's CFO, will take over as acting publisher and CEO immediately.Lewis announced his exit in a brief note to staff, thanking owner Jeff Bezos and claiming the ""difficult decisions"" were needed for the Post's future. “After two years of transformation at The Washington Post, now is the right time for me to step aside,” Lewis wrote Saturday in a brief note to staff. “I want to thank Jeff Bezos for his support and leadership throughout my tenure as CEO and Publisher. The institution could not have a better owner,"" he added.Further continuing his message he added, “During my tenure, difficult decisions have been taken in order to ensure the sustainable future of The Post so it can for many years ahead publish high-quality nonpartisan news to millions of customers each day.""However, Lewis' leadership came with controversies, according to CNN. Even during the Wednesday layoffs, his absence and subsequent appearance at a Super Bowl event in San Francisco reportedly caused anger.The Washington Post announced what it called a “significant restructuring” of its operations, including the closure of its standalone Sports desk and a reduction in its international reporting presence. According to Fox News, roughly a third of the organisation’s workforce which is nearly 300 employees were affected.Bezos broke his silence since the layoffs, stating in a statement that ""The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity."" He expressed confidence in the new leadership team of D'Onofrio, executive editor Matt Murray, and Opinion editor Adam O'Neal.Lewis's 15-month tenure was rocky from the start. He joined in November 2023 after working at The Wall Street Journal and within Rupert Murdoch's media empire. His reputation took hits when NPR reported his alleged involvement in covering up a phone-hacking scandal at Murdoch's UK tabloids, which he denied. He also reportedly tried to stop NPR from publishing that story.The Washington Post Guild responded to Lewis's departure with sharp criticism. ""His legacy will be the attempted destruction of a great American journalism institution,"" the union said, calling on Bezos to reverse the layoffs or sell the paper to someone willing to invest in its future.Despite attempts to improve the Post's business side and develop new revenue streams, Lewis struggled to win over the newsroom. His decision to fire executive editor Sally Buzbee and his handling of the recent layoffs, where he was notably absent from communicating with staff, further damaged his standing with employees.","The Washington Post's publisher and CEO Will Lewis resigned on Saturday.

How Trump's claims on tariffs are far from reality,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-trumps-claim-on-tariffs-are-far-from-reality/articleshow/128000245.cms,"Beyond Tariffs: The India–US Deal and the Politics of Oil

Here is what Trump claimed and how far were they from facts

""Just over one year ago, we were a ‘DEAD’ country. Now, we are the ‘HOTTEST” country anywhere in the world!""

US was not dead when he returned to the Oval office for his second stint for POTUS. Despite a shaky start of his second term, the economy has performed strongly overall.

In 2024, the last year of the Biden presidency, American gross domestic product grew 2.8%, adjusted for inflation, faster than any wealthy country in the world except Spain. It also expanded at a healthy rate from 2021 through 2023.

presidency, American gross domestic product grew 2.8%, adjusted for inflation, faster than any wealthy country in the world except Spain. It also expanded at a healthy rate from 2021 through 2023. Meanwhile, first three quarters show that Trump’s tariffs - or even the threat of them - produced mixed outcomes. However, Full-year data for 2025 is not yet available.

From January to March, US GDP contracted for the first time in three years. The reason was clear: imports surged as American companies rushed to stock up on foreign goods ahead of potential tariff hikes. Since imports are subtracted from GDP, the spike dragged growth into negative territory.

The slowdown proved temporary. Growth rebounded sharply in the second quarter, with the economy expanding at an annualised rate of 3.8% from April to June. Momentum strengthened further in the third quarter, when growth accelerated to 4.4%. The rebound was driven in part by a decline in imports, reflecting both the impact of tariffs and earlier stockpiling. Strong consumer spending also played a major role.

Trump has also pointed to gains in the US stock market, noting that stocks hit record highs 52 times in 2025. While the market did post solid gains, its performance lagged several global peers.

“Annual core inflation for the past three months has dropped to just 1.4% - far lower than almost anyone, other than me, had predicted.”

According to news agency AP, Trump is using cherry-picked data to vastly exaggerate where inflation stands. Trump’s preferred inflation figure - annual inflation over the past three months excluding food and energy - is low. But it is also distorted. A government shutdown in October and November disrupted data collection, forcing the statistical agency to rely on rough estimates in some categories, which artificially pushed overall inflation lower.

Core inflation over the final six months of 2025 stood at 2.6%. That is lower than January 2025 levels but roughly in line with October 2024. Overall inflation has largely plateaued this year. It was running at 3% in September, before the shutdown - the same level as in January 2025.

It is true that inflation did not spike as sharply as many economists feared when Trump began rolling out tariffs last spring. But that is partly because many of the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs were later withdrawn, scaled back or riddled with exemptions.

The impact of tariffs is clearer in core goods prices, which also exclude food and energy. Before the pandemic, core goods prices typically rose little or even fell year after year. By last December, however, they were 1.4% higher than a year earlier - the biggest increase outside the pandemic since 2011.

“The data shows that the burden, or ‘incidence,’ of the tariffs has fallen overwhelmingly on foreign producers and middlemen… paying at least 80% of tariff costs.”

The study Trump cited appears to show the opposite. Co-authored by Cavallo, it finds that US consumers bore about 43% of the tariff-related costs after seven months, with most of the remainder absorbed by US firms.

Cavallo said import prices barely declined, suggesting foreign exporters did not cut prices enough to shoulder most of the burden.

“We have slashed our monthly trade deficit by an astonishing 77%.”

This figure also relies on cherry-picking - comparing an unusually large deficit in January 2025, when Trump took office, with an unusually small one in October. The broader trend is less flattering.

From January through November 2025, the US ran a trade deficit of nearly $840 billion, about 4% higher than during the same period in 2024.

Imports surged in the first three months of the year as companies rushed to buy foreign goods ahead of tariffs.

While monthly deficits fell later in the year, the early import spike was so large that the year-to-date deficit still exceeds last year’s.

""I have successfully used tariffs to secure colossal investments in America… more than $18 trillion.”

Trump did use tariff threats to extract investment pledges from trading partners. The European Union alone promised $600 billion over four years.

But the administration has not explained how it arrived at the $18 trillion figure.

The White House has cited $9.6 trillion in public and private commitments. Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate the pledges at about $5 trillion from the EU, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE.

has cited $9.6 trillion in public and private commitments. Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate the pledges at about $5 trillion from the EU, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Gulf states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE. They also caution that many pledges are vague and may never fully materialise, in part because some countries would struggle to finance them.

The numbers are large by any measure. Total private investment in the US currently runs at about $5.4 trillion annually. In 2024, foreign direct investment - money put into factories, offices and other physical assets - totaled just $151 billion.

US President Donald Trump has, at several occasions, claimed that broad tariffs on different countries has revived the American economy. In his recent opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Trump claimed that tariffs have created an ""American economic miracle. ""He also lamented on critics and economists who predicted that tariffs would backfire, raising prices and threatening growth.""When I imposed historic tariffs on nearly all foreign countries last April, the critics said my policies would cause a global economic meltdown,"" US president wrote.""Instead, they have created an American economic miracle, and we are quickly building the greatest economy in the history of the world, with other countries doing just fine!"" he added.However, it appears the US president is playing fast and loose with his claims, which are often not supported by facts.","Despite a shaky start of his second term, the economy has performed strongly overall.

Iran’s IRGC ‘CAPTURE’ Two Foreign Oil Tankers, Send Message To Trump Ahead Of Iran-US Nuke Talks

The United States on Friday announced new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil and petrochemical trade, hours after indirect talks between Tehran and Washington concluded in Oman.The move came even as both sides signalled willingness to continue negotiations aimed at easing tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme.The sanctions, unveiled by the US State Department, target 15 entities and 14 vessels linked to Iran’s “shadow fleet,” which is used to transport petroleum, petroleum products and petrochemicals in violation of international restrictions, according to Reuters.In a statement, State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said that the measures were part of the Trump administration’s renewed pressure campaign against Tehran.“President Donald Trump is committed to driving down the Iranian regime's illicit oil and petrochemical exports under the administration's maximum pressure campaign,” Pigott said.The United States said that the fresh sanctions were aimed at cutting off revenue streams that Tehran uses to fund repression at home and destabilising activities abroad.Pigott accused Tehran of prioritising repression and regional destabilisation over domestic welfare.“Instead of investing in the welfare of its own people and crumbling infrastructure, the Iranian regime continues to fund destabilizing activities around the world and step up its repression inside Iran,” he said.Warning of continued pressure, he added: “So long as Iranian regime attempts to evade sanctions and generate oil and petrochemical revenues to fund such oppressive behavior and support terrorist activities and proxies, the United States will act to hold both the Iranian regime and its partners accountable.”Among the entities sanctioned by the United States is an India-based firm involved in managing a vessel accused of transporting Iranian petroleum products in violation of international restrictions.According to the US State Department, Elevate Marine Management Private Limited (ELEVATE), an Indian commercial shipping management company, served as the commercial manager of the BENEDICT, a Cameroon-flagged crude oil tanker. The vessel is alleged to have transported Iranian petroleum products on at least three occasions between September and November 2025.Akash Anant Shinde is an Indian national and director of Elevate Marine Management Private Limited.The announcement came shortly after Iranian and US officials wrapped up a day of indirect negotiations in Muscat, mediated by Oman. The talks were described as constructive by TehranIran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking after the talks, struck a cautiously optimistic tone, calling the discussions “a good start.”“If we can go along with this positive path, I can say that we can reach a positive framework regarding the nuclear talks between Iran and the US,” Araghchi told reporters.He said both sides had agreed to continue discussions after further consultations in their respective capitals.“Our concerns were conveyed, as well as our interests and the rights that the Iranian people have. It was conveyed in a very good atmosphere, and the views of the other side were also heard,” he added.According to Oman’s foreign ministry, foreign minister Badr al-Busaidi met separately with Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff in Muscat.Footage later released by Oman’s state news agency showed US Navy Admiral Brad Cooper, head of US Central Command also present.The negotiations mark the first formal engagement since the United States joined Israel’s military action against Iran in June, during which US strikes damaged Iranian nuclear facilities.Israel also targeted Iran’s air defence systems and ballistic missile infrastructure. Since then, Washington has bolstered its military presence in the region, deploying additional warships, fighter jets and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln.US officials have indicated that Washington wants the talks to go beyond Iran’s nuclear programme to include its missile capabilities and regional influence. Iran, however, has insisted that discussions remain limited.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged the difficulty of the negotiations earlier this week, saying, “I’m not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we’re going to try to find out.”Tensions remain high as both sides weigh diplomacy against the risk of escalation. The US has recently shot down an Iranian drone near the USS Abraham Lincoln, while Iran has attempted to stop a US-flagged vessel in the Strait of Hormuz.Friday’s sanctions also follow similar measures imposed last month, when the US targeted vessels accused of moving hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian oil.The Treasury Department has said that Iran’s shadow fleet plays a critical role in financing the regime, including its domestic crackdowns and regional activities.","The sanctions target 15 entities and 14 vessels linked to Iran’s ‘shadow fleet,’ which is used to transport petroleum, petroleum products and petrochemicals in violation of international restrictions.

AI spending worries hit Amazon

Bitcoin stabilises, crypto stocks jump

Consumers, airlines and smaller stocks gain

US stock markets moved higher on Friday, clawing back part of the heavy losses seen earlier in the week, as technology shares recovered and bitcoin halted its recent slide.The rebound came after several volatile sessions driven by worries over massive spending on artificial intelligence and its impact on corporate profits.The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent, marking only its second gain in the past eight sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 776 points, or 1.6 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent by mid-morning trading in New York.Chipmakers led the recovery. Nvidia climbed 4.9 per cent, trimming a weekly decline of more than 10 per cent, while Broadcom gained 3.8 per cent after falling sharply earlier in the week.According to news agency AP, hopes of strong long-term demand for chips linked to artificial intelligence continued to support the sector.Despite the broader rebound, concerns over soaring AI investment remained. Amazon shares slumped 8.5 per cent after the company said it expects to spend around $200 billion this year on areas such as AI, chips, robotics and low-earth-orbit satellites.Similar spending plans announced earlier by Alphabet have raised questions about whether such large investments will deliver enough future profits.As per news agency AFP, investors have grown cautious after a period when enthusiasm around AI lifted much of the technology sector.Chris Low of FHN Financial said markets were now reassessing whether the sell-off had gone too far, noting that traders felt some of the recent declines may have been “overdone”.Even with Friday’s gains, the S&P 500 was still on course for its third weekly fall in four weeks.Bitcoin showed signs of stabilising after weeks of losses that wiped out more than half its value since its October peak.The cryptocurrency recovered to around $68,000 after briefly slipping near $60,000 late on Thursday.The move helped lift shares linked to the crypto sector. Robinhood Markets surged 11.7 per cent, Coinbase Global rose 7.3 per cent, and Strategy, a company known for holding large amounts of bitcoin, jumped 15.9 per cent.US consumer sentiment also provided some support. A preliminary survey from the University of Michigan showed sentiment improving slightly, defying expectations of a fall. The improvement was strongest among households that own shares.Airline stocks gained on hopes that stronger confidence would translate into more travel spending. United Airlines rose 5.4 per cent, American Airlines gained 4.6 per cent, and Delta Air Lines added 4.4 per cent.Smaller companies outperformed larger peers, with the Russell 2000 index climbing 2.3 per cent. These firms tend to be more sensitive to the strength of the US economy.In the bond market, US Treasury yields were largely steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at around 4.21 per cent, unchanged from late Thursday.","The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent, marking only its second gain in the past eight sessions.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

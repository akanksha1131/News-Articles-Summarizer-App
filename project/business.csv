Index View: NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty consolidated in a 2000 points range in the last 6 sessions after the recent strong rally of 5500 points or 11% in the preceding 6 sessions underpinned by robust institutional accumulation in frontline banking counters and a notable revival in FII inflows—reflecting a clear risk-on undertone. Rate cut hopes and positive result of the large cap private Banks boosted sentiment.

A sustained move above the recent high of 56,098 could trigger further upside toward the 56,800 levels in the coming sessions. However, if the index fails to surpass this level, the index is likely to extend the last 6 sessions consolidation within the 54,000–56,000 range, helping to ease the overbought conditions created by the recent sharp rally.

On the downside, key support is seen between 54,000-53,500, which corresponds to the gap-up region and the previous significant breakout zone.

Volatility is expected to stay elevated due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, developments related to tariffs, and the unfolding Q4 earnings season.

ITR filing FY 2024-25: New ITR-1 form notified with major changes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2024-25-new-itr-1-form-notified-with-major-changes-heres-what-taxpayers-should-know/articleshow/120785747.cms,"ITR filing: For individuals and those not requiring account audits, the submission deadline remains July 31.

ITR-1 for income tax return FY 2024-25:

Salaried individuals and those under the presumptive taxation scheme can now file ITR-1 and ITR-4 respectively if their long-term capital gains (LTCG) are within Rs 1.25 lakh per fiscal year. Previously, these categories were required to file ITR-2.

According to I-T regulations, LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh from listed shares and mutual funds remains tax-exempt. Any gains above Rs 1.25 lakh annually attract a 12.5 per cent tax.

Similar to the previous version, ITR-1 requires individuals to provide information about foreign travel expenses surpassing Rs 2 lakh for themselves or others.

Additionally, it requires disclosure of electricity consumption costs exceeding Rs 1 lakh during the previous fiscal period.

What does the new ITR-1 mean for taxpayers?

New ITR forms for FY 2024-25: The Income Tax Department has issued a new ITR-1 and ITR-4 for tax filing purposes for the assessment year 2025-26, simplifying the process for individuals with long term capital gains up to Rs 1.25 lakh from listed equities.The forms include modifications regarding deductions under sections 80C, 80GG and others, featuring a drop down menu in the utility. Additionally, taxpayers must provide detailed section-wise information for TDS deductions.Tax filing can commence once the I-T department releases the utility for the 2024-25 fiscal year. For individuals and those not requiring account audits, the submission deadline remains July 31.Typically, ITR forms are released before the fiscal year ends, around February/March. This year's delay in form notification and filing utility occurred because revenue department officials were engaged with the new Income Tax Bill, presented to Parliament in February.Also Check | Latest income tax slabs FY 2025-26: What are the new income tax slabs, rates after Budget 2025 announcements? Check new vs old tax regime comparison - FAQs answered ITR Form 1 Sahaj is available for resident individuals with yearly earnings up to Rs 50 lakh, receiving income through salary, single property ownership, additional sources (interest) and farming revenue not exceeding Rs 5,000 annually.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India told TOI, “As per the new forms notified for FY 2024-25, salaried individuals and individuals under presumptive taxation, can now use the simplified ITR-1 and ITR-4 respectively, if they only have long-term capital gains (LTCG) from sale of listed equity shares/ mutual funds, which are within the tax-exempted limit of INR 1.25 lakh per annum, assuming all other conditions are satisfied. Earlier, for any capital gains, the taxpayers were mandatorily required to file ITR-2/ITR-3 etc. as applicable”“Further, the new ITR-1/ ITR-4 forms, require the taxpayer to only report the total sales consideration, cost and amount of LTCG, as against the detailed disclosures required In Form ITR-2, ITR-3 etc., even though the LTCG within this limit is not taxable. This is a welcome measure towards simplifying tax compliance and reporting by taxpayers within this category,” she said.According to Samir Kanabar, Tax Partner at EY India, this move reflects a clear shift towards enhancing taxpayer services by allowing individual taxpayers to file simplified tax return where they have long-term capital gains up to Rs 1.25 lacs.“Thereby, it removes the burden of navigating more complex forms. The change is expected to encourage greater voluntary compliance, reduce filing-related stress, and make the system more inclusive and user-friendly for small taxpayers. We hope that this is just the beginning towards better compliance and simplification and expect more to come,” he said.“Forms ITR-1 and ITR-4 for Assessment Year 2025-26 remain largely consistent with the previous year. Notably, the updated forms bring relief to individuals with long-term capital gains taxable under Section 112A of the Income Tax Act provided these gains do not exceed the threshold of ₹1.25 lakhs, as earlier such taxpayers had to file return in ITR 2/ITR 3, which are more detailed forms. This is a welcome move by the Government and marks a positive step toward improving taxpayer services by allowing individuals within this category to file a simplified return which was not allowed till last year,” says Divya Baweja, Partner, Deloitte India.Sandeep Jhunjhunwala, Tax Partner at Nangia Andersen LLP stated that previously, salaried individuals with capital gains income needed to file ITR-2, even when these gains were exempt under Section 112A's threshold limit, necessitating comprehensive disclosures including capital gain accrual or receipt information and securities details.Also Read | Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime The new ITR-1 form for AY 2025-26 has been modified to include a dedicated portion for reporting LTCG income that is tax-exempt within the limits specified under Section 112A, thus reducing filing complications.""However, in cases, where the taxpayer earns LTCG under Section 112A in excess of Rs 125,000 or where the taxpayer earns any other LTCG other than that taxable under Section 112A or earns short term capital gains or has carried forward or brought forward capital losses or derived income from any combination of the above, the salaried individual would have to resort to Form ITR-2 for filing return of income,"" Jhunjhunwala said.","ITR-1 for income tax return FY 2024-25: Salaried individuals and those under the presumptive taxation scheme can now file ITR-1.

Smartphones and tablets will be the first two electronic consumer items to be brought under the ' Repairability Index ' regime.The 'repairability index' is a label that manufacturers put on electrical and electronic equipment to inform consumers about the repairability of the entire product or its components. The index rates products on six core parameters - disassembly depth; repair information; availability of spare parts within a reasonable timeline; software updates; tools; and fasteners (types and availability).A govt-appointed committee has recommended to the consumer affairs department a self-declared 'Repairability Index' by original manufacturers for these products to enable customers to make informed choices. The manufacturers will have to rate the devices on this index upfront so that consumers get full information, as per suggestions of the panel.As per the complaints lodged with National Consumer Helpline (NCH), a large number of consumers face issues while seeking repair for their mobile phone and tablets. The number of such complaints has increased from 19,057 in 2022-23 to 21,020 in 2023-24 and to 22,864 in 2024-25.The govt panel has also suggested that the index should be displayed at the point of sale/ purchase, e-commerce platforms and in the form of QR code on packaged products.In an official statement, the consumer affairs department said that the committee constituted for the Framework on Repairability Index in mobile and electronic sector has submitted its report.

NEW DELHI: Govt has told industry that current discussions for the proposed trade deal with the US are focusing on products or tariffs lines, and has sensitised it about the possible rules of origin that will determine if an item qualifies for duty concessions or not.During a meeting on Friday, businesses were also asked to be prepared for reciprocal tariffs in some form after the current pause ends in early July.At a meeting with industry on Friday, the commerce department sought a detailed list of non-tariff barriers faced by Indian exporters , which it can take up during negotiations with the United States.India's expectations from the negotiations were not shared with industry representatives, nor were their inputs sought on how to go about sector-specific talks. The meeting, however, marks the first set of consultations with industry amid criticism that India Inc has been kept in the dark about the talks.The key focus was on rules of origin. As per indications, the final rules of origin are likely to be discussed after the product outlines of the deal are decided, sources said. During the meeting with industry representatives, a team of officials led by India's chief negotiator Rajesh Agrawal pointed out that these norms may be different from what Indian players are used to.The US goes by case laws and the norms under the trade deals with Canada and Mexico as well as Japan, that were shared during the meeting, were very different from each other. For instance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has a specific set of rules for farm goods, which are applicable to all sides. But when it comes to Japan, it requires a change in tariff sub-heading for spices, while the US insists on it for tea and spices. Similarly, automobiles, textiles and apparel have product specific rules under USMCA, but that does not exist under the US treaty with Japan.Indian industry has been asked to formulate its strategy according to the norms in the US, where change in form, appearance, nature and character of a product is what is insisted upon. In contrast, India's agreements have focused on a certain amount of value addition and changes in product classification.","The commerce department sought a detailed list of non-tariff barriers faced by Indian exporters.

These transactions were concealed and not reported as related party transactions in the company’s financial statements, violating several regulatory norms.The regulator levied a Rs 28 crore fine each on Ashok Ghanshyamdas Rajani (Chairman and Managing Director) and Amrit Rajani (CFO), Rs 2 crore on Executive Director Asit Kumar Bhowmik, and Rs 50 lakh on Executive Director Sivaprasada Rao Buddi.Sebi said Seya Industries also falsified its financial records for FY19 and FY20 through fictitious sales and purchases, in violation of the Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices (PFUTP) rules and disclosure obligations.Further, Sebi highlighted that the company’s accounting for interest in FY20 through FY22 and the quarters ending June, September, and December 2022, was not compliant with Indian Accounting Standards.Despite these findings, Sebi clarified that no punitive action is currently being taken against the company itself due to the ongoing insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The regulator said it will address the case against the company in a separate order.Sebi observed that Ashok Rajani, being at the helm of Seya Industries, was deeply involved in the day-to-day operations and personally signed off on misleading financial statements for four consecutive fiscal years. His son, Amrit Rajani, was held equally responsible for overseeing financial irregularities.“I note that Amrit Rajani, being CFO of the company and looking after the day-to-day affairs of the company, was a KMP of the company at the relevant time and thus, is responsible for the violations committed by the company,” Sebi Whole-Time Member Ananth Narayan G said in the order.Executive Directors Bhowmik and Buddi, tasked with ensuring compliance and accurate financial reporting, were found to have failed in their responsibilities, damaging investor trust in the securities market. Both were found to have violated insider trading, PFUTP, and disclosure rules.All four individuals — Ashok Rajani, Amrit Rajani, Bhowmik, and Buddi — have been barred from accessing the securities markets for five years. They are also prohibited from holding positions as directors or key managerial personnel (KMP) in any listed company or Sebi-registered intermediary for the same duration.Additionally, Sebi has directed Amrit Rajani to ensure that the Rs 81.26 crore siphoned off through promoter-linked entities is returned to Seya Industries within six months, along with 12% annual interest from the date of diversion.The action follows complaints filed between 2020 and 2021 by SC India Fund Manager, which accused the company of raising funds through private placement based on inflated financial statements. After Seya failed to cooperate with the National Stock Exchange (NSE), Sebi appointed Ernst & Young in September 2021 to conduct a forensic audit. The investigation focused on the financial years ending March 2019, 2020, and 2021.","Sebi found that Seya Industries diverted Rs 81.26 crore to companies linked to the promoter family.

The official claimed that Pakistani dried fruits, salt, and leather products are being transported to India through Sri Lanka.Given the likelihood of $500 million worth of exports reaching India through alternative routes, the official emphasised the necessity to implement a complete prohibition on Pakistani exports to India , whether direct or indirect, and to monitor and identify goods that might enter through origin manipulation. ""This comprehensive ban imposed by India including a ban on indirect exports would enable the customs authorities to prevent Pakistan exports from entering India through circumvention,"" the official added.This report comes as the central government imposed a ban on trade with Pakistan amid escalating tension after the Pahalgam terrorist attack on April 22, that resulted in 26 fatalities. ""India's already minuscule imports from Pakistan--barely $ 0.5 million a year--will now drop to zero. No one in India will miss anything except perhaps Himalayan pink salt (Sendha Namak), extracted from salt deposits of Pakistan,"" said Ajay Srivastava, Founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), in a recent statement.This also comes against the backdrop of long-standing trade restrictions. Following the Pulwama attack in 2019, India had imposed 200 per cent tariffs on Pakistani goods. As a result, direct trade between April 2024 and January 2025 dwindled to just $ 0.42 million, restricted mostly to niche items like figs ($ 78,000), basil and rosemary herbs ($ 18,856), and Himalayan pink salt.The Indian High Commission in Islamabad's official records indicate that India procured various items from Pakistan, including copper, edible fruits and nuts, cotton, salt, sulphur, organic chemicals, mineral fuels, plastics, wool, glassware and raw hides.Conversely, India's exports to Pakistan encompassed diverse products, comprising cotton, organic chemicals, food products, animal fodder, edible vegetables, plastic articles, man-made filament, coffee, tea, spices, dyes, oil seeds, dairy products and pharmaceutical items.Read more: India’s imports from Pakistan set to log zero from $0.5 million after complete ban, says GTRI","Pakistani exports are reportedly entering India via intermediary nations such as the UAE, Singapore, Indonesia and Sri Lanka.

Fallout at Kohl’s

What’s next for Holt?

Chandra Holt, once considered one of the most promising executives in American retail, is now at the center of a corporate scandal involving her former Walmart colleague, and reported former romantic partner, Ashley Buchanan .Buchanan was fired this week as CEO of Kohl’s after the company accused him of engineering a vendor deal riddled with “undisclosed conflicts of interest.”According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Buchanan directed Kohl’s to enter into a multimillion-dollar contract with a vendor that allegedly had “highly suspicious” and “favorable” terms. The filing did not name the vendor or the individual involved, but The Wall Street Journal identified the woman as Chandra Holt.In a statement to The Journal, Holt confirmed she had known Buchanan for a decade but denied any business wrongdoing. “I’ve known Ashley Buchanan for 10 years, but I have not received any compensation for my Incredibrew business from Kohl’s,” she said.Holt is the founder and CEO of Incredibrew, a coffee brand she launched in 2022 that claims to infuse beverages with vitamins and minerals. It remains unclear whether Incredibrew was the vendor involved in the Kohl’s deal under scrutiny.Buchanan and Holt first crossed paths at Walmart, where they worked closely before departing around the same time for other executive roles. Buchanan left in early 2020 to head arts-and-crafts giant Michaels, while Holt exited in 2021 to become CEO of Conn’s HomePlus.Most recently, she served as CEO of Beyond, Inc, the parent company of Overstock.com and Bed Bath & Beyond, between February 2024 and June 2024.Her impressive résumé includes leadership stints at Target, Sam’s Club, and Walgreens. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in advertising, PR, and communications from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and an MBA in strategy and marketing from the Carlson School of Management.Buchanan’s exit comes amid a challenging period for Kohl’s. The company reported a 7.2% drop in annual sales to $15.4 billion and announced plans to close more than two dozen underperforming stores. The firing triggered serious consequences: Buchanan must now forfeit all equity awards granted during his tenure and repay a prorated portion of his $2.5 million signing bonus.While Kohl’s emphasized that the CEO's termination had “no bearing on the company’s financial performance,” the incident adds turbulence to a company already struggling with leadership instability . Buchanan was the third CEO in as many years, following short-lived tenures by Tom Kingsbury and Michelle Gass.Although no formal allegations have been made against Holt, her name is now linked to a boardroom controversy that could complicate her professional path. With her leadership record and entrepreneurial success through Incredibrew, the coming months may determine whether Holt can distance herself from the scandal or whether her past with Buchanan will cast a longer shadow.","Ashley Buchanan was fired this week as CEO of Kohl’s after the company accused him of engineering a vendor deal riddled with “undisclosed conflicts of interest” Buchanan directed Kohl's to enter into a multimillion-dollar contract with a vendor that allegedly had “highly suspicious” and “favorable” terms.

Legendary investor Warren Buffett cautioned against weaponizing trade policies , criticizing former President Donald Trump 's tariff strategy, as he addressed thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders at the company’s much-anticipated annual meeting on Saturday.“It’s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don’t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,” Buffett said early in the session, setting the tone for what many consider a closely watched commentary on global economic trends and US policy.While expressing support for balanced trade, Buffett made clear that he disagrees with the aggressive imposition of tariffs . “We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,” he said.Tariffs dominated the pre-submitted questions to Buffett and his top lieutenants — questions delivered via a CNBC journalist moderating the event. But shareholders were just as eager to hear Buffett explain why Berkshire is holding an enormous $347.7 billion in cash reserves, up from $334.2 billion at the end of last year.Buffett explained that attractive investment opportunities are scarce at the moment.“I just don’t see many attractively priced investments that I understand these days,” he said, though he added optimistically, “One day Berkshire will be bombarded with opportunities that we will be glad we have the cash for.”Among the tens of thousands of attendees, many had deeply personal reasons for being present. Haibo Liu, who traveled from China, camped outside the arena overnight to ensure a front-row seat. “He has helped me a lot,” Liu told news agency AP. “I really want to express my thanks to him.” Liu noted his concern that this could be Buffett’s final meeting, given the investor’s age of 94.Each year, roughly 40,000 people descend on Omaha to hear Buffett’s reflections — a crowd that includes major investors, fans, and even political figures. This year, Hillary Rodham Clinton was in attendance. Buffett, who once publicly supported her presidential bid, has since distanced himself from political endorsements to avoid business conflicts.Linda Smith, a 73-year-old longtime shareholder, traced her connection to Buffett back to a room she rented from his sister Doris while studying in Washington, D.C. “She came back from a meeting and said I had to buy the stock,” Smith recalled. At the time, a single Berkshire Hathaway share cost $3,400 — the same as her annual income — but she began saving after graduation. Today, that same share trades at an eye-watering $809,350.Smith estimates she has attended around 20 shareholder meetings. “I really like to listen to Warren Buffett — particularly this year with everything that has happened,” she said.The annual meeting, dubbed “Woodstock for Capitalists,” continues to draw global interest, as shareholders seek Buffett’s wisdom not just on investments, but on America’s place in a rapidly changing world economy.","Buffett addressed thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders at the company’s much-anticipated annual meeting on Saturday.

US travel sector may lose billions in major slowdown as Donald Trump’s tariff policies hit tourism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-travel-sector-may-lose-billions-in-major-slowdown-as-donald-trumps-tariff-policies-hit-tourism/articleshow/120845915.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

US travel sector faces major slowdown as Donald Trump’s tariff policies hit tourism, consumer sentimentThe US economy may lose tens of billions of dollars in 2025 as weakening travel demand, driven by declining international tourism and softer domestic spending, casts a shadow over the services sector, reported Reuters.Analysts warn that US President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies and tariff-driven uncertainty are eroding global sentiment and hurting travel-related industries.Foreign travel spending alone is projected to trim 0.1% from US GDP this year, with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan estimating the impact could rise to between 0.2% and 0.3%.Given the first-quarter GDP figure of $23.53 trillion, as per LSEG data, this translates to a potential loss of $23 billion to $71 billion, as per Reuters.“Anti-American sentiment could be driving a decline in international tourism, which is considered a service export,” JP Morgan said in a recent note, citing falling overseas visits to the US as global travellers turn away from American destinations.The downturn in travel sentiment has also been reflected in corporate outlooks. Delta Air Lines recently abandoned its full-year forecast, noting that international travel demand had “largely stalled.”Several major carriers, Southwest, American, Alaska Air, and Frontier, have all pulled their guidance, while United Airlines issued two separate forecasts amid growing trade-related uncertainty.The industry hasn't faced this level of unpredictability since the Covid-19 pandemic.Airbnb forecasted a second-quarter revenue below Wall Street expectations, and Hilton said many travellers remain in a “wait-and-see” mode. According to Goldman Sachs, “Tariff announcements and a more aggressive stance toward historical allies have hurt global opinions about the United States… The bigger issue is a pullback in tourist visits to the US.”Consumer behaviour domestically also signals a retreat from discretionary spending. Household budgets remain under pressure, with fears of a recession prompting Americans to cut back. Bank of America-aggregated card data showed a noticeable slowdown in spending on lodging, tourism, and airlines through the week ending March 22.According to JP Morgan, foreign visitor spending contributed $215 billion or 0.7% to US GDP in 2024. A 10% decline in that spending would equate to a direct seven-basis-point hit to GDP, it noted.The broader travel and tourism sector, which made up 3% of GDP and supported over six million jobs in 2023, is now confronting its weakest start to the year in recent times. Earlier this week, official data showed that the US economy contracted in Q1 2025 for the first time in three years, further underscoring the fragile state of consumer confidence.","US travel sector faces major slowdown as Donald Trump’s tariff policies hit tourism, consumer sentiment.

Buffett’s $325 billion cash pile raises eyebrows

“Real assets go on sale”

Wisdom from the wise

What now?

The bottom line

As markets wobble and mass layoffs ripple across industries, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has issued a stark warning: the world may be on the brink of a financial collapse bigger than the 2008 crisis.Kiyosaki, known for his bold predictions and unorthodox financial philosophy, believes the fear of unemployment is spreading like a virus—infecting the economy just as much as emotions. And he claims this fear may be the precursor to a “New Great Depression.”“I hope I’m wrong,” Kiyosaki said in a recent statement. “But if I’m right, I want people to be prepared, not panicked.”In his 2004 book Rich Dad’s Prophecy, Kiyosaki predicted a catastrophic market event triggered by an unstable retirement system and a ballooning global economy. That warning seemed prophetic when the 2008 Global Financial Crisis devastated markets. Now, he says, the next crash may already be underway—and it could dwarf the last one.“This recession may turn into a full-blown depression,” Kiyosaki warns. “But for those who are ready, it could be the opportunity of a lifetime.”Adding fuel to Kiyosaki’s fire is the recent news that Warren Buffett has sold billions in stocks and now holds $325 billion in cash—his largest war chest ever.While Buffett hasn’t revealed his plans, Kiyosaki sees it as a clear signal.“What do you think Buffett is prepared for?” he asked pointedly.Kiyosaki sees the cash stockpile as Buffett’s way of staying agile for the potential bargains that follow market crashes—a strategy Kiyosaki himself embraces.Far from advocating fear, Kiyosaki is calling for financial agility. He emphasizes the importance of acquiring real assets—such as gold, silver, oil, real estate, and even Bitcoin.“If Bitcoin were to crash back to $300 a coin… would you cry or celebrate?” he posed, challenging readers to view downturns as buying opportunities.To emphasize the importance of preparation, Kiyosaki quoted historic leaders:“Luck happens when preparation meets opportunity.” — Oprah Winfrey“Give me six hours to chop down a tree… I’ll spend the first four sharpening my axe.” — Abraham Lincoln“By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” — Benjamin Franklin“The will to win is important, but the will to prepare is vital.” — George PaternoKiyosaki's advice remains consistent: don’t panic—prepare. Whether through financial education, holding cash, or buying hard assets, he says the coming storm is survivable, and even profitable, for those who stay sharp.“Crashes aren’t disasters for the prepared. They’re discounts,” he wrote.With volatile markets, rising unemployment, and billionaire investors sitting on mountains of cash, the signs are hard to ignore. Whether Kiyosaki’s prediction plays out or not, one message rings clear: “Preparation beats panic. Every time.”","Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has issued a stark warning: the world may be on the brink of a financial collapse bigger than the 2008 crisis.

De minimis is a Latin term, which loosely translates to English as ""of the smallest"".The company began implementing import fees for US customers purchasing Chinese items last week, occasionally resulting in price increases exceeding double the original cost.This regulation has significantly affected international retailers, particularly Chinese online platforms like Shein and Temu, who are now subject to substantial duties.Recently, customers observed the removal of numerous Chinese products from Temu's website, leaving only items shipped from domestic warehouses.The company stated Friday that US consumer pricing ""remains unchanged as the platform transitions to a local fulfillment model .""""All sales in the US are now handled by locally based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country,"" the company spokesperson said in a statement.""Temu has been actively recruiting US sellers to join the platform. The move is designed to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses.

"After LNG, government may hike fertiliser imports from US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/after-lng-government-may-hike-fertiliser-imports-from-us/articleshow/120837154.cms,"NEW DELHI: After LNG , govt is exploring the possibility of increasing fertiliser imports from the US as it seeks to address US President Donald Trump 's concerns over the trade balance being in India's favour.The move will also help India reduce its dependence on countries, such as China and Russia, which are among the top sources of shipments. In fact, like oil, fertiliser imports from Russia shot up, following sanctions on Moscow in the wake of the Ukraine war. As a result, India's trade deficit with Russia grew manifold.India relies heavily on imported fertilisers, valued at $8.3 billion during the last financial year, with the US having a minuscule share, with the value of shipments pegged at $300,000. Last year, India had a trade surplus of over $41 billion with the US, while its goods imports were valued at $86.5 billion.While the proposed bilateral trade agreement with the US will focus on bridging the trade gap by lowering tariffs, govt is also looking at importing more American goods, including defence equipment and oil and gas.India is hoping that in return for items of America's interests, including automobiles, whiskey and farm goods, it will be able to get better access for its labour-intensive exports, such as leather and textiles products. Sixteenth Finance Commission chairman Arvind Panagariya said a deal with the US will put India ""incredibly favourably"", helping it attract investment and boost manufacturing, while flagging labour and land reforms.""India, itself, if it actually successfully negotiates a trade agreement with the US, will open a door a little wider to having an agreement with the EU and UK, that will place India in the global trade equation incredibly favourably,"" he said at an event organised by Isaac Centre for Public Policy .

NEW DELHI: India will be the primary manufacturing country for supplying iPhones to the US beginning June quarter as Apple , the world's biggest electronics seller, rejigs global sourcing locations to factor in the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs plans, especially on its biggest production hub China, CEO Tim Cook said on Friday.The move will see Taiwanese Foxconn and the Tata group, Apple's two contract manufacturers for iPhones in India, ramp up capacities as their factories will be used for supplies not only for the domestic need here, but also for the large American market, which is one of the company's biggest sales regions.Apple CEO Tim Cook said, ""For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin.""And while India takes charge of iPhones in America, Vietnam will be the ""country of origin"" for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods products also sold in the US, Cook added. This way, the company looks to dodge any debilitating tariffs impact on China and insulate itself from major retail price hikes in the US market.So, what happens to China and the vast manufacturing setup in the country? ""China would continue to be the country of origin for the vast majority of total product sales outside the US,"" the Apple CEO said, indicating that demand in 'rest of world' (beyond the US) will be met from there.But while Apple prepares India for a mega manufacturing push, the company also needs to factor in the fast-paced growth it is witnessing in the domestic market itself. India remains on the coveted list of countries where its volumes are creating quarterly records. ""We set a number of quarterly records in countries and regions across the world, including the UK, Spain, Finland, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, Poland, India, and the Philippines,"" Cook said.He said Apple is closer to expanding its physical retail presence in India beyond the two company-owned stores it has in New Delhi and Mumbai. Cook said there will be ""new retail stores in India starting later this year"". Apple's reshuffling of manufacturing schedules comes in as the company tries to protect itself from tariffs shocks, especially in its biggest manufacturing base, China.Cook announced that tariffs could cost the company approximately $900 million in the current quarter. He said the situation is uncertain at this moment as it is yet not clear where the final tariffs on each country will end up, since the US administration has just started negotiations with each country and region. ""We are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs, as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter. ""Despite the challenges, Apple posted strong financial results with quarter revenue at $95.4 billion and profits of $24.8 billion, led by iPhone sales.","The move will see Taiwanese Foxconn and the Tata group, Apple's two contract manufacturers for iPhones in India, ramp up capacities.

"Donald Trump’s 2026 budget pushes spending cuts, expands national security focus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-2026-budget-pushes-spending-cuts-expands-national-security-focus/articleshow/120828677.cms,"Office of Management and Budget Director Russel Vought at White House (AP)

US President Donald Trump’s 2026 budget proposal outlines sweeping cuts to non-defence domestic spending, totalling $163 billion, while ramping up expenditures on national security, the White House announced Friday.The proposal targets diversity initiatives and climate change programs, reflecting the administration's political priorities. However, it notably omits detailed projections for income taxes, tariffs, or the federal deficit — a sign of the significant political and financial challenges Trump faces as he pledges tax cuts and debt repayment without harming economic growth, according to news agency AP.While presidential budgets are not binding, they serve as key indicators of an administration’s goals for the upcoming fiscal year. This marks Trump’s first budget since returning to the White House and underscores his second-term agenda alongside Republican efforts in Congress.Trump’s proposal comes amid a volatile economic environment triggered in part by his own tariff policies . The White House has imposed what could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases through tariffs, raising concerns among consumers, CEOs, and global leaders about the risk of an economic downturn.The top-line figures released by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), now led by Russell Vought — a key figure in Project 2025 — reflect a ""skinny"" version of the budget, with more specifics promised in the coming weeks. “Details soon,” Vought told a Cabinet meeting earlier this week.With the federal budget surpassing $7 trillion, deficits nearing $2 trillion annually, and interest payments on the national debt approaching $1 trillion, the US debt has ballooned to $36 trillion. Much of this stems from pandemic-related spending, tax code changes, and increasing costs tied to aging-related healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid.The 2026 proposal reflects prior cost-cutting actions by Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, now overseen by adviser Elon Musk, including a trimmed-down federal workforce. It may also preview new revenue sources, particularly from tariffs.Democrats are expected to fiercely oppose the plan, calling it a blueprint for slashing vital public programs. At the same time, congressional Republicans are working to draft Trump’s ""big, beautiful bill"" — a comprehensive legislative package combining tax cuts, spending reductions, and increased funding for mass deportations.House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has met with Trump multiple times this week, aims to pass the bill through the House by Memorial Day and forward it to the Senate. “We had a very productive and encouraging meeting at the White House this morning, and the remaining pieces of ‘The One, Big Beautiful Bill!’ are coming together very well,"" Johnson, R-La., said in a statement following Thursday’s meeting with Trump and key committee leaders.Still, divisions persist within the Republican ranks as they try to pass the bill over Democratic opposition. “We are awaiting some final calculations on a few of the tax components, and we expect to be able to complete that work on a very aggressive schedule,” Johnson added.Cabinet officials are now preparing to testify before Congress on their respective budget requests, with Vought expected to appear in the coming weeks to defend the administration’s plan.A veteran of conservative fiscal policy, Vought previously served in the same role during Trump’s first term and authored a chapter in Project 2025 detailing a federal government overhaul. He is also preparing a $9 billion rescission package aimed at cutting current 2025 funding for the US Agency for International Development and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which includes PBS and NPR.On Thursday, Trump signed an executive order instructing federal agencies and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to halt funding for PBS and NPR — a move that aligns with the rescission package and signals more cuts could follow","US President Donald Trump’s 2026 budget proposal outlines sweeping cuts to non- defence domestic spending, totalling $163 billion.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country. CEA said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105332515,imgsize-39018,width-400,resizemode-4/105332515.jpg"
E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

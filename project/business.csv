"US, Japan seal ‘massive’ trade deal; Tokyo to invest $550 billion in America; key details of the pact",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-japan-seal-massive-trade-deal-tokyo-to-invest-550-billion-in-america-key-details-of-the-pact/articleshow/128488072.cms,"US President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a “MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan,” under which Tokyo will make a ""$550 BILLION commitment to invest in the United States of America. "" The White House unveiled three large-scale investment projects backed by Tokyo with a combined value of $36 billion, representing the first tranche under Japan’s $550 billion commitment to invest in the United States as part of the newly agreed trade arrangement. Under the trade deal, the US will slash tariffs on Japanese imports to 15%.The initiatives cover energy exports, power generation and advanced manufacturing, spread across Texas, Ohio and Georgia.Announcing the development on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said, ""Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched! Japan is now officially, and financially, moving forward with the FIRST set of Investments under its $550 BILLION Dollar Commitment to invest in the United States of America — part of our Historic Trade Deal to REVITALIZE the American Industrial Base, create HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of GREAT American Jobs, and strengthen our National and Economic Security like never before..""He added that the projects would focus on “Oil & Gas in the Great State of Texas, Power Generation in the Great State of Ohio, and Critical Minerals in the Great State of Georgia.”The announcement also includes a $33 billion natural gas-fired power plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said that the facility would generate 9.2 gigawatts of electricity annually, describing it as the largest natural gas-fired generating facility in US history. According to him, the output would be more than enough to power all homes in Ohio.The plant will be operated by SB Energy, a subsidiary of Japanese technology investor SoftBank Group. The additional capacity is expected to strengthen baseload supply at a time when electricity demand is rising quickly, driven by data centres supporting artificial intelligence applications, Reuters reported.Referring to the Ohio facility in his post, Trump wrote, ""The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS. The Gas Power Plant in Ohio (A State I won THREE TIMES!) will be the largest in History, the LNG Facility in the Gulf of America will drive Exports, and further our Country's Energy DOMINANCE, and our Critical Minerals Facility will end our FOOLISH dependance on Foreign Sources. ""A second major project involves Japan’s investment in the $2.1 billion Texas GulfLink deepwater crude oil export terminal off the Texas coast. The White House said the funding would support the development of the offshore facility.Lutnick, as cited by Reuters, stated, ""This project is expected to generate $20–30 billion annually in U.S. crude exports, secure export capacity for our refineries, and reinforce America’s position as the world’s leading energy supplier.""Texas GulfLink, being developed by Sentinel Midstream, confirmed its participation in the initiative and said it was ""honored to be a trusted partner with the US department of commerce and the government of Japan.""The third project will see the establishment of a synthetic industrial diamond manufacturing plant in Georgia, valued at around $600 million. Lutnick said the high-pressure facility would meet 100 per cent of US demand for synthetic diamond grit, a material used in advanced manufacturing and semiconductor production. The United States currently relies largely on China for such supplies.The White House said the plant would be operated by Element Six, an industrial diamond company and a unit of De Beers Group, the world’s largest diamond producer.It remains unclear how much of the total project costs will be financed directly by Japanese entities and under what specific conditions. Under an earlier US-Japan agreement, profits from such ventures were to be shared equally until Japan’s initial investment was recovered, after which the split would shift to 90-10 in favour of the United States.The announcements followed meetings last week between Lutnick and Japan’s economic and trade minister, Ryosei Akazawa. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Akazawa said that several issues were still unresolved before deals could be formally announced.","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a “MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan,” under which Tokyo will make a ""$550 BILLION commitment to invest in the United States of America"" The initiatives cover energy exports, power generation and advanced manufacturing, spread across Texas, Ohio and Georgia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128489369,imgsize-1167561,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-generated-image-used-only-for-representational-purpose.jpg"
Impact of GST rate cuts fading? FMCG prices rise up to 5%; what's fueling the latest hike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/impact-of-gst-rate-cuts-fading-fmcg-prices-rise-up-to-5-whats-fueling-the-latest-hike/articleshow/128495119.cms,"September’s GST cuts had helped keep prices steady for a while, but now, almost six months in, the phase is ending. India’s consumer goods makers now increasing prices by up to 5%, as rising commodity costs and weak rupee put pressure on margins. The impact is now visible in stores this quarter, with distributors saying that selected packs of everyday essentials, including detergents, hair oils, chocolates, noodles and breakfast cereals, are reaching shelves with higher price tags, according to ET.The latest round of increases come after a period of during which companies had swiftly passed on tax benefits after GST rates were lowered across multiple consumer categories. Firms had acted cautiously at the time to avoid scrutiny under antiprofiteering regulations. With that phase now behind them, companies are beginning to exercise pricing power once again.Mohit Malhotra, chief executive of Dabur India, told ET that the company, which makes Real juice and Vatika hair oil, is implementing a 2% price increase in the ongoing fourth quarter. The higher pricing, he added, will continue into the next year.“We had to postpone the price hikes due to the antiprofiteering issue,” he said.The pressure on margins has intensified amid rising commodity prices and sustained currency weakness. Crude oil prices have firmed up in recent weeks, lifting costs of related commodities such as sulphur and n-paraffins. Coconut oil prices have doubled over the past year. Meanwhile, the rupee has been sliding for several months, touching an all-time intraday low of Rs 92.02 against the dollar on January 30, affected by trade deficits and global imbalances. The depreciation has pushed up the cost of imported inputs.“A lot of ingredients in breakfast staples, such as oats and almonds, are imported... The depreciation of the rupee has significantly increased costs of imports,” said Aditya Bagri, group director at breakfast cereals, muesli and oats maker Bagrry’s. “We are exploring a marginal increase in prices this quarter on select packs,” the official further added.Home and personal care manufacturers are also grappling with higher raw material expenses, given their dependence on crude oil derivatives that influence the cost of commodities such as liquid paraffin and surfactants.“Home care price increases will be (seen) soon. Some (packs with increased price tags) are already going into the market, and some will follow,” Niranjan Gupta, chief financial officer at Hindustan Unilever, said during an investor call last week. The company is raising prices across its home care portfolio, including Surf Excel, Rin, Vim and Domex.At Tata Consumer Products, tea prices have also shown movement. “There was a small uptick on tea prices at the end of the (December) quarter,” managing director Sunil D’ Souza said after the third-quarter earnings. “But remember, January to early April…will determine opening prices then. We will be flexible on moving (prices) up or down depending on how the commodity fares when the season opens. We have already passed on most of the increases in this quarter. ”However, even with higher revenues, profitability remains under pressure. A report by financial services firm Systematix Group on Tuesday noted that while FMCG companies recorded 9% year-on-year revenue growth in the third quarter of FY26, margin expansion has been constrained.Average sales volumes rose 6% year-on-year, supported by GST-linked reductions in categories such as biscuits, noodles and snack foods, the report said.","India's consumer goods makers now increasing prices by up to 5%, as rising commodity costs and weak rupee put pressure on margins.

Gold price prediction today: When will gold rates resume upward bullish trend?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-india-where-is-gold-silver-rate-headed-on-february-18-2026-mcx-gold-futures-outlook/articleshow/128493292.cms,"Gold price prediction

today:

Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers is of the view that gold prices are likely to resume their upward trend in the long run. He takes a look at the top factors for gold prices in the coming days:

Gold ended the last week marginally on the upside as mixed signals emerged from US macro cues. This was due to softer January Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures, which reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could cut rates later this year.

The US Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% year-over-year (YoY) in January, slowing from 2.7% in December & coming in below the 2.5% forecast. On a monthly basis, consumer inflation moderated to 0.2%, down from 0.3% previously and under market expectations of 0.3%.

Meanwhile US Nonfarm Payrolls released last week increased by the most in over a year, while the Unemployment Rate unexpectedly declined, pointing to a stabilizing labor market. Overall mixed physical demand from India and China, profit-booking booking by ETF Investors & Strong US macroeconomic data continues to cap the upside in the current week.

Demand for precious metals in the country has been frenetic in recent months, prompting authorities in the retail hub of Shenzhen to issue a stark warning against “illegal gold-trading activities,” ranging from apps offering leverage to retail investors to online live streams promoting bullion sales

China Market holidays & profit booking moves to keep Bullion’s sentiment muted in the current week; Dip buying interest could again emerge from lower levels in coming weeks.

Gold Price Weekly View:

Spot Gold (CMP $4937/Oz): Range Bound with dips towards $4,790 – 4,750/Oz

Spot Silver (CMP $ 74.75/Oz): Could dip towards $ 68 – 70/oz in 1 – 2 weeks.

Gold prices have experienced a choppy trade after regaining its ground towards $ 5000 in February due to thin trading volumes as China & some other Asian markets remain closed for public holidays this week. Profit-taking after a previous 2.5% surge seen on Friday last week have also contributed to the decline.Market movements this week could remain influenced by the holidays in China & other Asian markets amid anticipation of future rate adjustments. Also Asian currencies like yen seen gains this week, could see yen's weakening trend persisting unless the Bank of Japan adopts a more aggressive rate policyTraders could also closely watch renewed nuclear negotiations between the US and Iran, along with US-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine, both set to resume later in Tuesday session. Any setbacks could sway risk appetite and safe-haven flows.Macro cues from US including US data on GDP & Personal consumption Expenditure (PCE) Inflation numbers combined with Fed meeting minutes scheduled today could continue to keep price direction range-bound in near term.Meanwhile on a longer term basis of 1 – 2 months, expectations remain for gold to resume its upward trend, as the drivers behind a multiyear rally still remain in place. This includes geopolitical tensions, questions over the Fed’s independence, and a broader shift away from traditional assets such as currencies and sovereign bonds which could drive gold towards $ 6000/Oz in second quarter of the year","Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers is of the view that gold prices are likely to resume their upward trend in the long run.

Nifty has ended above its previous day’s high for the past 3 consecutive days as well as now confirmed a breakout above its short-term consolidation zone of 25450 – 25750. The larger timeframe, weekly and monthly charts remained unscathed. Nifty is seen as a buy in dip candidate below 25650 for targets of 25890 / 25080. These are specifically short-term levels as the broader range remains within a 4% band for the past couple of months.Bank Nifty continued its outperformance, posting the highest closing ever on daily charts just after the highest ever closing seen on weekly charts on Friday and a fresh all time high daily closing for the past 3 consecutive days. Bank Nifty saw buying emerge from a similar broad range where it experienced demand a couple of times in the past 3 months. Bank Nifty as well posted an engulfing bullish pattern on Monday wherein it opened below its previous day's low, and closed above its previous day's high. Bank Nifty has completed initial target of 61500 of its breakout while now acts as a buy on dip candidate near 61150 for target of 61700 / 62000.Sona BLW Precision Forgings has formed a bullish pin bar while concluding a consolidation phase, suggesting a potential pole and flag breakout structure.Momentum bias remains upward with upside targets near 580. The recent swing low dated 6th February provides a logical technical stop loss level, maintaining favourable risk reward if price sustains above breakout zones.After reclaiming its 200 DMA earlier this month, PFC continues to show sustained buying momentum despite corporate developments/announcements. Consecutive closes above prior day highs and a fresh 7 day high indicate strengthening trend continuation. The breakout above an 18-month falling trendline toward the end of January supports a bullish structure likely to extend higher.Stock has held firmly above its 200 DMA for nearly two months while developing a compression pattern, indicating potential energy buildup. Early signs suggest a move toward downward sloping 18 month resistance near 280. Elevated volumes during the last trading hour yesterday reinforce participation, supporting a tactical buy view targeting approximately 7 to 8 percent upside.","Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research of Nuvama Professional Clients Group recommends top stocks to buy today.

BofA maintained its buy recommendation on Infosys with the target price at Rs 1,840. Analysts said there were several positives on positioning and net opportunity could be bigger but the path is still evolving. They also said that enterprise AI isn’t plug and play. Currently revenue from AI-first offerings stands at 5.5%, which is not too different from others that have disclosed the metric. Analysts also warned that the key risk with AI, as per the company, is less about opportunity and more about strategy and execution. They also believe the Anthropic partnerships signify the role of a services company in enterprise AI shift.UBS has a buy on ITC with the target price cut to Rs 395 from Rs 420. Analysts said their distributor checks indicated a range of imminent price hikes, which is now arriving. ITC's 84mm cigarettes are expected to be priced at Rs 24 per stick, up from Rs 17 earlier. This segment has seen the steepest tax increase. While on the other extreme, 64mm is expected to be priced Rs 7 per stick, from Rs 5.9 earlier. The pricing of 69mm Goldflake (a large volume driver, currently at Rs 9.5 per stick) is yet to be known.They expect it to be priced around Rs 12. It is clear that price hikes have been fully passed on in the premium cigarettes, while it is kept minimal in price sensitive segments of 69mm and 64mm. This pricing approach is likely to keep ITC's volume and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) impact to minimum.Goldman Sachs has initiated its coverage of LG Electronics with the target price at Rs 1,750. Analysts said the company is well-placed to grow faster than the industry in the near to medium term. This could come due to shifting income cohort mix and rising penetration leading to faster industry growth in the mid and premium products. Also due to the company’s consistent track record of innovation enabling it to sustain its premiumization trends. A third reason could be LG Electronics Inc’s ‘Global South’ strategy, which should enable it to improve exports while expanding its manufacturing in India. However, analysts warned that the rising competitive intensity in an increasing commodity price environment should keep margin expansion potential limited.Morgan Stanley has an underweight rating on Dabur with the target price at Rs 400. Analysts said Mohit Malhotra (currently Whole Time Director & CEO) has been re-designated as Whole Time Director & Global CEO, effective Feb 17, 2026. Herjit S Bhalla has been appointed as CEO - India Business, effective April 15, 2026 or such other date as may be mutually agreed. They said that Bhalla brings more than 25 years of experience across sales, marketing and general management roles.HSBC has a buy on Aurobindo Pharma with the target price raised to Rs 1,415. Analysts said the company received US FDA approval for Adquey (difamilast 1%), a non-steroid topical treatment for atopic dermatitis. They feel Adquey has potential to become a $250-300-million brand but Aurobindo Pharma needs to invest for specialist sales hires. Analysts also feel marketing execution will be the key for Adquey’s success in the US.","BofA maintained its buy recommendation on Infosys with the target price at Rs 1,840.

India's talent pipeline ecosystem already thriving, says Google CEO

New Delhi: Google Wednesday announced the ""America-India Connect"" initiative that will see it set up a subsea cable link connecting the country with the US, building upon its plan to invest $15 billion in a data centre and strengthening the technical ties between the world's largest search engine giant and the country with the most internet users.""AI is the biggest platform shift of our lifetimes,"" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said at a media briefing, calling it ""one of the most powerful tools to solve problems and improve lives at planetary scale"". Pichai announced the plan after meeting PM Modi on Wednesday afternoon.At the heart of that bet is infrastructure. Pichai reiterated Google's previously announced $15 billion AI hub in Visakhapatnam, which will house gigawatt-scale compute capacity and a new international subsea cable gateway.""It's an extraordinary moment; we are investing to meet the moment,"" said Pichai, who is among top global tech chiefs in the capital for the AI Impact Summit.Google is among the world's largest private investors in subsea fibre-optic cable networks. The new link connects India and the US with the Southern Hemisphere. Partnering with specialist companies, it typically finances, designs and initiates these projects, which span thousands of kilometres under the sea and carry high-capacity global data traffic.The strategy reflects Google's view that India is uniquely positioned in the AI era. Pichai said he sees ""a chance to play a big role in all three"" -- as a user, builder and rule-shaper of AI systems.He described India as a ""full stack"" AI opportunity. That means investing in research institutions, infrastructure and diffusion across sectors so that AI touches daily life. ""The progress is about diffusing the technology,"" he said, adding that it must reach farmers, students and doctors.In this context, diffusion means how widely and deeply Artificial Intelligence spreads across the economy and society, beyond labs, pilot projects and large corporations.The company also announced a $30-million effort from its philanthropic arm, Google.org, to improve public services with AI, along with another $30 million to support researchers using AI for scientific breakthroughs.On corporate hesitation around AI spending, Pichai drew a historical parallel. Investments today, he said, resemble railroad and national highway projects, capital intensive but transformative. ""We are investing to meet that moment,"" he said. Cloud backlog alone doubled year-on-year to $240 billion, underscoring technological demand.For India's talent pipeline, Google's CEO was clear. The ecosystem is already thriving.

AI tools to widen scope for IT cos: Parekh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ai-tools-to-widen-scope-for-it-cos-parekh/articleshow/128532573.cms,"Salil Parekh, CEO and MD, Infosys (File photo)

New Delhi: Infosys CEO Salil Parekh suggested that stock market investors may be misreading the impact of AI tools from companies like Anthropic, arguing that rather than shrinking opportunities for IT services firms, such technologies are likely to expand and reshape the demand for their capabilities.He said the tools can automate parts of software development, but that's only a slice of the enterprise technology lifecycle. Integrating the software into complex legacy systems, testing it, securing it, deploying it into production and maintaining it at scale are entirely different challenges, he said. Most large enterprises, he noted, operate in ""brownfield"" environments built over decades. Introducing AI into such landscapes requires orchestrating and integrating multiple elements, as also understanding the nuances of specific industries and companies-capabilities IT services firms have built over years of digital transformation work.The share prices of leading IT services companies have dropped by 15-20% since early this month when Anthropic announced a slew of new and enhanced AI tools.Parekh said AI is a $300-$400 billion opportunity for IT services companies by 2030-including in areas like helping enterprises with creating an AI strategy, getting their data ready for AI training, transforming their processes with AI, modernising their legacy systems, and ensuring the AI systems can be trusted.Clients, he said, are seeking Infosys' help in all of these areas.He said the world is heading into an era where the amount of software required would explode because of AI. That he said will also ensure the IT services workforce will continue to expand.Even as investors worry that tools like Anthropic and Cognition will reduce the need for large teams, Infosys is still hiring at scale. Parekh said the company is on track to add about 20,000 college graduates this year and hire a similar number next year. Net headcount has risen in the first three quarters as new work comes in.The shift, Parekh said, is not fewer jobs, but different skills. Even if AI tools lift engineering productivity many times over, he said demand could still rise faster than productivity, requiring more engineers. Infosys is betting on reskilling its employees. Parekh said that's what the company did even during the cloud and digital transformation years. Thousands of employees are already being certified on AI tools, platforms and delivery methods.He also pushed back against the idea that AI makes learning computing and programming fundamentals optional. Freshers at Infosys, he said, are still trained to programme without AI tools first. Only then are they given AI copilots and agents. ""If you cannot write code yourself, you cannot assess whether the machine's output is correct,"" he said.The most valuable talent in the AI era, he said, will blend strong engineering with deep domain understanding. AI agents, he said, can automate tasks, but they struggle with industry nuance. However, he acknowledged that AI tools would raise expectations of clients, who will now demand faster delivery, tighter integration and measurable impact.","Parekh: AI is a $300-$400 billion opportunity for IT services companies by 2030. Infosys is on track to add about 20,000 college graduates this year and hire a similar number next year.

New Delhi: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has set up a special group within its Financial Reporting Review Board to fast-track high-profile cases, the regulatory agency's president Prasanna Kumar D said.""... more than 10 to 15 cases are there which have public interest.

It will take another two months and we will be able to give our findings,"" he said on Wednesday.Among the prominent matters under review are cases relating to Gensol Engineering and IndusInd Bank, which got into regulatory trouble last year after financial fraud concerns.He said that the earlier six-month timeline indicated by ICAI could not be met due to technical reasons and that once the review process is completed in 2 months, serious lapses, if found, will lead to disciplinary proceedings, while routine or procedural shortcomings may result in advisories instead of escalation.Kumar also spoke on the growing role of chartered accountants in Global Capability Centres (GCCs). ""Chartered accountants have a particularly important role because most services exported through GCCs are finance-related,"" he said.ICAI, which has a presence in 47 countries, is encouraging members to build international linkages and export services from India, through training programmes and local language training in countries like Japan and Germany. Kumar also said ICAI has introduced 11 Information Systems Audit Standards to strengthen digital audits. The standards will be effective Feb 2026 with a six-month recommendatory period.","ICAI has set up a special group within its Financial Reporting Review Board to fast-track high-profile cases.

Sarvam Kaze: Sarvam rolls out 105-bn parameter AI LLM model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sarvam-rolls-out-105-bn-parameter-ai-llm-model/articleshow/128532374.cms,"Sarvam AI showcases futuristic solutions tailor made for India's needs

New Delhi: In a major step for India's push to compete in advanced AI, homegrown startup Sarvam has launched a foundational 105-billion-parameter large language model (LLM), along with a range of tools and systems aimed at commercialisation.The company said the model performs on par with other open and closed models of similar size, including in agentic and tool-calling capabilities. Co-founder Pratyush Kumar said the model outperformed the 600-billion-parameter Deepseek R1 model released last year and Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash on Indian language technical benchmarks.Kumar said this demonstrates that India can build state-of-the-art AI models from scratch. He added that Sarvam chose the model's size carefully based on real-world use cases, and expects performance to further improve over time.In LLMs, ""parameters"" are numerical weights that represent the model's learned knowledge and capabilities. For comparison, leading global models from companies like OpenAI are reportedly built with trillions of parameters.Sarvam was among the first AI startups selected under the India AI Mission last April to develop sovereign AI models.

'Cautious optimism, governance is key'

New Delhi: Artificial general intelligence (AGI) could be years away, but its profound impact in the coming decade will be defined by scientific breakthroughs, not job extinction, Google DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis said at the India AI Impact Summit.""We're at a threshold moment where AGI... is on the horizon, maybe in the next five to ten years,"" said Hassabis. Yet he cautioned: ""No, I don't think we're there yet.""For India, Hassabis suggested applying AI deeply in areas of existing strength, from agriculture to creative industries, and urged young people to become fluent in AI tools, which could make them ""almost superpowered.""He also set a high bar for AGI. A true system must exhibit all human cognitive capabilities, across creativity, long-term planning and consistent reasoning across tasks. Today's models, he said, remain ""very impressive"" but flawed. These models cannot continually learn once deployed and struggle with long-term coherent plans and struggle with simple tasks.The nearer-term shift, he argued, lies in science. ""The reason I spent my whole life and career working on AI is I saw it... as maybe the ultimate tool for science,"" he said. Much of research involves detecting patterns in vast datasets, a task well suited to AI systems.He pointed to AlphaFold, Google DeepMind's protein structure prediction system, as evidence that AI can ""massively speed up our research and accelerate scientific discovery across almost any subject area."" Over the next decade, he expects a ""new golden era for scientific discovery.""Humans, he stressed, remain central. ""The next phase is going to be incredible... for human experts and scientists,"" particularly in cross-disciplinary work. Fully autonomous ""co-scientists"" remain more than a decade away.""In AI systems today, it's the human using it, putting in the energy and the question. Even in science, we have to supply the hypothesis and what the right research question is and then these tools help us get to those answers more quickly,"" the Nobel prize awardee explained.Still, AI is ""dual purpose,"" he warned.

New Delhi: Nearly 50% of ServiceNow's global R&D is based in India, making the country central to its innovation strategy, according to president and chief product officer Amit Zavery. Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit 2026, he said the Hyderabad and Bengaluru centres form the company's largest footprint outside the US.ServiceNow employs around 6,000 people in India-roughly one in five engineers globally-and its India Technology & Business Center has grown at a 25% CAGR over the past three years. India plays a pivotal role, driving core development across the AI platform, security, CRM (customer relationship management), and emerging capabilities while advancing conversational interfaces and user experience.ServiceNow, which commands a market capitalisation of over $111 billion and about $13 billion in annual revenue, recently witnessed a stock sell-off amid investor concerns that large language models could disrupt its business model and weigh on future growth and margins. Despite market anxiety about AI disrupting software firms, Zavery remains unfazed.""Markets often overreact to short-term signals, but they rarely reflect long-term potential. AI is transformational-like the internet or the cloud-and there will be winners and laggards."" Integration, he added, is key. ""We combine AI, data, workflow, and security into a single platform-something no other company offers at this scale,"" as ServiceNow pushes into an addressable market exceeding $600 billion.ServiceNow, he said, should be viewed as a platform company rather than a traditional SaaS provider.

India readies Asia’s biggest AI cluster

New Delhi: India is set to host one of Asia's largest AI superclusters, with Yotta Data Services unveiling plans to deploy more than 20,000 Nvidia Blackwell Ultra GPUs in a $2 billion investment. The facility is expected to go live by Aug 2026. The infrastructure, to be housed at Yotta's Greater Noida hyperscale campus and supported by its Navi Mumbai operations, marks a significant escalation in the country's AI compute ambitions.For Sunil Gupta, co-founder & CEO of Yotta, the bet on scale is rooted in a structural shift in demand. He told TOI that India's AI ecosystem has always had talent, data and startups, but lacked compute. That gap, he said, is something Yotta identified years ago as a potential bottleneck. Today, Yotta runs around 10,000 GPUs, with more being added, and Gupta argues the next phase will be even more compute-intensive.Much of the industry's attention has focused on training frontier models. Gupta, however, insists inferencing (where the trained model generates content, predictions and decisions) will ultimately require even larger volumes of infrastructure. As Indian-built models such as those serving agriculture, healthcare and education move into production and reach population scale, ""millions and billions of people will come concurrently"" to access them, he said, requiring ""thousands and thousands of GPUs purely for inferencing. ""Gupta suggested that India could serve large parts of the APAC region and Global South from its data centres. Yotta is in discussions with multiple countries exploring whether their AI capacity could be delivered from India.","India set to host one of Asia's largest AI superclusters.

Microsoft: 'Push investment while protecting sovereignty',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/push-investment-while-protecting-sovereignty/articleshow/128531878.cms,"Brad Smith (File photo)

Microsoft's report underscores a growing AI adoption divide between Global North and South. Beyond infra investments, what will it take for AI to help reduce inequalities?

Microsoft President Brad Smith

Where does India stand in this shift tied to the $50 billion Global South push?

Many firms advocate

sovereign tech stacks,

but can they truly be

sovereign if controlled by

a few firms and governed by US regulations?

How do you view India's

AI talent trajectory?

New Delhi: Microsoft president Brad Smith, in an interview, outlined the opportunities and responsibilities AI presents for the Global South, with a particular focus on India. He noted the need for digital sovereignty, and India-US collaboration through trade agreements to protect sovereignty while enabling cross-border innovation. Smith said India is Microsoft's second-largest employee base, with 24,000 employees. Excerpts:What the diffusion report shows is a rapidly emerging AI divide. Adoption in the Global North is about 25%, while the Global South is around 14%. India is slightly better at more than 15%, but still closer to the Global South. We should act with urgency because the greatest divide today is economic, partly created by unequal access to technology and electricity. We are spending $50 billion by the end of the decade bringing AI to the Global South, while prioritising skilling and measurement systems.India is among the best-positioned countries in the Global South, and in some ways, globally. Human talent remains the most precious natural resource, and software development talent is especially critical. AI is not diminishing that; if anything, it makes developers even more important. India has not just many engineers, but highly talented ones. That is why it is the second-largest country in the world in terms of Microsoft employees. The govt should invest in this opportunity, encourage AI adoption and foreign investment, while protecting digital sovereignty.We need balance. Advancing digital sovereignty is essential, and we are committed to it. Future India-US trade agreements should ensure reciprocity, keeping markets open while guaranteeing certainty of supply. Few countries are better positioned to achieve this. India's engineers must be able to build software for the US, just as American technology companies should bring innovation to India. By leaning together, both nations can create a new global model that protects sovereignty while enabling collaboration.Few countries match India's strengths, especially in software development talent. AI will change jobs, enhancing productivity, growing economies, and replacing some roles. Denying that would be naive. But existing roles can evolve for the better if leaders in technology, business, and govt act wisely. This is shaping up to be one of the defining economic stories of the next 25 years. Our North Star should use AI to create better jobs and brighter futures. Technology only affects people if we allow it to; leaders have both a responsibility and an opportunity to ensure it serves our people.","Microsoft president Brad Smith outlined the opportunities and responsibilities AI presents for the Global South, with a particular focus on India.

Shares of ITC Ltd , Godfrey Phillips India Ltd and VST Industries Ltd climbed by as much as 15%, following media reports that companies have implemented price hikes to pass on the impact of the recent excise duty increase to consumers. As of 1:15 pm, Godfrey Phillips India Ltd was trading at 2,386, up 318 points or 15.4%. At the same time, ITC gained 2% to 331 while VST Industries Ltd strengthened to 244, adding 2%.The move by cigarette makers is seen as a step to protect margins, with the expected decline in EBIT now projected at around 2%, sharply lower than earlier estimates of 8–15%. The changes follow the government’s notification on February 1 ending the GST compensation cess and introducing a new tobacco taxation framework.ITC Ltd is likely to increase cigarette prices by 20–40% across brands. Fresh shipments reflecting the revised pricing are expected to reach the market soon, while retailers are also said to be selling existing inventory at higher rates.Market reaction was swift. ITC Ltd climbed 2% to Rs 331 during the session, extending its gains to a third straight day and taking its cumulative rise over three sessions to about 5.5%.Godfrey Phillips India Ltd jumped 12% to Rs 2,315 per share on the BSE, marking a more than 15% gain over two days. VST Industries Ltd also traded higher, advancing 3.3% in morning deals.The new taxation structure has reset excise duties on cigarettes to between Rs 2,050 and Rs 8,500 per 1,000 sticks, alongside a 40% GST. The revised regime has materially increased the overall tax burden, leading to concerns around demand trends, margins and the possibility of greater illicit trade.The Budget also introduced a technical change to the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD). The statutory NCCD rate on tobacco products has been raised from 25% to 60%, effective May 1, 2026. At the same time, it was clarified that the effective duty rate will continue at 25% through a notification, meaning there is no immediate increase in tax outgo for cigarette companies. In effect, while the duty remains unchanged for now, the government has enabled a future increase without requiring another amendment to the law.In the December quarter, ITC, the country’s largest cigarette manufacturer, reported revenue growth of 6.2% year-on-year. The performance was supported by double-digit expansion in its FMCG-Others business and steady momentum in cigarettes. Cigarette revenues rose 8%, driven by 7% growth in volumes.However, margins in the cigarette segment fell to 59.9%, a multi-quarter low, contracting by 163 basis points year-on-year due to the consumption of high-cost leaf inventory. Management indicated that leaf procurement prices have moderated in the current crop cycle, which could help support margins in the coming quarters.","ITC Ltd is likely to increase cigarette prices by 20–40% across brands.

Consumer-focused stocks under pressure

Warner Bros. Discovery gains on buyout talks

Big tech and AI concerns continue to linger

Bond yields steady, global markets mixed

US stocks were mixed in uneasy trading on Tuesday as companies flagged weakening consumer confidence and investors continued reassessing the impact of artificial intelligence on corporate earnings.The S&P 500 was virtually unchanged after swinging between a modest gain and a drop of nearly 1%.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28 points, or 0.1%, to 49,536.63, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1% to 22,532.05 in early trading.Shares of General Mills tumbled 6.9% after the maker of Cheerios, Nature Valley and Pillsbury products warned that customers are feeling uneasy.The company cut its forecast for an underlying measure of profit for 2026, saying declines are likely to be sharper than previously expected.Recent surveys have shown weak confidence among US households grappling with persistent inflation, a job market coming off a weak year of growth and concerns over tariffs.Genuine Parts dropped 12.3% after reporting weaker-than-expected quarterly results and saying it is “navigating a dynamic environment.”The auto and industrial replacement parts seller also announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies in early 2027, one focused on auto parts and the other on industrial parts.Providing some support to the broader market, Warner Bros. Discovery rose about 2.8–2.9% after reopening talks with Paramount Skydance on a buyout offer, giving it a week to top a rival bid from Netflix.Paramount Skydance shares climbed 6.9%, while Netflix dipped 0.2%.Losses in some Big Tech stocks weighed on the indexes. Alphabet fell 1.5%, while Nvidia swung between gains and losses, reflecting volatility in AI-linked stocks.Shares of Meta were flat, Nvidia slipped 0.1% at one stage and Palantir Technologies fell 0.3%.“The rut in the technology and AI stocks is continuing this morning,” said Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital Securities, as quoted by news agency AFP.“Investors are beginning to question: How long is it going to take for this spending to mature?” he added. “When you have an excessive amount of momentum in one sector, usually this is what happens. Negative market sentiment is going to have to run its course.”Investors have grown increasingly concerned that companies are pouring excessive amounts into AI infrastructure such as data centers and chips, without immediate clarity on returns.Alphabet, for instance, has said its spending on AI and other investments could double this year to roughly $180 billion.A survey of global fund managers by Bank of America found a record percentage believe companies are “overinvesting”.Sameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said markets need Big Tech stocks to stabilize and “need to see less sell first/ask questions later behavior from investors.”Chris Larkin, managing director for trading and investing at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley, noted that while the market remains close to record highs, sharp sell-offs have made it feel more fragile.“Overall, the market is still close to records highs, but it may not feel that way to some investors because of the sharp sell-offs that seem to derail upswings almost as soon as they begin,” Larkin said.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury edged up to 4.05% from 4.04% late Friday.Overseas, European markets advanced, while trading in Asia was muted due to Lunar New Year holidays. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4%, weighed down by weak economic data and a 5.1% drop in SoftBank Group.The decline followed a strong rally after the February 8 general election cleared the way for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s ruling party to push pro-economy policies.","The S&P 500 was virtually unchanged after swinging between a modest gain and a drop of nearly 1%.

Hair transplant costs in Turkey 2026: A transparent breakdown (no hidden fees),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hair-transplant-costs-in-turkey-2026-a-transparent-breakdown-no-hidden-fees/articleshow/128420641.cms,"Why Turkey is one of the leading destinations for hair transplant



Understanding the different hair transplant methods

FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction): In this method, single hair roots are taken from the back or sides of the head and moved to the areas where hair is thin or missing. FUE is popular because it leaves very small scars and gives a natural look. The cost of FUE in Turkey is usually between $1,500 and $4,000, depending on the number of hair roots required.



DHI (Direct Hair Implantation): A newer method in which hair roots are inserted directly into the scalp using a special pen-shaped tool. This way is more exact and helps more hair roots survive. Because DHI is more detailed, it usually costs more than FUE. In Turkey, DHI usually costs between $2,000 and $5,500.



Factors that influence hair transplant costs in Turkey

Number of grafts: One of the most significant factors that influences the cost is the number of hair follicles (grafts) that need to be transplanted. Generally, the more grafts required, the higher the cost. For example, if you need a large number of grafts for extensive hair restoration, the price will increase accordingly.



Clinic reputation and surgeon experience: The clinic's name and the doctor's experience also affect the price. Top clinics with famous and skilled doctors may charge more. Still, this can be worth it because experienced doctors are more likely to deliver natural-looking results and fewer complications.



Location: The clinic's location in Turkey can also affect the price. Istanbul, which is the main city for medical visitors, usually has higher prices than smaller cities. Still, the price difference is usually small, and you can get great care anywhere in the country.



All-inclusive packages: Many clinics in Turkey offer packages for international clients that include everything. These packages usually cover the surgery, travel, hotel, and post-surgery care. Even if the price looks higher, these packages often give you more for your money because they include extra services that make things easier.



Why transparency in pricing is crucial

Hair loss is a concern for many individuals, and as hair restoration technology advances, more people are opting for hair transplant surgeries to regain their confidence. One of the most sought-after destinations for these procedures is Turkey, which has become a global leader in hair transplants. But while hair transplant in Turkey offers high-quality services at an affordable price, it’s essential for patients to understand the cost breakdown.Before looking at the costs, it’s important to know why hair transplants in Turkey are so popular. Turkey is known for being affordable, having skilled doctors, and using the latest technology.Hair transplants in Turkey cost a fraction of what they would in other countries, such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Despite this significant price difference, Turkey offers the same high standards of care and expertise, making it the go-to choice for individuals seeking hair restoration procedures.The cost of a hair transplant in Turkey changes based on a few things, like which method is used, how much hair you have lost, and which clinic you pick. The two most common methods for hair transplantation are Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) and Direct Hair Implantation (DHI). These methods differ in how they are performed and in cost.The price difference between FUE and DHI mostly depends on how skilled the doctor is, what kind of equipment the clinic uses, and how much hair you have lost. Sometimes, DHI costs more because it needs more careful work.While the chosen method plays a significant role in determining cost, other factors also contribute to the overall price of a hair transplant in Turkey. Here’s a breakdown of what you should expect:When choosing a hair transplant in Turkey, clear pricing is very important. Many people from other countries worry about hidden fees or surprise costs. The best clinics in Turkey ensure they provide clear pricing so patients know exactly what to expect before surgery.Good clinics will give you a clear list of all costs, including extras like travel, hotel, and post-surgery care. If a clinic offers a package that includes everything, make sure the price covers the first visit, the surgery, and post-surgery care.You should also be careful with clinics that have very low prices. Even though Turkey is affordable, prices much lower than normal might indicate poor service or doctors with little experience. Always choose quality and skill over just a low price to get the best results.When thinking about a hair transplant in Turkey, Dr. Serkan Aygin’s clinic is one of the best choices for people from other countries. Dr. Aygin is a well-known expert in hair restoration, known for his meticulous work, personal attention, and outstanding results.

China Buys More Russian Crude As India Steps Back

Even as US President Donald Trump wants the world to stop buying crude oil from Russia, China’s purchases of Russian crude are set to hit a new record in February. China’s procurement of Russian crude is expected to rise for a third consecutive month in February, reaching a fresh record as independent refiners increase buying of heavily discounted cargoes.Shipments of Russian oil to China are projected at about 2.07 million barrels per day for February delivery. This is more than January’s estimated 1.7 million barrels per day, based on preliminary assessments by Vortexa Analytics. Separate provisional figures from Kpler indicate imports of roughly 2.083 million barrels per day in February, compared with 1.718 million barrels per day a month earlier.This comes amidst India reducing its intake, according to traders and vessel-tracking data quoted by Reuters.Data from Kpler shows India’s imports of Russian crude are likely to decline further to around 1.159 million barrels per day in February. The reduced demand has pushed Russian crude prices lower, with cargoes for January and February delivery to China trading at discounts of $9 to $11 per barrel to benchmark ICE Brent.These discounts are among the deepest seen in recent years for the Urals grade, which is shipped from European ports and had typically been directed to India because of shorter shipping distances compared with China.Since November, China has overtaken India as Russia’s largest buyer of seaborne crude. Western sanctions linked to the war in Ukraine, along with pressure on New Delhi to advance a trade agreement with the United States, prompted India to scale back Russian oil purchases to a two-year low in December, the Reuters report said.Also Read | Trump removes 25% penal tariff: What happens if India stops buying Russian crude oil? Supplies of Urals, along with other export grades such as Sokol and Varandey, have added to regular shipments of Russia’s flagship ESPO blend exported from the Far East port of Kozmino, which is geographically closer to China. This has intensified competition with rival crude supplies from Iran.Concerns over potential US military action against Iran have unsettled China’s independent refiners, commonly referred to as teapots, which are among the largest buyers globally of oil subject to US sanctions from Russia, Iran and Venezuela.According to a senior Chinese trader who frequently supplies these refiners, Russian crude has recently gained a competitive edge over Iranian oil in terms of processing quality relative to price. The trader noted that the ESPO blend was last traded at discounts of about $8 to $9 per barrel to ICE Brent for March deliveries, while Iranian Light — a comparable grade — was assessed at roughly $10 to $11 below the same benchmark.Market uncertainty since January regarding the possibility of US strikes on Iran, in the event that nuclear negotiations fail to meet Washington’s expectations, has made Chinese teapots and traders more cautious about purchasing Iranian cargoes, said Emma Li, China analyst at Vortexa.She explained that concerns over potential disruptions to Iranian oil loadings in the event of military tensions have made Russian supplies appear more dependable to buyers. Li also indicated that part of the recent increase in Russian crude purchases has come from larger independent refiners located outside Shandong, the main hub for teapot refiners.Vortexa estimated that Iranian oil shipments to China, often labelled as Malaysian by traders to bypass US sanctions, declined to around 1.03 million barrels per day this month, compared with approximately 1.25 million barrels per day in January.","China’s procurement of Russian crude is expected to rise for a third consecutive month in February.

Asian markets showed little movement on Monday as several trading floors closed for Lunar New Year celebrations. Japan's disappointing economic growth of just 0.1 per cent in late 2025 added pressure on newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Meanwhile, US markets will stay shut for Presidents' Day, and gold prices dipped slightly after reaching $5,000 per ounce.The holiday closures affected mainland China, Seoul, and Taipei, while Hong Kong and Singapore operated only half-day sessions. The slow trading day followed a tech sector decline last week, triggered by worries about massive AI infrastructure investments.Japan's weak GDP numbers fell short of the expected 0.4% growth, creating challenges for Takaichi, who won recent elections promising economic improvement.""The weak growth implies that the large supplementary budget passed at the end of November provided no boost to public spending last quarter just yet,"" said Marcel Thieliant at Capital Economics. He suggested Takaichi might need to act quickly on tax reforms and new budgets.Most Asian markets saw minor losses. Tokyo dropped 0.03%, while Hong Kong managed a 0.4% gain. The market mood improved after US inflation data showed a bigger-than-expected cooling in January.The AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, featuring tech leaders like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Google's Sundar Pichai, starts Monday. The event comes amid growing concerns about AI's social and environmental impacts, despite its role in boosting tech company profits.""US inflation data was good.

'Harsh Lesson': Iran Threatens U.S. Of Deadly Retaliation If Islamic Republic Is Attacked

Global oil prices remained steady on Monday as markets closely watch upcoming talks between United States and Iran.

The day saw Brent crude futures slightly down at $67.72 per barrel, while US WTI crude stood at $62.86.The market's cautious stance comes ahead of crucial negotiations between Washington and Tehran in Geneva on Tuesday.

China Defies UN Sanctions, Helps Iran Rearm After War With Israel, Says Report

US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House on Wednesday to reportedly discuss plans for reducing Iran's oil sales to China, which currently handles over 80 per cent of Iran's oil exports. The agreement comes amid ongoing nuclear talks between US and Iranian officials through Omani mediators.A senior US official told Axios, ""We agreed that we will go full force with maximum pressure against Iran, for example, regarding Iranian oil sales to China,"" as reported by Reuters. This move could significantly impact Iran's oil revenue.The diplomatic efforts coincide with the US positioning a naval fleet in the region. The American military is said to be preparing for potential extended operations against Iran that could last several weeks, according to various media reports.China's response to these developments remains unknown, as no official statement has been given amid the Lunar New Year holiday.In a separate development around US-Iran relations, exiled son of Iran’s last shah Reza Pahlavi, on Saturday called on US President Donald Trump to help the Iranian people, saying it was “time to end the Islamic republic.”Speakingat the Munich Security Conference, Pahlavi said, “It is time to end the Islamic republic.”“This is the demand echoing from the bloodshed of my compatriots who are not asking us to fix the regime but to help them bury it,” he added, as quoted by AFP.Reza Pahlavi directly appealed to Donald Trump, telling reporters, “The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them.”Earlier, Trump had said on Friday that a change of government in Iran would be “the best thing that could happen,” as a second aircraft carrier was deployed to the Middle East to intensify military pressure on the Islamic republic. He had earlier warned of possible military action in support of nationwide protests that peaked in January and were followed by a harsh crackdown that rights groups say left thousands dead.","US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House on Wednesday.

China will remove tariffs on imports from almost all African countries starting May 1, Chinese President Xi Jinping said, according to state media, in a move expected to deepen trade and economic engagement between Beijing and the continent, AFP reported.China already operates a zero-tariff policy for imports from 33 African countries, but Beijing had announced last year that it would expand the policy to all 53 African countries with which it has diplomatic relations.Under the expanded framework, zero levies will apply to all African nations except Eswatini, which maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan. China claims the democratic island as its own and has not ruled out the use of force to assert control over it.China remains Africa’s largest trading partner and has played a major role in infrastructure development across the continent through its Belt and Road Initiative.The move comes at a time when several African countries are diversifying trade relationships, particularly after US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs globally last year.Xi said the zero-tariff arrangement “will undoubtedly provide new opportunities for African development”, while announcing the timeline as leaders across Africa gathered in Ethiopia for the annual African Union summit.The expansion of tariff-free access is expected to strengthen China’s economic influence in Africa while boosting trade flows and market access for African exporters.","China will remove tariffs on imports from almost all African countries starting May 1.

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence

The economy of Pakistan is in a risky state due to its over-reliance on short-term foreign loans, according to business leaders and economists. Key figures are calling for urgent negotiations with friendly nations to extend loan repayment periods and implement structural reforms, as reported by Express Tribune.Vice chairman of the Pakistan industrial and traders associations front (PIAF) Raja Waseem Hassan warned that without extending loan maturities, the country will continue to face balance-of-payments problems. While foreign reserves have grown to $21 billion in January 2026, experts say this improvement relies too heavily on temporary support from international institutions and friendly countries.""The government must immediately begin serious negotiations with friendly nations to secure longer repayment periods and ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves,"" said Hassan. He welcomed recent positive diplomatic developments with Gulf states and the United States but cautioned that these relationships can change quickly.The country's trade performance remains concerning. Exports stood at $32 billion in FY25, while imports continue to exceed export earnings. Dr. Saleem Ahmed, a senior economist, warned that Pakistan can't rely forever on rollovers and short-term deposits. He suggests the country needs 5-6 per cent annual growth to stabilize its debt-to-GDP ratio, which currently hovers around 70 per cent.Economic growth prospects remain modest. The IMF expects 3.6% GDP growth for FY26, while the State Bank of Pakistan projects 3.75-4.75%. Though inflation has dropped from its 38% peak in 2023, strict monetary policies have slowed industrial growth and business lending.Experts recommended focusing on export-oriented sectors like textiles, IT, and agricultural processing. They suggest improving tax collection, reducing energy waste, and boosting remittances, which could reach $42 billion in FY26. They also stress the need to increase foreign direct investment beyond its current annual level of $1.5-2 billion to reduce dependency on external borrowing.Hassan pointedout that while Pakistan's military importance can help in diplomacy, economic strength is crucial for long-term stability. ""Economic strength must be the real shield. Without strong buffers and self-reliance, external partnerships alone cannot guarantee stability,"" he said.","Pakistan's economy is in a risky state due to its over-reliance on short-term foreign loans.

An underlying inflation measure — considered a better predictor of future price trends — slowed to its lowest level in nearly five years.“It’s still too high, but only for now, not forever,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management.Cooling inflation could provide the Federal Reserve greater room to cut interest rates if required. While the Fed has paused rate cuts for now, markets broadly expect easing to resume later this year.Lower borrowing costs could support economic growth and equity markets, though they also carry the risk of reigniting inflation.The broader economic backdrop also appears stronger compared to late 2025, supported by easing inflation and stronger-than-expected job market data last month.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell to 4.06% from 4.09% on Thursday.On Wall Street, stocks of companies previously seen as vulnerable to AI disruption stabilised.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

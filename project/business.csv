Flexibility in Tax Regime Selection for Salary TDS

Income Tax Filing FY 2024-25 : Employers are currently requesting salaried employees to provide documentation of tax-saving investments and expenses if they wish to reduce their tax liability. These documents are essential to prevent complete tax deduction at source (TDS) from the salary.Most employees typically have until March to provide tax-saving documentation, however it is beneficial to submit them promptly. Until documentation is provided, employers will deduct the full tax amount from salary without considering any tax-saving investments. Tax specialists indicate that not every employee needs to submit investment documentation.Regarding who must provide investment proof to avoid complete salary taxation, Prakash Hegde, a practising Chartered Accountant, told ET, ""The employees who have opted for the old tax regime are required to submit investment proofs to their employers to claim exemptions and deductions via their employer. The employees who have opted for the new tax regime need not have to submit any proof for exemption and deductions as most of them are not available in the new tax regime.""The Income Tax Act, 1961's old tax regime provides various tax exemptions and deductions that individuals can claim to decrease their gross taxable income.

Merging of 2 platforms led to gold's double counting: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/merging-of-2-platforms-led-to-golds-double-counting-government/articleshow/117100901.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: Systems-related glitches, following the integration of two platforms, resulted in double counting of gold and silver shipped from special economic zones (SEZs) to the domestic area, inflating the import of yellow metal by $5 billion in Novemer, a problem which has largely been fixed, government said on Thursday.While around 2.5 lakh export and import related data is reported to the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence & Statistics (DGCI&S) from anywhere between 300 and 500 locations every day, the integration of Indian Customs Electronic Gateway or ICEGATE with NSDL platform, that provided data on SEZs caused the error.NSDL data was sent to DGCI&S directly until July, when data from 110 locations was sent to ICEGATE. Following the integration, the bills of entry when gold and silver entered an SEZ and a part of it being sold to the domestic tariff area were captured separately, resulting in double counting. Even now all units in SEZs have not fully migrated to the new system.In a statement, the commerce department said revisions are done periodically, as is the case for all statistics. ""The revision is based on data that's received late, amendments in the respective months and qualitative corrections wherever required,"" it said.Besides, a panel comprising officials from DGCI&S and DG Systems from the customs side has been tasked with ensuring a robust system for data collection and collation. While trade numbers have been revised for April-Nov 2024, govt is checking if revision from April 2023 is required when the change began.","System-related glitches resulted in double counting of gold and silver shipped from special economic zones (SEZs) to the domestic area, inflating the import of yellow metal by $5 billion in Novemer.

Adani raises offer-for-sale size to 20% in Wilmar JV,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-raises-offer-for-sale-size-to-20-in-wilmar-jv/articleshow/117100814.cms,"File photo

MUMBAI: Adani Group has decided to increase the size of its offer for sale (OFS) to offload part of its stake in Adani Wilmar to 20 per cent from 13 per cent announced earlier, due to strong demand from institutional investors. The change in contours of the deal was triggered by strong institutional interest for the company's shares, sources said.Higher OFS size also helps the Adani group to get some part of the money faster, as the original deal (stake-sale to Wilmar) could be implemented over one year. This also helps Wilmar as it would need to bring in less money on the table soon, sources said. As a result, after the completion of the whole deal that would see Adani exiting Adani Wilmar, the holding of Wilmar, the Singapore-based FMCG major, would be 68 per cent , sources said.On Thursday, Adani Commodities, one of the promoters of Adani Wilmar that holds 44 per cent stake, told the exchanges that it will sell 20 per cent of its holding in the company through the OFS route. The stake sale is estimated to bring in at least Rs 7,150 crore for the Ahmedabad-based conglomerate. The minimum per-share price in the offer is Rs 275, a 15 per cent discount to Adani Wilmar's closing price on BSE on Thursday.The deal is part of the 44 per cent that the Adani Group plans to offload for about $2 billion to completely exit the FMCG business. The sale proceeds will free up funds for the group to invest in its core business of building infrastructure. On Nov 21 last year two US govt agencies had indicted Adani group chairman Gautam Adani and some other top executives for their attempt to bribe Indian government officials and hiding it from US investors while selling bonds issued by group companies. The group had denied all the allegations in the indictment orders by two US govt arms. However, post the indictments, fundraising for the group has become an uphill task.The base offer for Adani Wilmar that owns the Fortune sunflower oil and Kohinoor basmati rice brands, is for about 17.5 crore shares (13.5 per cent of the company), with the option to offload an additional 8.4 crore shares (6.5 per cent ). The offer will open on Jan 10 and close on Jan 13.After Wilmar consolidates its stake in Adani Wilmar, the Singaporean company will implement a business approach comparable to ITC's, utilising the Indian arm's primary edible oil operations and widespread distribution channels to boost its other FMCG products' growth. ITC had leveraged its cigarette business to expand into new FMCG categories. Post the completion of the deal, the company will be renamed AWL, AWL Agri Business, or Fortune Agri Business.Adani Wilmar's FMCG portfolio had recorded a 24 per cent volume growth year-on-year in the December quarter of this fiscal. Its edible oil business, predominantly under the 'Fortune' brand, has a distribution network reaching 2.1 million outlets. Despite its declining share, the edible oil business still accounts for a lion's share of 80 per cent of the company's revenues.In India, the Wilmar Group also has a 62.5 per cent stake in Shree Renuka Sugars, a leading sugar producer in the country. Five brokers__Antique Stock Broking, ICICI Securities, Jefferies India, Nuvama Wealth Management and SBICAP Securities__are managing the offer, term sheet for the OFS showed.","Adani Group has decided to increase the size of its offer for sale (OFS) to offload part of its stake in Adani Wilmar to 20 per cent.

MUMBAI: Despite volatile stock market conditions last month, retail investors put their money in equities through the mutual fund route, with total inflows at Rs 41,156 crore.Dec also recorded the highest-ever gross monthly flows through the systematic investment plan route, at almost Rs 26,460 crore, data released by MF industry trade body Amfi showed. This was the 46th month of net inflows into equity funds, beginning March 2021, an Amfi release said. The momentum of fund inflow through equity schemes underscores the maturity of Indian investors and behavioural changes in the backdrop of market volatility and economic slowdown, Sanjay Bembalkar, head of equity at Union MF, said.Among the equity schemes, mid and small-cap categories together recorded inflows of Rs 9,761 crore, at a new monthly high since April 2019. However, sectoral & thematic funds recorded the biggest net inflow within the category at Rs 15,332 crore. ""These numbers indicate structural change in investing culture, thought process maturity and awareness among investors,"" Bembalkar said.The MF industry's total assets under management, however, declined to Rs 66.9 lakh crore from Rs 68.1 lakh crore in Nov. The decline in month-end AUM could be attributed to the sharp outflow from several debt funds, mainly from overnight, liquid and money market schemes.","Despite volatile stock market conditions last month, retail investors put their money in equities through the mutual fund route.

MUMBAI: Claims for hospitalisation under cancer saw the highest increase in incidence, with the number of cases rising by 12 per cent in 2024. This was closely followed by cardiac ailments. In 2024, five conditions accounted for most hospitalisation claims for insurance companies. Among the five, claims for respiratory ailments experienced the highest inflation, with costs increasing by 10-13 per cent .The health insurance data is based on an analysis of claims by MediAssist Healthcare Services , the largest third-party administrator of health insurance and which processes over a fifth of all hospitalisation claims.In the case of cancer, the incidence - per cent of claims with respect to overall insured - has been observed to rise after the age of 40, with a steeper increase among women. ""Women are observed to have a 1.2-1.5 times higher incidence rate with respect to men, while data suggests that men have approximately a 1.3-1.5 times higher rate of cardiac ailments compared to women,"" Dhruv Rastogi, senior VP & head of data science at MediAssist, said.For other ailments, medical inflation remained in single digits. For instance, treatment costs for cancer rose by up to 6.5 per cent , and for cardiac ailments by up to 8 per cent .For senior citizens, the most common reason for hospitalisation (for health claims) was cataract treatment. ""There is now a lot of awareness and increased facilities for surgeries, which has resulted in early detection and more procedures,"" Dr Vijay Sankaran, chief claims officer at MediAssist, said. He attributes the high inflation in the treatment of respiratory ailments to increased diagnoses, pollution, and the potential long-term impact of Covid, although this has not been definitively established. ""In the post-Covid era, people are more cautious about respiratory ailments, which have become more severe due to pollution, driving them to hospitals for better intervention,"" he noted.Sankaran also said that while people are living longer, they are not necessarily healthier. ""As our economies develop, food patterns have changed, and there is more stress. There are increased cases of diabetes and hypertension, which contribute to the rise in heart diseases. Additionally, an increase in diagnostics post-Covid is leading to earlier intervention.""""So, while infectious and communicable diseases have decreased, ailments that do not kill you immediately but persist for a long time have increased,"" he added.

However, in dollar terms, its revenue rose 3.6% to $7.5 billion during the same period.TCS's underwhelming sequential performance was affected by seasonality and a softer discretionary and demand environment. Many verticals saw sequential negative growth, which dampened its scorecard.The Dec quarter is typically weak for IT firms, marred by furloughs and fewer working days, even as clients held back on discretionary spending. Its key geographies, North America and Continental Europe, declined 2.3% and 1.5% respectively. Its mainstay BFSI sector remained flat with a meagre 0.9% growth compared to the year-ago period.

However, the point we wanted to emphasise here is the total contract value (TCV) growing after two quarters and in North America, BFSI, and CPG, and this gives us confidence in the medium term. I mentioned BFSI and the consumer business, but we have observed early trends in a few other verticals as well. Overall, this is what gives us confidence,"" TCS CEO K Krithivasan said.""We have also seen an improvement in sentiments regarding discretionary spending. Once the new govt comes in the US, there will be more certainty. There will be more confidence in discretionary spending,"" he added.TCS's order book stood at $10.2 billion in the Dec quarter, compared to $8.6 billion in the preceding one. The BSNL contract has reached its peak, according to Krithivasan, and he anticipates a gradual decline while expressing confidence in growth from other regions. A consortium led by TCS won a contract for over Rs 15,000 crore from BSNL for deploying 4G networks across India. It's one of the biggest domestic IT services deals so far.","TCS's underwhelming sequential performance was affected by seasonality and a softer discretionary and demand environment. Many verticals saw sequential negative growth, which dampened its scorecard. The Dec quarter is typically weak for IT firms, marred by furloughs and fewer working days.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117100794,imgsize-1209345,width-400,resizemode-4/117100794.jpg"
Industry calls for easier FDI rules to boost flows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/industry-calls-for-easier-fdi-rules-to-boost-flows/articleshow/117100706.cms,"FDI

NEW DELHI: Industry and law firms have suggested an increase in FDI cap for R&D and security agencies, liberalising regulations for agriculture and plantations and streamlining rules for flow of investments from China to make the overall regime more attractive.The issues were flagged during a consultation by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) on Wednesday, where some of the issues related to e-commerce, pharma as well as financial services came up for discussions.Wednesday's meeting was part of the periodic consultations undertaken by the department but are seen to be crucial, coming ahead of the Union Budget on February 1. A source present in the meeting told TOI that DPIIT also sought suggestions from law firms and industry representatives on whether any procedural simplifications were required to step up FDI flows into the country.""The consultations were to understand investor concerns and deliberate on policies to increase FDI inflows in India,"" another source said. FDI flows have picked up in recent months after moderation during the last few years.One of the issues flagged by the law firms, which work with global clients, was related to FDI from China, which faces scrutiny and is no longer on the automatic route. While several industry players have been making a case for easing the checks, during the deliberations, some of the participants sought clear processes and timelines in processing these applications. The govt has been taking a case-by-case approach and prioritising Chinese investments which it believes are helpful and ""safe"". There were also some queries related to significant beneficial ownership related to Chinese entities.One of the industry bodies has suggested that non-debt instrument (NDI) rules be aligned with the FDI policy for increase of FDI cap up to 74% in the private security agencies sector, while also amending the law governing the companies in this space.Besides, there was a proposal to ease FDI in agriculture and plantation sectors with industry representatives arguing that this will help reduce imports from China and supporting the manufacturing sector in India. Another proposal was to allow 100% FDI in research & development across all sectors to position India as a hub.""Foreign owned and controlled companies face ambiguities related to pricing of equity instruments, the possibility of engaging in share swaps, and entering into deferred payment consideration arrangements. These need to be clarified,"" said a source.",Industry and law firms suggest increase in FDI cap for R&D and security agencies. Also suggest liberalising regulations for agriculture and plantations. Streamlining rules for flow of investments from China to make overall regime more attractive.

MUMBAI: A battle is brewing between restaurants and food delivery giants Swiggy and Zomato following their foray into quick food delivery service through the launch of separate apps - seen largely as a response to rival Zepto's standalone cafe app. The move has irked restaurateurs who allege the companies have used their customer data to make and sell private labelled food through the apps which are currently operating in select areas.Swiggy and Zomato-owned Blinkit have launched standalone apps Snacc and Bistro respectively to deliver snacks, beverages, meals to customers in 10-15 minutes. ""This is clearly an abuse of dominance. Swiggy and Zomato are taking unfair advantage of our data and entering our territory. We are going to take legal recourse,"" Anurag Katriar, trustee at National Restaurant Association of India ( NRAI ), told TOI. Restaurants said that by selling private labelled food, they are essentially becoming food service players and not limiting themselves as marketplaces which is what their core operational model is meant to be.Zomato and Swiggy's multi-billion dollar food delivery businesses have been built over the years through their partnership with restaurants. With Covid nudging Indians to shop online, the companies started delivering groceries in minutes, eventually building a market for quick commerce. Today, Zomato (through Blinkit) and Swiggy - alongside players like Zepto and Tata's BigBasket - deliver groceries, electronics, apparel, occasionally iPhones in 10 minutes and now have even forayed into the 10-minute food delivery space.""We have no reason to not believe them migrating our customers to the products they sell as private labels on their apps. Be it data from a tea brand, biryani or momos,"" Sagar Daryani, co-founder & CEO at Wow! Momo Foods and president of NRAI, said.Swiggy has a 10-minute food delivery service Bolt (offered within the main app) and Zomato is also providing a 15-minute delivery option. However, restaurants are not opposing those services because they operate under the same aggregator model wherein the food is being delivered through partnership with them. ""As long as these aggregators are okay working with restaurants and enable restaurants to go quick, we are absolutely fine with it. But we will not want to be demolished as an industry where they end up selling our similar products,"" Daryani added.Swiggy and Zomato did not respond to queries on the business models for the Snacc and Bistro apps.",Swiggy and Zomato-owned Blinkit have launched standalone apps Snacc and Bistro respectively.

However, the data suggests these initiatives have yet to significantly impact the world's second-largest economy.The whole of 2024 saw flat prices, reflecting the previous year's performance. The slowdown in spending, coupled with ongoing challenges in the property market and local government financing, has cast doubt on the feasibility of Beijing's growth targets.China emerged from a four-month deflationary period in February, following the sharpest price drop in 14 years. While falling prices may appear beneficial to consumers, deflation can harm the broader economy by prompting people to delay purchases in anticipation of further price reductions. This can lead to reduced demand, production cuts, job losses, and declining profitability for businesses.Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, noted that while recent economic data har been stable, it has yet to create sufficient upward pressure on consumer prices.""The deflationary pressure is persistent,"" he stated.President Xi Jinping recently stated that China’s economy likely grew by around 5 per cent last year, aligning with the government’s target.However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated a slightly lower growth of 4.8 per cent.

McDonald's rolls back diversity practices; which other US firms have done the same?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/mcdonalds-rolls-back-diversity-practices-which-other-us-firms-have-done-the-same/articleshow/117032353.cms,"What is the DEI initiative?

Other companies scaling back DEI initiatives

Walmart

Ford

Lowe’s

John Deere

Tractor Supply

McDonald’s has announced crucial changes to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, joining a growing list of companies pulling back on such initiatives. The fast-food giant cited the US Supreme Court’s July 2023 ruling, which also banned affirmative action in college admissions, as a key factor influencing its decision.The Chicago-based burger chain will discontinue specific diversity goals for senior leadership and retire its program encouraging suppliers to adopt DEI training.Additionally, the fast food entity’s diversity team will be rebranded as the Global Inclusion Team, a shift the company says better reflects its values and business focus. Despite these changes,McDonald’s emphasised its commitment to fostering inclusion, calling a diverse workforce a “competitive advantage.”Back in 2021, McDonald's introduced a range of diversity initiatives following multiple sexual harassment lawsuits from employees and a discrimination lawsuit filed by a group of Black former franchise owners.At the time, McDonald's chairman and CEO Chris Kempczinski wrote in a LinkedIn post, ""As a world-leading brand that considers inclusion one of our core values, we will accept nothing less than real, measurable progress in our efforts to lead with empathy, treat people with dignity and respect, and seek out diverse points of view to drive better decision-making.""However, the company said that the ""shifting legal landscape"" following the Supreme Court decision and the actions of other corporations caused it to reconsider its own policies.This decision reflects a broader trend as conservative activists challenge DEI programs in corporate America, targeting workplace initiatives aimed at supporting historically marginalised groups. Critics argue such policies are unfair and advocate for equal opportunities without consideration of race, gender, or sexual orientation.The DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiative refers to a set of policies and programs aimed at promoting a more inclusive and equitable environment within organisations. These initiatives often include measures to promote diversity in leadership roles, support historically marginalised groups, and ensure fair treatment regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation.Conservative activists have been targeting companies through legal action and social media campaigns, aiming to challenge workplace initiatives. Their focus includes diversity programs and hiring practices designed to support historically marginalised groups, as well as broader objections to initiatives centred on gender identity and sexual orientation.The world’s largest retailer had announced earlier in November that it would not renew its five-year commitment to an equity racial centre established after George Floyd’s death in 2020. It also exited the Human Rights Campaign’s LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion index and revised its supplier diversity policies, ceasing to prioritise demographic factors such as race and gender.Furthermore, Walmart pledged to monitor its third party marketplace more closely to prevent the sale of products aimed at LGBTQ+ minors, such as chest binders for transgender youth.In August, Ford’s CEO Jim Farley outlined changes to the company’s DEI policies, including withdrawing from the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. Farley stated that thr company does not use hiring quotas or link compensation to diversity metrics but remains committed to fostering an inclusive workplace.“We will continue to put our effort and resources into taking care of our customers, our team, and our communities versus publicly commenting on the many polarizing issues of the day,” the memo stated.Lowe’s also reevaluated its DEI programs, consolidating employee resource groups into one organisation and stepping back from LGBTQ+ inclusion events like parades and festivals. The retailer said these adjustments were made following the Supreme Court’s affirmative action decision.Previously, the company had “individual groups representing diverse sections of our associate population.”It will cease to participate in festivals and parades that are outside of its business domain.In July, the farm equipment manufacturer announced it would no longer sponsor cultural awareness events or implement diversity quotas. John Deere also committed to auditing its training materials to ensure compliance with federal laws and to remove “socially motivated messages.”Moline, Illinois based company further added “the existence of diversity quotas and pronoun identification have never been and are not company policy.” However, it would still work to “track and advance” the diversity of the company.The rural retailer eliminated all DEI roles and goals in June after facing conservative backlash online. It also announced it would cease sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns and no longer be submitting data for the HRC index.The National Black Farmers Association also called on Tractor Supply’s president and CEO to step down shortly after the company's announcement.","McDonald's has announced changes to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies.

South Korea, renowned global leader in the cosmetics and plastic surgery sector, achieved a significant milestone in its K-beauty industry with exports surpassing the $10 billion mark in 2024, according to the government data released on Monday.Yonhap news agency reported that as per the ministry of food and drug safety, the total value of South Korea's cosmetic exports surged by 20.6 per cent annually, reaching an all time high of $10.2 billion.This impressive growth was credited to the Hallyu wave which amplified the global appeal of Korean cultural exports like K-pop and K-dramas.China emerged as the largest importer of South Korean cosmetics, purchasing $2.5 billion worth of products.

Investors are on the lookout for the next big play, and everybody is wondering which token might rival Shiba Inu 's legendary 2021 rally. Fartcoin and Remittix are among the contenders generating buzz, each with unique features and potential. While Fartcoin has caught attention with its quirky appeal, Remittix stands out in terms of real-world utility and game-changing technology. Let’s find out why experts believe Remittix is more likely to achieve 1,000x returns. Remittix is a crypto platform that intends to revolutionize and streamline the crypto-to-fiat transaction pipeline. Remittix's PayFi protocol allows anybody with a crypto wallet to send fiat cash to any account globally, offering significantly lower fees compared to services like Western Union or MoneyGram.The magic lies in how Remittix connects local payment networks with over 40 blockchain ecosystems. The recipient doesn’t need to know the transaction came from crypto, and senders avoid foreign exchange fees entirely.This innovative approach simplifies crypto-to-fiat transactions, solving a major market need. Many experts believe Remittix could become the top choice for individuals and businesses seeking a seamless way to handle crypto and fiat payments.With blockchain technology ensuring secure, tamper-proof payment records, Remittix already earned the nickname “Ripple 2.0.” Its native token, $RTX, features a token vesting plan to maintain long-term value and stability. Token holders also enjoy staking rewards of up to 18% APY and governance rights.Currently priced at just $0.0185, $RTX offers an exciting opportunity for early investors. Industry predictions suggest it could surpass $1 by 2025, making it a potential game-changer in the DeFi space.Since its launch in October, Fartcoin has quickly gained a massive following. It reached a $1 billion market cap faster than major memecoins like Dogecoin, which took eight years to hit the same milestone. The coin even broke into mainstream culture, catching the attention of late-night host Stephen Colbert.Recently, Fartcoin hit an all-time high of $1.53 and is now trading at $1.45, reflecting a 66% increase over the past week. Its rapid rise is partly linked to its connection with Truth Terminal, an AI-driven X account that inspired the coin’s name. The project was later launched on the Solana-based meme coin platform Pump.fun.Fartcoin’s unique origins and strong momentum have positioned it as one of the most talked-about memecoins in the market today.The Shiba Inu (SHIB) team has officially announced its long-awaited TREAT token launch this January. While the exact date hasn’t been revealed, the announcement came from TREAT’s official X account, generating excitement among investors.This milestone follows years of delays and marks a breakthrough for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. In 2024, the team used $12 million from a TREAT token fundraiser to develop its Layer-3 privacy blockchain. Although a public sale was expected shortly after, no timeline was provided, leading to speculation.Shytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, emphasized that TREAT will drive the project closer to full decentralization while supporting innovation and growth. Currently trading at $0.00002432, Shiba Inu has risen 6% since January 3rd, with CoinCodex predicting a 109% price surge after the next U.S. presidential inauguration. Remittix stands out as the top contender for 1,000x gains in 2025, thanks to its real-world utility and innovative payment solution. Unlike Shiba Inu or Fartcoin, it solves a genuine problem by simplifying global crypto-to-fiat transactions. With strong fundamentals and growing adoption, Remittix is primed for explosive growth.Join the Remittix (RTX) presale and community:","Remittix is a crypto platform that intends to revolutionize and streamline the crypto-to-fiat transaction pipeline.

'Unrealistic scheduling': US Transportation department slaps $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/unrealistic-scheduling-us-transportation-department-slaps-a-2-million-penalty-on-jetblue-airways/articleshow/116923380.cms,"Settlement

Chronic delays



The US transportation department has imposed a $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways for persistent delays on its east coast routes. Half of the fine would be distributed as compensation to affected passengers. This marks the first instance of an airline being fined for chronic delays on specific routes, which the department attributed to JetBlue’s “unrealistic scheduling,” the agency said.Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg criticised the airline, stating, “Illegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today’s action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality.”JetBlue, however, shifted part of the blame onto the government’s air traffic control system .Spokesperson Derek Dombrowski said the airline had invested “tens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays” caused by air traffic control challenges in key markets, including the Northeast and Florida which led to improved on-time performance in 2024, especially during peak summer travel.Dombrowski called the incoming Trump administration to modernise outdated air traffic control systems and address staffing shortages among controllers.The department identified chronic delays on JetBlue flights between June 2022 and November 2023. Problematic routes included flights from New York’s JFK Airport to Raleigh-Durham, Fort Lauderdale, and Orlando, as well as flights from Windsor Locks, Connecticut, to Fort Lauderdale.JetBlue has since agreed to a settlement over delays on four specific routes.“While we’ve reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four (routes) in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the US government, which operates our nation’s air traffic control system,” Dombrowski revealed.Under the regulations set by the transportation department, airlines must not publish unrealistic schedules, ensuring departure and arrival times reflect operational realities. A flight is deemed chronically delayed if it operates at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late in over half of those instances.","The US transportation department has imposed a $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways for persistent delays on its east coast routes.

Investments by companies owned by Elon Musk don’t represent a threat to Italy, according to Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni .“I work to have major investments in Italy and evaluate the usefulness of each investment through the prism of our national interest,” the premier told Corriere della Sera in response to a question on risks to national security.Meloni’s ties to Musk, the world’s richest person, have created headlines in Italy, with the billionaire even bestowing an award on her in New York.At the same time, Musk has waded into the Italian political and business scene, at one point warning that the country needs to produce more children, and at another claiming phone carrier Telecom Italia SpA was obstructing a high-speed rollout by his Starlink Inc.Musk and Meloni have discussed investment opportunities in the space and artificial intelligence sectors, and Italy’s new regulatory framework grants foreign space companies permission to operate in the country.Meloni is “authentic, honest, truthful — and that can’t always be said about politicians,” Musk said during the award ceremony in September.The appreciation appears to be mutual, with the premier telling Corriere that Musk is “like a genius” who’s been depicted “as a monster only because he’s chosen the ‘wrong’ side” politically.Other European politicians have been less upbeat on Musk, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his deputy, Robert Habeck, using their New Year addresses this week to castigate him over his backing for a far-right party in February’s snap election.Musk, a key figure in President-elect Donald Trump ’s transition team, will have a top advisory role in the new US government.","Giorgia Meloni’s ties to Musk have created headlines in Italy, with the billionaire even bestowing an award on her in New York.

What Bloomberg strategists are saying...

While the notable absence of a Santa Rally has previously led to a rebound in stocks for the month of January, the year’s first trading day doesn’t offer a great signal for the whole 12-month period. Over the past four years, for example, it has actually been a contrarian indicator, Deutsche Bank notes. The S&P 500 ended the year inversely of how it started.

Extending that analysis back to 1928, the year’s first trading day and the SPX’s annual performance have a poor correlation and have only moved in tandem ~50% of the time.

Euro bludgeoned

Major US benchmarks extended a selloff for a fifth day, shaving more than a trillion dollars from share prices. A pair of deadly attacks compounded market angst, starting the first trading day of the year on a dour note.An early rally collapsed driving the Nasdaq 100 down more than 1%.

The Cboe Volatility Index climbed for the fourth time in five days.Tesla sagged after the electronic vehicle-marker’s fourth-quarter deliveries missed estimates and annual sales dropped for the first time in over a decade. The stock registered its worst five-day drop in more than two years.For corporate earnings, 2025 will be a “show-me year,” according to Lisa Shalett at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, who warned that the dominance of the Magnificent Seven — the big technology stocks responsible for the bulk of last year’s gains — was teetering. “This idea that they as a group can trade together and lead the market may falter in 2025,” she said. It’s a call echoed by others on Wall Street , including Bank of America Corp.’s Savita Subramanian.As for the grim slide in the final days of 2024, it’s “too soon to call it a bad omen,” Shalett told Bloomberg Television.Treasuries erased gains after a reading of weekly jobless claims fell to an eight-month low. A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar’s strength traded at a more than two-year peak.Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius noted that “seasonal adjustment challenges can make jobless claims readings particularly volatile around the holiday season.”US stocks had been straining to snap a losing streak that took some shine off the S&P 500’s best two-year run dating back to the late 1990s. The index has surged more than 50% since the start of 2023, driven by gains in the tech megacaps amid enthusiasm about the boost to profits from artificial intelligence.An attack on revelers celebrating New Year’s in New Orleans thrust US domestic security back into the spotlight less than a month before Donald Trump is sworn in as president. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing that incident as well as the deadly explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside of Trump’s hotel in Las Vegas.A shooting overnight at a nightclub in New York City only added to the anxiety, while authorities said it wasn’t related to terrorism.CBOE’s gauge of Wall Street stock sentiment, the VIX, touched 19. Readings above 20 indicate mounting concern over near-term volatility.On Friday, investors will be watching the House speaker vote to see if Mike Johnson will retain his position. GOP squabbling over his reelection could bode ill for the president-elect’s agenda, according to Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens report.If Johnson’s confirmation takes several rounds of voting over several days, “that will be a bad sign for Republican unity and hopes for quick action on pro-growth policies will take a hit,” he wrote.In the months to come, the growth outlook in Europe and China, the Federal Reserve’s policy path and Trump’s ability to execute on his campaign promises will be among the most pressing items on traders’ radars.European energy shares outperformed after a sharp increase in natural gas prices as the region braced for freezing winter temperatures without Russian supplies delivered via Ukraine. A transit contract between the two warring nations expired on New Year’s Day, with no alternative in place.The euro fell to the weakest against the dollar in over two years reflecting concerns about European growth, US trade tariffs and monetary policy divergence with the US.

"Tesla global sales drop first time in 9 years, down by 1.1%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-global-sales-drop-first-time-in-9-years-down-by-1-1/articleshow/116893005.cms,"Fourth quarter sales fall short of expectations

Tussle with rival companies

Divided outlook

For the first time in at least nine years, Tesla's global annual sales have recorded a decline, dropping by 1.1 per cent compared to 2023. The electric vehicle (EV) giant delivered 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, a slight decrease from the 1.81 million sold the previous year.A 2.3 per cent hike in fourth-quarter sales, reaching 495,570 vehicles, was insufficient to offset a sluggish start to the year, despite incentives like 0 per cent financing, free charging, and affordable lease options.This decline is primarily attributed to waning demand for electric vehicles in the US and other markets. Analysts suggest that many early adopters have already purchased EVs, while mainstream buyers remain cautious about factors such as driving range, price, and access to charging stations for longer trips.Tesla’s fourth-quarter sales also fell short of Wall Street estimates, with analysts expecting 498,000 deliveries. Production figures revealed similar challenges, with 459,445 vehicles produced in the quarter and 1.77 million for the year, both falling slightly below the year's total deliveries.Adding to Tesla's concerns, the average sales price of its vehicles is estimated to have dropped to just over $41,000 in the fourth quarter, the lowest in at least four years, according to analysts polled by FactSet. This pricing pressure, coupled with once-unheard-of discounts, has weighed on Tesla’s industry-leading profit margins.The dip in sales challenges Tesla’s 2022 prediction of 50 per cent annual growth, as the company faces an ageing model lineup and increased competition from legacy automakers and startups in China, Europe, and the US. Nearly all of Tesla's sales came from its smaller, more affordable Models 3 and Y, with just 23,640 deliveries of its higher-end Model X, Model S, and the new Cybertruck.Meanwhile, Chinese rival BYD is closing in on Tesla’s lead as the world’s top EV seller, reporting a 41 per cent increase in sales to 1.77 million EVs in 2024. Tesla narrowly maintained its edge, but the competition underscores the mounting pressure on the Austin, Texas-based company.Tesla shares dropped nearly 7 per cent on Thursday following the announcement. However, the stock remains up more than 50 per cent over the past year, driven partly by optimism surrounding Tesla’s advancements in AI-powered autonomous driving technology and the prospect of regulatory easing under Donald Trump's re-election.Industry analysts remain divided on Tesla’s outlook. Daniel Ives of Wedbush remains bullish, ""We have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,"" he said in a report, adding, ""and the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.""William Stein, an analyst at Truist Securities, told news agency AP, that Tesla will struggle to sell vehicles in future months and expects further discounting used to boost sales will weigh on its financial results.Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for 29 January, will be closely watched by investors and analysts seeking clarity on how the company plans to navigate intensifying competition and demand challenges in the evolving EV market.","Tesla delivered 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, a slight decrease from the 1.81 million sold the previous year.

As we bid farewell to 2024 and step into 2025, the cryptocurrency landscape is reflecting on the remarkable trends and shifts that shaped the year. The market has been buzzing with discussions surrounding five standout cryptocurrencies: Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Rexas Finance (RXS). These tokens have captured attention due to their distinctive features, dynamic market movements, and promising growth potential. With the dawn of 2025, speculation is mounting about how these coins will fare in the upcoming market cycle and whether they will maintain their momentum or face new challenges.Solana continues to maintain a robust position in the market, trading at an average of $181.88 with a market cap of $87.2 billion. Its strong investor sentiment, coupled with a technical pattern signaling bullish momentum, has positioned it for further growth. Analysts forecast SOL to target a range between $156.33 and $211.22 by 2025, with the possibility of exceeding $264 if market confidence strengthens. This outlook is supported by Solana’s consistent performance and high transaction volumes, suggesting it remains a cornerstone for decentralized applications.XRP has emerged as one of the most discussed tokens of 2024. Despite losing nearly 20% from its December peak, it remains over 320% higher than its November low. On-chain data shows a significant rise in wallet activity, indicating strong community interest. Market analysts are optimistic about XRP’s potential, particularly as its charts display signs of a bullish resurgence. As institutional adoption increases, XRP is set to capitalize on its ledger's efficiency, reinforcing its relevance in cross-border transactions.Dogecoin’s price trajectory reflects a history of exponential growth during bullish cycles. Analysts note that DOGE has repeatedly surpassed key Fibonacci levels, and its ongoing symmetrical triangle pattern suggests a breakout may be imminent. With projections placing DOGE at $2.28 or higher, it could rank among the top three assets by market cap. The community-driven nature of DOGE continues to bolster its appeal, ensuring its position as a favorite in the crypto market.Cardano experienced a challenging year with a 9% weekly decline, but its price downtrend shows signs of stabilising. Whale activity has steadied, reducing selling pressure and pointing toward a consolidation phase. The $0.859 support level remains critical for ADA’s recovery, with potential to reclaim $1 in the coming months. Cardano’s innovative blockchain solutions and commitment to scalability make it a long-term contender, even amidst market fluctuations.Rexas Finance (RXS) has reshaped the crypto market through its focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation.

Chinese stocks tumble in worst start to a year since 2016,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-stocks-tumble-in-worst-start-to-a-year-since-2016/articleshow/116880502.cms,"Traders may want to limit China exposure in their portfolios as they position for 2025. (Representative picture)

Chinese stocks posted their worst start to a year in nearly a decade as investors braced for economic uncertainties with weaker-than-expected manufacturing data and an anticipated hike in tariffs.The CSI 300 Index closed down 2.9% on Thursday, its steepest drop on a year’s first day of trading since 2016. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid as much as 3.1%.The losses suggest sentiment remains fragile even after Chinese equities posted their first annual advance last year since 2020. There’s a lack of confidence over the country’s economic recovery, with the Caixin manufacturing survey coming in below estimates and Donald Trump ’s threat of higher tariffs looming large ahead of his inauguration later this month.A sharp fall in the CSI 300 in the last trading session of 2024 also pushed the gauge below the 60-day moving average, a closely-watched technical threshold, likely leading to further selling by some funds. Several large financial stocks including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China traded ex-dividend, exacerbating the benchmarks’ losses.China Stocks Slump on Data, Support Level Breach“It’s a bit troubling that investors are starting the new year in a cautious mode as this is happening after clearer stimulus signals from Beijing during its December policy meetings,” said Homin Lee, senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier. “The underlying momentum for China remains quite fragile, and it will take some efforts from the authorities to change the conversation on the country’s medium-term deflationary dangers.”While Chinese stocks rose 15% last year in a rare annual gain, a bulk of the increase came in the weeks following a late September stimulus blitz. The market has since been trading range-bound, with investors waiting for more significant stimulus to drive the market higher.Following the Central Economic Work Conference in December, China signaled more public borrowing and spending in 2025 with a shift of policy focus to consumption, in an effort to repair the economy’s weak link as looming US tariffs threaten exports.While that announcement has given investors hope that Beijing is determined to revive the economy, some market watchers note that there will be a lull in stimulus until March when the so-called Two Sessions — China’s annual legislative session — take place.Traders may want to limit China exposure in their portfolios as they position for 2025, according to Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.Global funds had already turned net sellers of Chinese stocks in November following two months of net inflows, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note dated December 4. Passive funds turned to outflows after heavy inflows in October while active funds accelerated net outflows in November, they wrote.As economic concerns linger, China’s 10-year bond yields hit a fresh record low on Thursday. The People’s Bank of China injected massive liquidity into the market at the end of 2024 without using high-profile stimulus, as officials preserve policy space before Trump returns to office.Equity trading volume was notable in Hong Kong on Thursday as markets reopened after a holiday, with that for the Hang Seng Index 50% larger than the average over the past 30 sessions. Meanwhile, turnover in Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses has remained below 1.5 trillion yuan ($206 billion) in recent days, suggesting traders are opting to remain on the sidelines until catalysts become clear.“The losses today look very much trading driven, as there was a bit of accumulated gains that would have prompted selling with the breach of technicals,” said Liu Dejun, fund manager at Beijing Kaiyuan Private Fund Management Co. “Many are also talking about avoiding too much stock exposure ahead of Trump’s inauguration, which is close to the Lunar New Year holidays.”","The CSI 300 Index closed down 2.9% on Thursday, its steepest drop on a year’s first day of trading since 2016.

Shiba Inu is one of the trending meme coins, following a 24-hour increase of nearly 4%. While this may seem like a drop from the massive promises that SHIB holds, it’s crucial to note that the SHIB price is coming from a low point of -10.23% in the past month. Similarly, Stellar (XLM) has been on the road to rediscovery after a pause in its growth.However, the Lunex presale has been a success so far, raising over $5.6 million in a few months. The Lunex project has been attracting meme coin investors. Let’s find out why.The SHIB price has been down by about 11% in the past month, with a price of $0.000023 at the time of writing. The dip in the meme coin’s price comes after a massive decline hit the broader crypto market, causing pessimistic Shiba Inu news among investors.Nonetheless, SHIB investors can find solace in its cumulative 113% growth in the past 12 months and get confidence from the coin’s recent bounce back. The SHIB price has gone up by almost 4% in the last 24 hours alone. According to the latest Shiba Inu news, the recent turnaround is a result of the recent post by Elon Musk, which showed a SHIB-like creature hovering over a city.Another coin that has been regaining bullish trends after a period of decline is XLM. Following a year-to-date of over 200%, the XLM price has dropped by nearly 30% in the past month. The drop in the XLM price has caused uncertainty among investors, as there have been sharp price rises and falls.However, a 24-hour surge in the XLM price raises speculation that the token may be regaining momentum. The XLM price has surged by over 4% in the last 24 hours alone. The same applies to the coin’s market cap, which suggested that the Stellar break could be over. However, another sharp fall could be in the offing.While established altcoins like SHIB and XLM have been experiencing a mix of sharp uptrends and downtrends, new altcoins like Lunex have been growing steadily during their presales. For instance, the Lunex price has increased across various levels of its presale and is currently trading at $0.0049. The low Lunex price is a bargain for investors, who are driving the token’s growth in the altcoin market.The interest in the Lunex project stems from the various features that set it apart in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The cross-chain Web3 platform allows the seamless flow of assets across multiple blockchains and over 50,000 crypto pairs. Its non-custodial blockchain operations also make asset exchange faster, cheaper, and more efficient.Moreover, Lunex users can leverage its non-custodial crypto wallet , which helps traders store, manage, and trade over 40,000 digital assets within a single mobile app. Plus, Lunex token holders can earn passive income by staking their assets in the platform’s liquidity pool . With up to 18% APY up for grabs, the staking feature provides a rewarding investment opportunity. There’s also a Lunex reward program, which rewards traders with cashback offers on every transaction they complete on the cross-chain platform .","Shiba Inu is one of the trending meme coins, following a 24-hour increase of nearly 4%.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

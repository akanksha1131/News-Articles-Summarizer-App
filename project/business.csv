Stock market recommendations:Nifty in the last three sessions witnessed a pullback of around 500 points after the sharp decline of 16% in the preceding 5 months as value buying emerged around the key support range of 21,700-22,000. This pullback can be attributed to several factors, including the strength in Asian and European markets, bargain buying in oversold stocks and value buying in blue-chip stocks. The index had been extremely oversold, having declined for 10 consecutive sessions, making the pullback overdue from the deeply oversold zone.Nifty holding above the support area of 21,700-22,000 is expected to extend the pullback towards 22,800 in coming weeks.

We expect the index to extend the consolidation in the coming weeks. Only a breakout or breakdown in any direction will signal the next directional move in the index.A breach below the lower band of the range will lead to extended decline towards 47,000 levels in the coming sessions.

RIL share price : Reliance Industries (RIL) shares have experienced significant decline, dropping 25% from their peak of Rs 1,608.95 on BSE on July 8. Foreign institutional investors ' selling amid retail slowdown and weak refining margins has led to a Rs 5.4 lakh crore erosion in value. The stock's performance has lagged behind Nifty by 10% since January 2024, creating widespread negative sentiment, according to an ET report.Recent trading sessions show a 4% recovery in RIL shares, indicating possible value buying at lower levels. The sustainability of this recovery remains uncertain.Jefferies analysts consider current valuations excessively negative, pointing out that the market capitalisation suggests an enterprise value of $48 billion for RIL's retail division, substantially below the $106 billion valuation from its previous funding round. They anticipate 15% retail growth in FY26, supported by same-store sales growth and expansion.

The company's ARPU growth potential remains strong, considering previous tariff adjustments haven't fully materialised in revenues.Kotak Institutional Equities has elevated their rating to 'Buy' with a Rs 1,400 target price. Despite slight downward revisions in FY26/27 EBITDA forecasts, they project 11% earnings CAGR through FY24-27.

The energy sector has witnessed additional FII withdrawals of Rs 5,000 crore in the past two months.The refining sector faces challenges due to heightened Russian sanctions and US tariff implications. RIL's O2C division continues to experience pressure from weak global refining margins and low petrochemical spreads.RIL's current valuation might present an opportunity, considering the extensive negative sentiment already reflected in prices. The company's underperformance compared to the Nifty indicates thorough pricing of adverse factors. Potential improvement in Jio's performance, retail sector stabilisation, and O2C division recovery could trigger positive revaluation.The recent 4% increase in share price indicates renewed investor interest, though uncertainty remains about whether this represents a sustained recovery or temporary uptick.","Reliance Industries (RIL) shares have experienced significant decline, dropping 25% from their peak of Rs 1,608.95 on BSE on July 8.

Infosys work from office rules: Infosys, the second-largest software services firm in India, has issued a directive on Wednesday requiring its technology staff to comply with the work from office for 10 days monthly mandate, aiming to increase on-campus attendance. Infosys has implemented a new attendance system via a mobile application that mandates employees to be physically present at their designated office locations for at least 10 days monthly. The system will not automatically approve work-from-home requests, according to a senior staff member who requested not to be named.A colleague mentioned this requirement is primarily driven by project needs rather than departmental demands.Department heads at the Bengaluru-based organisation sent emails to their team members, instructing them to restrict their work-from-home requests starting March 10, according to sources who spoke to ET.Also Read | How will Elon Musk-led DOGE’s slashing of federal spending impact Indian IT companies?

These measures are designed to ensure compliance with the new hybrid work requirements while maintaining flexibility for employees.""A senior executive explained that this systematic approach aims to foster better team collaboration whilst maintaining workplace flexibility.The email further said: ""As you know, our hybrid work model expects employees to work from the office for at least 10 days a month, or as per business requirements, whichever is higher.""This directive specifically affects staff at job level 5 (JL5) and below, encompassing team leaders, software engineers, senior engineers, system engineers and consultants.

Stock market today : Indian benchmark indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50 , remained largely unchanged on Friday, following a 2% increase in the previous two sessions. While Reliance Industries showed positive movement, IT stocks declined amid worries about US tariffs and unstable trade policies affecting global markets .The BSE Sensex finished at 74,332.58, down by 7.51 points or 0.01%, whilst the Nifty 50 settled at 22,552.50, up by 7.80 points or 0.03%.The total market value of BSE-listed companies decreased by Rs 697 crore to Rs 398.26 lakh crore.Technology stocks faced pressure, with the IT index dropping 0.9%, as these companies generate substantial revenue from the US market. Major tech firms Infosys and HCL Technologies saw declines exceeding 1.6%.Reliance Industries, ranking second in market weight among index constituents, recorded a 3% increase, leading gains across both indices.The automobile sector index concluded marginally higher by 0.1%, surrendering earlier gains. CLSA indicated that potential removal of import duties on US vehicles would not significantly affect Indian car manufacturers.In specific stock movements, Bharat Electronics gained 1.5% after receiving orders worth Rs 577 crore, whilst Gensol Engineering continued its downward trend for the eighth straight session, falling 2.5% following credit rating downgrades by CARE and ICRA.The property sector index Nifty Realty fell by 1.2%, with prominent developers like Godrej Properties, Lodha, Prestige Estates, and Raymond seeing declines of 2-3%.The previous two trading sessions had witnessed the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex rise approximately 2% each, supported by positive sentiment regarding potential US tariff reductions on Canadian and Mexican imports, lower oil prices, and value buying following recent market declines.Following Indian trading hours on Thursday, US President Donald Trump declared the suspension of 25% tariffs on the majority of Mexican and Canadian imports, further complicating an already unpredictable trade policy that has disrupted international financial markets.Investors maintained a cautious stance whilst awaiting crucial US employment statistics and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's address.Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, noted that global markets face significant uncertainty due to US tariff implementations and retaliatory threats from trading partners.

Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats have added volatility to global stock markets, with India emerging as a key player in the US president’s trade realignment strategy.India put a 9.5% tariff on US goods, while the US imposes just 3% on Indian products. As reciprocal tariffs loom, industries like automobiles, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and steel are at risk. Despite a short rally this week, the Nifty remains down 14% from its peak, with smallcaps in bear market territory. Over $15 billion has been pulled out by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in 2025 alone.Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have maintained their selling trend in Indian equities this March, with total equity outflows reaching Rs 24,753 crore as of March 7, bringing the year-to-date total to Rs 1,37,354 crore in CY25, according to ET report.India is particularly vulnerable to tariff hikes, with key sectors facing significant threats. The Indian Rupee has weakened, and foreign investment is retreating due to concerns about a slowdown.Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets said that India’s automobile, pharmaceutical, textiles, and steel sectors could face severe impacts. However, India’s diplomatic approach—focused on trade negotiations and tariff rationalization—could help mitigate risks. YES Securities suggests reducing tariffs on US imports like steel and encouraging American companies like Tesla to enter India, which could serve as leverage against potential retaliatory tariffs.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, explains that markets perceive Trump’s moves as temporary negotiations rather than long-term tariff impositions, acknowledging that sustained tariffs could hurt the US economy. In response, China and Germany have already implemented domestic stimulus measures to counterbalance the effects of Trump’s policies, adding another layer of complexity to the global economic landscapeThe pharmaceutical sector, which holds 35% of the US market, faces short-term challenges but may benefit in the long term due to India’s competitive advantage over China. Amisha Vora, Chairperson & MD of PL Group, emphasized that despite tariff concerns, India remains more competitive than China, which faces a 20% tariff. Sandip Sabharwal, a market expert, pointed out that large-cap pharma stocks like Sun Pharma and Lupin have already experienced sell-offs but remain well-positioned unless tariffs escalate significantly.Despite global uncertainties, Indian markets show resilience. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, noted that India’s markets have remained strong despite equity outflows from emerging markets.Amisha Vora sees the current dip as an investment opportunity. “With ongoing reforms and India’s demographic advantage, the market will likely perform better, even amidst trade wars,” Vora told ET suggesting a potential correction of 4-5% in the short term.","Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats have added volatility to global stock markets.

NEW DELHI: The government has lifted the export ban on broken rice to promote its shipments. The ban was imposed in September 2022.""Export policy of broken rice has been amended from prohibited to free with immediate effect,"" the Directorate General of Foreign Trade has said in a notification.Exporters have earlier urged the government to permit the shipments due to the rise in inventories.Last year, the government removed the minimum export price (MEP) of USD 490 per tonne on overseas shipments of non-basmati white rice and withdrew a blanket ban on the shipments of this variety.These measures came at a time when the country has ample rice stock at government godowns and retail prices are also under control.The export restriction was imposed as the Russia-Ukraine war had disrupted the foodgrain supply chain.Though there was a ban on exports, the government allowed the shipments to friendly and needy countries on a request basis.In 2023-24, India exported broken rice worth $194.58 million to countries like Gambia, Benin, Senegal and Indonesia. It was $983.46 million in 2022-23 and $1.13 billion in 2021-22.","The export restriction was imposed as the Russia-Ukraine war had disrupted the foodgrain supply chain.

India always puts own interest first in talks with a country: FM

MUMBAI: On the heels of the income tax cut announced in the Union Budget , finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said a reduction in goods and services tax ( GST ) is in the offing, but remained tight-lipped on reduction in capital gains tax, citing resumption of the Parliament session next week.In a fireside chat at The Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence, Sitharaman said work on rationalising GST rates was almost complete. ""I have personally taken it upon myself to review the committees' work and take it to the GST Council for a final decision. We are very close to making some critical decisions on rate reductions and number of slabs,"" she said. ""I have been clear rates will come down. When GST was launched, the revenue-neutral rate was 15.8%. Since then, it has come down to 11.4%... There is no item for which GST rate has increased. In fact, it has gone down, and we will continue this trend.""We must stop running down our own country. If we keep focusing on negative aspects, we won’t move forward. We need to understand that India is the fastest-growing country, despite the challenges. We cannot afford to live in the past; we must embrace the present and future. We need to build confidence in our growth, trust in our systems, and encourage optimism,” Sitharaman said.Regarding trade negotiations with the US, she said while her colleague Piyush Goyal was overseeing the talks, “both sides should aim for a good treaty”. Sitharaman pointed out that challenges like geo-economic fragmentation and tariff wars also presented opportunities for India. Sitharaman also underscored India’s approach to trade agreements, highlighting that “India’s guiding principle in negotiations with any country is always putting India’s interest first”.“I won't shy away from saying that some of the bilateral agreements signed earlier — whether with individual countries or groups — were either negotiated too hastily or contained loose language.

If we keep focusing on negative aspects, we won’t move forward. We need to understand that India is the fastest-growing country, despite the challenges.

Sitharaman pointed out that challenges like geo-economic fragmentation and tariff wars also presented opportunities for India. Sitharaman also underscored India’s approach to trade agreements, highlighting that “India’s guiding principle in negotiations with any country is always putting India’s interest first”.“I won't shy away from saying that some of the bilateral agreements signed earlier — whether with individual countries or groups — were either negotiated too hastily or contained loose language.

India Inc is striving to reimagine workplaces, championing inclusivity, diversity, and gender parity in a highly disruptive, tech-driven world to spark a pink edge.Companies are ramping up efforts to attract and retain women talent with targeted leadership programmes, cutting-edge AI upskilling, and enhanced flexibility that nurtures work-life balance. In this drive for a more equitable environment, equal opportunities have taken center stage - eclipsing salary and benefits as a defining priority for women-signaling a shift toward cultures that prioritise growth, fairness, and purpose.In the post-pandemic return-to-office (RTO) era, flexibility has become a lifeline for women balancing professional and personal demands. Over half of Indian employees - 52% - would leave a job lacking sufficient flexibility, according to Randstad Workmonitor Survey 2025. Women tend to place more importance on work-life balance, it adds.Viswanath P S, MD & CEO of Randstad India, a talent company, says, ""Women are actively seeking greater flexibility, meaningful career development, and upskilling opportunities, particularly in AI and emerging technologies. The demand for full-time remote work is also significantly higher among women.""A bunch of companies including TCS and Accenture offer flexible work options, while some like Meesho include hybrid work policies to promote better work-life balance.Govindraj M K, CHRO at Myntra, says, ""We provide additional flexibility through our MynVive: Myntra Ramp-back Programme, which offers new mothers and primary caregivers options offering extended flexibility, such as sabbatical leave for up to 24 weeks and the option to work at 50% capacity for three months post-maternity.""However, many companies are insisting on a strict return to office. Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder TeamLease, cautions, ""The result will be that organisations that embrace AI to enable personalised learning, hybrid work and career paths, and flexible working will be able to attract and retain the best female talent.""As industries adapt to tech advancements, the demand for skills that align with innovation and adaptability has never been higher. As AI (artificial intelligence) and automation disrupt sectors, the workforce needs to be equipped with new tools to stay ahead of the curve. Yet, there is still a considerable gap in terms of availability, coverage, and quality.Nishchae Suri, MD-India, Cornerstone OnDemand, says, ""As AI continues to transform industries, investing in targeted upskilling programmes for women is essential to cultivate an inclusive, agile workforce.""Encouragingly, job opportunities for women in India have surged by 48% in 2025, with notable growth in emerging tech fields.However, to fully harness this potential, organisations must address persistent upskilling gaps. Chakraborty says, ""Most AI training programmes are not targeted at specific issues that women face, such as the lack of mentors in tech and biased skill tests. The attention should move to the development of career acceleration programmes that are available to all women, free from bias, and in line with their work preferences.""Flexible work models, structured career re-entry programmes, and targeted Learning & Development (L&D) and upskilling must anchor talent management for women employees, equipping them to navigate the future of work with resilience & agility.","Over half of Indian employees - 52% - would leave a job lacking sufficient flexibility, according to Randstad Workmonitor Survey 2025.

MUMBAI: The rupee finished the week on a strong note, closing at Rs 86.87 against US dollar, up 24 paise from the previous day's Rs 87.11. This represented its best weekly performance in over two years, rising 0.7% week-on-week, as the dollar weakened against most major currencies.The greenback was on track for its worst week in more than two years, under pressure from concerns over the US economy's slowdown and ongoing uncertainties about tariff policies. The euro's rally, boosted by the European Central Bank's hawkish rate cut and surging German bond yields, also contributed to the dollar's decline.The dollar index fell by over 3.5%, with euro reaching its highest point against dollar since Nov 2024.

JAMMU: Chief minister Omar Abdullah on Friday presented a Rs 1.12-lakh crore budget for 2025-26, the first by an elected government in J&K in seven years, as he heaped praise on PM Narendra Modi, promised all-round growth and ladled out a salad of sops for disadvantaged groups.Terming the document a roadmap for growth and a true reflection of people’s aspirations, Omar said J&K was at the cusp of a new era of peace and prosperity, with a semblance of normality returning after over 30 years of turmoil.Attired in a traditional suit and a skull cap, Omar started his 90-minute budget speech in the assembly in English, with a Persian couplet “Tan Hama Daag Daag Shud–Punmba Kuja Kuja Neham (my entire body is covered with bruises, where should I apply the balm)” amid thumping of benches by legislators of his National Conference (NC).The last budget was tabled in 2018 under the then PDP-BJP govt in the erstwhile state of J&K, which was accorded Union Territory status following the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019.Omar, who has retained the finance portfolio with himself, also praised Union home minister Amit Shah and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman for support in various areas. He said the improved environment was contributing to progress, with J&K’s economy expanding from Rs 1,64,103 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 2,45,022 crore in 2023-24. “GDP for 2025-26 is projected at Rs 2,884,22 crore, reflecting a growth of 9.5% over the previous year,” Omar added.Revealing other key fiscal indicators, the CM pegged the tax-GDP ratio at 7.5% for 2025-26 and fiscal deficit at 3% of J&K’s GDP. “This is substantially lower than 5.5% in 2024-25 (RE). Expected revenue receipts are Rs 97,982 crore and capital receipts Rs 14,328 crore. Similarly, revenue expenditure is estimated to be Rs 79,703 crore and capital expenditure Rs 32,607 crore,” the CM said, focusing on a zero-deficit revenue account budget.An additional Rs 41,000 crore is to flow as central assistance and Rs 13,522 crore as centrally sponsored schemes and Prime Minister’s Development Package (PMDP). “J&K continues to face significant infrastructure deficits. I met Prime Minister (Modi), home minister (Shah), and finance minister (Sitaraman) on multiple occasions. Our efforts have paid off -- the central govt has approved special assistance for J&K and will support fiscal reforms to enhance revenue and expenditure management,” Omar said.Marriage assistance for women under the AAY category will be raised from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Omar topped this up with free bus rides for women. “On International Women’s Day (March 8), I will announce free ridership for women on all govt-owned transport, including e-buses, starting April 1, 2025. This will enhance access to education and employment while ensuring safer, more affordable travel,” the CM said.Marriage assistance for women under the AAY category will be raised from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Omar topped this up with free bus rides for women from April to “enhance access to education and employment while ensuring safer, more affordable travel”.Pensions have been enhanced to Rs 1,250 per month for people above 60yrs, Rs 1,500 for those between 60 and 80, and Rs 2,000 per month for those aged 80 and above. The payouts were last fixed at Rs 1,000 in 2016.Buoyed by record-breaking 2.36 crore tourist footfalls in 2024, Omar unveiled a slew of initiatives for the sector. “Tourism’s contribution to GSDP will be increased from 7% to 15% in 4-5 years,” the CM said.Omar’s rivals were not persuaded. PDP said the budget exposed the “gap” between the promises Omar’s NC had made during assembly elections last year and the reality of its governance. BJP dismissed it as a “complete failure”.By limiting the food and free power benefits only to AAY ration card holders, the govt has excluded a vast majority of the state’s population, PDP argued. Peoples’ Conference chief Sajad Lone described the budget as a “disappointment”. “Same old style of parroting of centrally sponsored schemes with Hindi nomenclature,” Lone said.(With inputs from agencies)","Chief minister Omar Abdullah presented a Rs 1.12-lakh crore budget for 2025-26.

MEERUT : A 21-year-old Dalit woman who was allegedly raped by an upper caste man in August 2023 was later forced to ""settle"" the matter at a panchayat and paid Rs 2.5 lakh to remain silent.But that was not the end of her ordeal.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Friday claimed that India has agreed to cut down tariffs adding that ""somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done."" Earlier today, the ministry of external affairs had addressed the tariff threat but made no comments on whether there was any decision on reducing the charges.""India charges us massive tariffs.

India currently imposes vehicle import duties of up to 110%, a rate Tesla CEO Elon Musk has condemned as among the highest in the world. The steep tariffs previously led Tesla to abandon its plans to enter India's automobile market, which ranks as the third-largest globally.Justifying the tariff threat being levied on Canada, China, Mexico and India, set to take effect from April 2, Trump said, ""Our country has been ripped off by everybody and that stops now. I had it stopped in my first term and we're going to really stop it now because it has been very unfair. Our country from an economic standpoint, a financial standpoint and a trade standpoint, has been absolutely ripped off by almost every country in the world.""India has resorted to a cautious route in the trade war, while Canada, China and Mexico have gone all out with slapping reciprocal tariffs on the US and filing complaints with the World Trade Organisation.""The two governments are in the process of advancing discussions on a multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement.

Britain's finance minister, Rachel Reeves , has called for urgent reforms to the country's welfare system, citing concerns that it is ""costing too much"" as the nation grapples with high inflation and rising borrowing.Reeves is expected to announce significant cuts to welfare spending in her upcoming Spring Statement on March 26, following her inaugural budget in October.The government's fiscal position has been further strained by global challenges, including US tariffs and the ongoing war in Ukraine, leading to a depletion of the Labour administration's £9.9 billion ($12.7 billion) financial cushion, news agency AFP reported.In an interview on Sky News' Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Reeves said, ""We have to reform our welfare system because, right now, it's letting down taxpayers. It's costing too much and isn't effectively helping those it should.""She emphasized the need for a system that does more than provide benefits, aiming instead to support people back into employment. ""We need to get better value for money from taxpayers' contributions,"" she added.Any reforms could potentially conflict with the finance minister's self-imposed fiscal rules, which prevent borrowing for day-to-day spending.

Walgreens to be bought by private equity firm Sycamore Partners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/struggling-retailer-walgreens-to-be-acquired-by-sycamore-partners-in-10-billion-deal/articleshow/118777523.cms,"

Walgreens Boots Alliance has been acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal worth nearly $10 billion, as the retailer seeks to turn around its fortunes after years of financial difficulties but still couldn't do it.Announcing the deal on Thursday, the pharmacy company said Sycamore would pay $11.45 per share, with the potential for shareholders to receive an additional $3 per share under certain conditions. The agreement would take the company private, allowing it to restructure its business away from the pressures of Wall Street. Tim Wentworth, Walgreens Boots Alliance CEO said, “Throughout our history, Walgreens Boots Alliance has played a critical role in the retail healthcare ecosystem. We are focused on making healthcare delivery more effective, convenient and affordable as we navigate the challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape.""The CEO further added that Sycamore will provide the company with the expertise and experience of a partner with a strong track record of successful retail turnarounds.The buyout deal values Walgreens at almost $24 billion when including debt, and Sycamore’s offer represents a nearly 30 per cent premium on its share price from December, when reports of a possible sale first surfaced.Walgreens has also been working to boost its finances, including suspending its quarterly dividend, ending a 90-year streak, and reducing its stake in drug distributor Cencora to free up cash for debt repayment.Ultimately, improving cash flow remains a top priority, whether the company stays public or goes private. ""Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan,"" Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny noted in a February report.Founded in 1901, Walgreens has been a public company since 1927 but has faced growing challenges in recent years, due to low prescription reimbursement rates, rising costs, increasing theft, and price-sensitive customers shifting to cheaper alternatives. The company already began a restructuring process, including plans to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 US stores. This follows a previous downsizing, which saw it reduce its store count after acquiring parts of Rite Aid in 2018.Beyond store closures, Walgreens has been reviewing its US healthcare operations, including a potential sale of its VillageMD clinic business, which it had aggressively expanded. This move comes after the company’s shares lost nearly two-thirds of their value in 2023.Walgreens operates nearly 3,700 international stores in the UK, Mexico, Thailand, and Ireland. The buyout comes at a time of major shifts in the industry, with rival Rite Aid recently emerging from bankruptcy as a private company, while competitors like CVS, Walmart, and Kroger continue to dominate the US pharmacy market.","Walgreens Boots Alliance has been acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal worth nearly $10 billion.

The US market, which was already on the edge over US tariffs and economic uncertainty, suffered massive lows as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 427 points (1 per cent) to 42,579.08, while the Nasdaq fell 483.48 points to 18,069.26, 2.6 per cent down at the end of the day.The S&P 500 index slid 1.8 per cent or 104.11 points to 5,738.52, resuming its recent downturn after a brief recovery spell the previous day.Stocks kept falling despite US President Donald Trump's decision to delay the 25 per cent tariff on Mexican, Canadian and Chinese imports for one month. Investors found little relief, though concerns persisted over whether Trump is using tariffs as a negotiation strategy or if an extended trade war is unavoidable.Despite hopes for a softer stance, Trump is still pressing ahead with additional tariffs set to take effect on 2nd April. The constant back-and-forth tariff imposition has also fuelled the market uncertainty as earlier.Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management said, “These exemptions don’t do much to resolve the general air of uncertainty.” He further added that businesses will continue to opt for a cautious stance in the current scenario until the tariff picture is clear.US firms are already struggling with the instability, while consumers brace for rising prices.All eyes are now on the US jobs report, a key indicator of economic health. So far, strong hiring and consumer spending have helped prevent a recession, and economists expected hiring to ramp up in February.However, some major retailers are flashing warning signs.

It also issued a weaker profit outlook for 2025, sending its shares down 0.7 per cent.Victoria’s Secret followed a similar path, beating Q4 estimates but forecasting disappointing revenue for the year ahead, which caused its stock to plunge 8.2 per cent.Some of Wall Street's biggest tech firms are also falling.Chipmakers, which soared in recent years due to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, also took a heavy hit. Marvell Technology fell almost 20 per cent despite recording better-than-expected earnings and predicting over 60 per cent revenue growth this quarter. Even Nvidia, the face of the AI revolution, fell 5.7 per cent, while Broadcom slid 6.3 per cent ahead of its earnings release.These firms are also facing increasing competition with Chinese companies ramping up their own AI development.European markets showed mixed results after the European Central Bank cut interest rates as expected. Germany’s DAX rose 1.5 per cent, while shares across Asia also gained, including a 3.3 per cent jump in Hong Kong and a 1.2 per cent rise in Shanghai.In the bond market, the 10-year US Treasury yield edged up slightly to 4.29 per cent from 4.28 per cent on Wednesday.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 427 points (1 per cent) to 42,579.08.

The US trade deficit widened to a record in January as companies scrambled to secure goods from overseas before President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on America's largest trading partners.The gap in goods and services trade widened 34% from the prior month to $131.4 billion, commerce department data showed on Thursday.

Dollar rally may lose steam as tariffs hurt consumption: S&P,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dollar-rally-may-lose-steam-as-tariffs-hurt-consumption-sp/articleshow/118771020.cms,"Photo/Agencies

MUMBAI: The US dollar may have run out of steam, with weaker economic data resulting in a decline in the dollar index. More weakness may be forthcoming as the announced tariffs will push up prices, reduce spending, and hit growth in the US.""The reversal of the dollar index in the last two-three weeks has been in parallel with the weakened data that has been coming up. When weaker data comes up, the view of what the Fed might do changes towards a more easing bias which in turn leads to less of a pressure on foreign exchange,"" said Satyam Panday, chief economist US & Canada at S&P. He was speaking at Crisil's India outlook event.According to Panday, the US outperformance narrative is probably not going to hold this year, going by the impact of tariffs. ""Without getting into the issue of reciprocal tariffs, the tariffs that have already been implemented - Canada, Mexico and the Chinese tariffs, back of the envelope calculation indicate a 60-70-basis-point price rise impact on the basket. If you look at the marginal propensity to consume you would probably see a 20-30 basis points impact on consumer spending .""According to D K Joshi, chief economist at Crisil, every time the rupee has fallen sharply from its trend rate of depreciation, it has been followed by an appreciation or a long period of stability.""Our forecast of the rupee-dollar exchange rate for March 2025 was at 87 and for March 2026, it was mild depreciation leading up to 88. I between I think there will be volatility but beyond that, this is our projection,"" said Joshi. ""We are going through the volatile phase right now, where you'll see ups and downs in currency. But if it depreciates too much it will also appreciate.""According to Joshi, the outflow of capital now has nothing to do with the interest rate differential but with uncertainty, because of which money was going back to its home market.","The reversal of the dollar index in the last two-three weeks has been in parallel with the weakened data that has been coming up.

"Trump wants India to lower tariffs on autos, but do Harley and Tesla really need them?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-wants-india-to-lower-tariffs-on-autos-but-do-harley-and-tesla-really-need-them/articleshow/118767003.cms,"US President Donald Trump (File Photo-AP)

NEW DELHI: Ironic as it may sound, but while US President Donald Trump pushes for lower import duty on Tesla cars and the iconic Harley-Davidson motorcycles when they come in to India, but neither of the two companies currently source them from America and rather prefer to get them from factories in other countries.While Harley is importing its bikes from its mega manufacturing set-up in Thailand, Tesla – which is close to launching its cars in India – will also not be shipping the electrics from the US, but rather from its factory in Germany (India has requested the company not to import from China).This, industry officials say, clearly brings out the fact that while there is noise and complaints from the new US administration regarding high duties on autos in India, American companies do not see the need to import fully-built products, or even semi- or completely-knocked down kits, from the US.Companies find it better and beneficial to use other manufacturing countries due to locational advantages (that saves freight as well as time when importing to India) or because of economies of scale.For example, look at the business case of Harley-Davidson motorcycles even after the govt decided to cut duty on imported bikes in the just-announced Union Budget. The Budget had slashed the customs duty on fully-built bikes bigger than 1600cc from 50% to 30%, while for SKD (semi-knocked down) kits, it came down from 25% to 20% and for CKD (completely-knocked down) from 15% to 10%. And for bikes with engines smaller than 1600cc, the customs duty was reduced from 50% to 40% for fully-built ones, while on SKDs from 25% to 20%, and on CKDs from 15% to 10%.Despite this, Harley – which makes only the 440cc model (called X440) in India in partnership with Hero Moto -- prefers to get the other models them from Thailand, instead of using its US factories. “There is a mega set-up in Thailand that the company uses to get its bikes to India. Beyond the 440cc that it makes here, all the other bikes – including bigger ones like Pan America, Nightster, Street Glide and Fat Bob -- are being imported from Thailand,” an analyst specializing in foreign trade told TOI.Interestingly, Harley imports its bikes to India at zero duty due to trade agreements between the two countries. “So even if India reduces the duty on imported bikes from the US to zero, Harley will still find it beneficial to get them from Thailand. This is because Thailand is closer to India and so the freight cost will be lower and products can reach faster,” another analyst said.","US President Donald Trump pushes for lower import duty on Tesla cars and the iconic Harley-Davidson motorcycles.

"European central bank cuts interest rates amid looming trade war, growth concern",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/european-central-bank-cuts-interest-rates-amid-looming-trade-war-growth-concern/articleshow/118765117.cms,"European Central Bank (Photo-AP)

The European central bank (ECB) reduced interest rates by 25 basis point on Thursday, aiming to stimulate economic activity as the eurozone grapples with sluggish growth.This move, which lowers borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, comes amid mounting concerns about the impact of potential trade conflicts with the US and rising defence spending.The ECB’s decision to cut its benchmark deposit rate to 2.5% is aimed at supporting the economy by making it cheaper to borrow for investment and consumption. The bank previously raised rates to a record 4% in response to inflation peaking at 10.6% in October 2022, but has been easing rates since June as inflation has since moderated to 2.4%, according to AP report.Despite the decline in inflation, growth remains a pressing concern for the 20 nations using the euro. The eurozone’s economy showed zero growth in the final quarter of 2024, and the outlook for 2025 is uncertain due to shifting dynamics in global trade and the possibility of heightened defence spending.ECB President Christine Lagarde , speaking after the meeting, emphasized that the rate cut would make borrowing conditions “meaningfully less restrictive” for the economy.She cautioned that the central bank was not committing to a specific rate trajectory going forward, acknowledging the complexities presented by global trade tensions and increased government spending.As economic uncertainty continues, Lagarde noted that increased defence and infrastructure spending could spur growth, but growing global trade tensions—particularly with the US—pose a major challenge to inflation expectations in the eurozone.Economists, including Carsten Brzeski from ING Bank, pointed out that with increasing uncertainty and the possibility of large fiscal stimulus, the ECB’s future rate path is unclear. ""A pause at the next meeting to reassess the economic landscape seems likely,"" said Brzeski.The new fiscal realities in Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy, have added another layer of complexity. A new government coalition has agreed to loosen budget restrictions to allow for significantly more borrowing, potentially injecting up to a trillion euros into defence and other sectors over the next decade. This shift in fiscal policy could stimulate growth, but may also lead to increased inflationary pressures.Meanwhile, concerns are rising about US President Trump's potential new tariffs on European goods, which could further hinder growth in the export-driven eurozone economy . The looming trade war adds another layer of uncertainty for businesses already wary of inflation and political shifts.Despite these challenges, some analysts, like Julien Lafargue of Barclays Private Bank, expect the ECB to remain flexible, making future decisions based on incoming economic data. The central bank faces a delicate balancing act: boosting growth while managing inflationary risks, with external pressures such as US tariffs potentially complicating this task.","ECB reduced interest rates by 25 basis point on Thursday.

Trump tariffs: Is China really ready for a trade war with US?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-tariffs-is-china-really-ready-for-a-trade-war-with-us/articleshow/118763757.cms,"Fight

Driving the news

""If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.""

Why it matters

It isn’t just trade. The competing agendas of the leaders of the world’s two largest economies are poised to lead to precisely what China is trying to avoid: a superpower clash not seen since the Cold War, an all-encompassing rivalry over economic, technological and overall geopolitical supremacy. An article in the WSJ

China’s countermeasures

Is China really ready for a trade war against US?

What they’re saying

Trump’s trade advisers: “The US can no longer afford to let China dictate global trade rules. We are reclaiming our economic independence.”

Michael Pillsbury, China expert: “They are kind of desperate. Their economy is in trouble. Now that Trump put the tariffs on, they know this campaign [to avoid them] has failed.”

Chinese officials: “Xi believes that must be avoided,” said a person who consults Beijing, referring to the risk of Soviet-style isolation.

US defense secretary Pete Hegseth : “Those who long for peace must prepare for war. We are strengthening our military to deter China’s aggression.”

Trump’s strategy

Even though Trump may be the one who currently looks isolated on the world stage—picking trade fights with erstwhile allies like Mexico and Canada, alarming Europe over his handling of the war in Ukraine and vowing to annex Greenland and the Panama Canal—the truth is that China doesn’t hold a strong hand. An article in the WSJ

US leverage play

Trump is not stopping at tariffs. His administration is weighing additional measures to tighten restrictions on Chinese investment in the US, limit US companies’ business operations in China, and impose stricter export controls on high-tech goods.

Trump’s team also sees an opportunity to reshape global trade by striking deals with other nations before negotiating with China. The US has been in talks with Mexico, Vietnam, and India to strengthen trade relations and prevent China from using third countries as a backdoor into the US market.

The stakes extend beyond trade. Washington’s push to decouple key industries from China, restrict technology transfers, and rally partners against Beijing’s economic practices suggests a long-term strategy of containment. If successful, these moves could erode China’s ability to sustain high-growth levels, advance its technological ambitions, and project power internationally.

Between the lines

Trump’s trade war is as much about politics as it is about economics. He is betting that his tough stance on China will rally his base, reinforcing his image as a fighter against unfair trade practices.

For China, the challenge is existential. Xi Jinping is determined to avoid the fate of the Soviet Union, which collapsed under economic pressure from the US and its allies. That means China is likely to double down on efforts to insulate itself from US influence—whether through technological self-sufficiency, expanded trade partnerships, or military posturing.

The bottom line: The US-China trade war is entering a new, more intense phase. Trump believes he has the upper hand and is willing to let China “stew” in economic distress until it concedes to US demands, the WSJ report said.","The US-China trade war is entering a new, more intense phase.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

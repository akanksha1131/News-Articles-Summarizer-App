Stock market recommendations:

According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 7, 2025 are Manappuram Finance, and Dabur India. Here’s its view on Nifty and Bank Nifty:

Index View: NIFTY

The recent breakout region, which previously acted as a resistance and now is likely to provide support.

The 50% Fibonacci retracement of the preceding upswing from 24,587 to 26,104, indicating a potential mean-reversion zone.

The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently placed near the 25,325 mark, further reinforcing the area’s significance as a near-term floor for the index.

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in a range for the third week in a row after hitting an all-time high of 58577.

Going ahead, index to extend consolidation of the last two weeks in the range of 57300-58500 thus forming base after the next leg of up move.

A close below 57300 will open downside towards the key support area of 56,800–56,500. On the higher key resistance is placed at recent all time high of 58,577. A move above the same will open further upside towards 59,000 being the 138.2% Fibonacci projection of the recent correction (57,628–53,561).

Overall, the outlook remains positive, and current pullbacks should be viewed as buying opportunities within these support areas. PSU Banking stocks to extend the recent outperformance

Benchmark indices extended its corrective consolidation for the third week in a row. Investors stayed on the sidelines, tracking developments on US–China and US–India trade negotiations. India’s economic fundamentals stayed strong, supported by a robust manufacturing & service PMI and steady GST collections, indicating healthy growth momentum in the economy.Over the past ten trading sessions, the Nifty has undergone a corrective retracement of approximately 600 points, effectively unwinding the overbought readings that had emerged on the daily stochastic oscillator following a sharp 1,500-point rally over the preceding four weeks. This measured pullback should be viewed as a healthy consolidation within the broader uptrend rather than the onset of a major reversal. We recommend utilizing this phase as an opportunity to accumulate quality large-cap and sectoral leaders in a staggered manner, keeping a short- to medium-term investment horizon.Technically, the index is now approaching a crucial demand zone between 25,500 and 25,300, which is expected to act as a strong support base. This zone coincides with multiple technical confluences:From a price structure perspective, the medium-term trend remains constructive as long as the index sustains above this pivotal support band.A decisive formation of a higher high and higher low will signal a pause in the current decline and open pullback towards immediate resistance of 25,850. Beyond this, the 26,100 level, which represents the twin highs of the past two weeks, would serve as the next key resistance and potential trigger for a renewed leg higher.The stock remains in steady up trend forming higher high and higher low in the long-term chart. The entire up move of CY25 is well channelled signaling sustained demand at elevated levels.The stock has strong support at 260-258 levels being the confluence of the key retracement and 144 days EMA.We expect the stock to head towards the recent all time high placed at 298 in the coming month.The stock has witnessed a steady pullback post its quarterly numbers and is currently placed above its short- and medium-term averages.We expect the stock to extend its current pullback and head towards 567 levels in the coming month being the trendline resistance joining recent highs.Immediate support is placed at 500-490 levels being the confluence of key retracement and trendline support joining recent lows. The daily 14 periods RSI is in buy mode thus supports the positive bias.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 7, 2025 are Manappuram Finance, and Dabur India.

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth

How Musk could receive the $1 trillion









Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved Elon Musk’s multibillion-dollar pay package, giving the CEO a pathway to earn as much as $1 trillion if he delivers on a set of long-term performance targets. More than 75% of shareholders backed the plan at Thursday’s meeting, and the announcement was met with cheers.""What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,"" Musk told the audience when he took the stage.The package is designed to keep Musk at Tesla long enough to pursue the technological goals he has set for the company. Musk has said Tesla’s progress in areas such as artificial intelligence, self-driving technology and robotics will put it ahead of competitors. If Musk meets all the targets in the plan, he could become the world’s first trillionaire.Musk currently has a net worth of more than $500 billion and is listed as the world’s richest person on Forbes’ real-time billionaire rankings. Under the approved plan, he must meet various milestones linked to Tesla’s market value to receive the full package. The first part becomes available when Tesla reaches a $2 trillion market value.The package also includes goals tied to operating profit and product launches, such as delivering 20 million Tesla vehicles. The plan is structured to keep Musk at Tesla for at least seven and a half years.Musk has said Tesla’s growth potential is significant, stating in July that ""Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world by far"" if the company meets its goals for autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.Musk will only receive the payout if he achieves the required operational and financial goals.The targets include delivering 20 million vehicles within 10 years. This is more than twice the number Tesla has produced in the past 12 years. He must also increase the company’s market value and operating profits, and oversee the delivery of one million robots. Tesla has not delivered any robots yet.Even if Musk does not reach every goal, he could still receive a large payout. He will get $50 billion in Tesla shares if he raises the company’s market value by 80%, doubles vehicle sales and triples operating profit — or meets any two of the other operational targets.","More than 75% of shareholders backed the plan at Thursday’s meeting.

T





US President Donald Trump has directed the justice department to investigate major meatpacking companies for alleged collusion and price manipulation amid record-high beef prices.In a post on Truth Social, Trump accused meat firms of “driving up the price of beef through illicit collusion, price fixing, and price manipulation,” saying he had ordered an immediate inquiry.Attorney general Pam Bondi confirmed on X that the investigation was under way, led by agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins and assistant attorney General Gail Slater, who heads the department’s antitrust division.The probe will examine whether leading processors have engaged in practices that distort market competition.According to, Tyson Foods, Cargill, JBS USA, and National Beef Packing Company together process about 85% of US grain-fed cattle, which supply steaks and beef cuts across the country.The justice department has not named any specific targets so far.Beef prices have reached new highs in 2025, fuelled by droughts that damaged pasturelands and raised feed costs, forcing ranchers to cut the national herd to its smallest in nearly 75 years.Data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics showed the retail price of ground chuck beef at $6.33 per pound in September, up 13.5% from last year.Despite soaring costs, consumer demand has remained strong.Rollins said on X, “We need transparency, accountability, and a fair market that rewards those who actually raise and produce our beef — not the corporate middlemen gaming the system.”The Meat Institute, which represents major processors, rejected the claims, arguing the industry is “heavily regulated” and “market transactions are transparent.”Its CEO, Julie Anna Potts, said that despite high retail prices, “beef packers have been losing money because the price of cattle is at record highs”, reported Reuters.Trump’s move came days after Republican losses in elections dominated by concerns over the rising cost of living.He said the action aims to “protect our American ranchers” from “majority foreign-owned meat packers who artificially inflate prices and jeopardise national food security.”The justice department’s antitrust division can issue subpoenas and pursue both civil and criminal investigations into anti-competitive conduct.Slater, a former adviser to Vice President JD Vance, has said her office will focus on “pocketbook issues” like food, housing, and transport.Industry consolidation has long drawn criticism from ranchers. Advocacy group R-CALF USA said the sector’s concentration is “well beyond the level normally considered a harm to the economy.”The companies involved have previously paid millions to settle price-fixing lawsuits but denied wrongdoing.he investigation follows Trump’s previous call to lower beef prices by increasing imports from Argentina — a suggestion that angered ranchers, according to news agency AFP.The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said the move could “undercut the future of family farmers and ranchers.”","US President Donald Trump orders investigation into meatpacking companies.

Mobile users will soon start seeing the names of unknown callers displayed on their phone screens, as telecom operators have begun testing the Calling Name Presentation (CNAP) service in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.The feature aims to help users identify callers more easily and curb the rising number of spam and scam calls across the country.According to an ET report, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) directed operators to start proof-of-concept trials before introducing CNAP nationwide.The system will automatically show the caller’s registered name, not just their number, when an incoming call is received.This is expected to reduce impersonation cases, where callers pose as representatives of other entities or use fake identities.During the pilot phase, Reliance Jio , Vodafone Idea, and BSNL are testing the service from the Haryana circle, while Bharti Airtel is conducting its trials from Himachal Pradesh.The name of the caller will only appear if the person holds a mobile connection registered in one of these circles.For example, if a Haryana or Himachal subscriber calls someone elsewhere in India, their name will be displayed on the recipient’s screen, provided the number is not already saved.The CNAP feature uses the information submitted by subscribers in their customer acquisition forms at the time of connection.It will be a default service once fully rolled out. However, it currently excludes landline users and people using feature phones on 2G networks.An industry executive was quoted by ET as saying that “landline numbers will be included after the data is integrated.”The DoT has urged telecom firms to implement CNAP quickly, with a nationwide rollout expected by March–April next year, depending on the trial results.However, operators have cited technological limitations on 2G networks as a key challenge for wider implementation.Telecom companies have not yet issued official comments on the ongoing trials.",The Calling Name Presentation (CNAP) service is currently being tested in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.

NEW DELHI: Weight-loss therapy drug Eli Lilly's Mounjaro has become the top selling brand in the domestic pharma retail market with sales of nearly Rs 100 crore in Oct, indicating the huge popularity of such treatments across India.Mounjaro has overtaken GSK's widely prescribed antibiotic and long-established market leader, Augmentin, which totalled sales of Rs 80 crore during the month, the latest data from Pharmatrac said.The sales pattern follows Mumbai and Delhi pockets of affluence, where both high purchasing power and a proliferation of weight-loss clinics are fuelling the demand.

Mumbai: The board of Swiggy on Friday cleared the company's plan to raise up to Rs 10,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP), the firm said in an exchange filing.The move follows rival Zepto's $450 million (close to Rs 4,000 crore) funding which has stoked competition in the growing 10-minute delivery space as more consumers take to quick commerce platforms to shop for household supplies.An additional fundraise, Swiggy had said, will give it access to ""sufficient growth capital"" while enhancing its strategic flexibility. The quick commerce sector, although expanding rapidly, is still nascent with large part of the growth being driven by the top metros.As companies ramp up their network of dark stores to cater to new pockets of demand, expand beyond metros and add new categories, they will need to make heavy investments into their rapid delivery businesses.Besides, new entrants Flipkart and Amazon are also vying for a share of the market, nudging the bigger players to keep their guards on.

GST rate cut eases discount pressure for truck makers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-rate-cut-eases-discount-pressure-for-truck-makers/articleshow/125176323.cms,"New GST Rates Take Effect; Farmers, Shopkeepers, Consumers React to New Tax Structure





CHENNAI: The recent GST rate rationalisation has not only resulted in a drop in the prices of commercial vehicles but also eased the long-standing pressure on original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to offer steep discounts in India's highly price-sensitive and fiercely competitive truck market.Before the GST revision, medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs) priced around Rs 50 lakh typically came with discounts of up to Rs 5 lakh - roughly 10% of the sticker price - as OEMs sought to attract buyers through aggressive pricing. However, with the GST rate on vehicles dropping from 28% to 18%, OEMs found room to scale back discounts substantially, reducing them to just about 2%, according to Umesh G Revankar, executive vice chairman, Shriram Finance.This shift effectively absorbed the tax relief into the pricing structure. While the tax cut lowered the base price of trucks, the simultaneous reduction in discounts meant that the overall cost to customers changed only marginally. ""Since OEMs have significantly reduced the discounts, the net cost to customers has not really changed much - hardly a big change for customers, especially in the commercial vehicle segment,"" he added.A senior official of an NBFC engaged in commercial vehicle financing said that while M&HCV prices came down after OEMs passed on the GST rate cuts, the discount levels dropped by at least 5 to 6 percentage points compared with previous levels.A top official of a leading truck and bus maker said the company witnessed a 3% to 4% drop in discount levels, though he couldn't confirm if the same trend was observed in the M&HCV segment.However, a couple of CV dealers described this drop in discounts as a temporary trend. Though OEMs maintain that they don't resort to discounts, it continues to be a norm in the competitive truck segment.",The recent GST rate rationalisation has resulted in a drop in the prices of commercial vehicles.

Britannia pads up for surge in demand post GST reset,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/britannia-pads-up-for-surge-in-demand-post-gst-reset/articleshow/125176313.cms,"GST





BENGALURU: Britannia Industries is gearing up for a ""lull before the storm"", as described by executive vice chairman and MD Varun Berry, ahead of a renewed push for volume-led growth amid stabilising GST rates and improving demand.The company expects growth to accelerate from the Dec quarter, with Berry indicating that organised players like Britannia are poised to gain market share as smaller regional rivals lose pricing leverage under the new tax regime.Berry quantified that the GST transition in late Sept dented revenue by 2%-2.5% in the second quarter, with the impact concentrated in the final month, as 85% of Britannia's portfolio moved to lower GST slabs. ""By mid-Nov, the impact will fully normalise,"" he told analysts on Friday. The company is banking on grammage increases in Rs 5 and Rs 10 packs, rural-led consumption, and sharper regional pricing strategies to drive recovery. Berry said the shift in GST from 18% to 5% reduced the arbitrage that allowed smaller local players to evade compliance and compete on price.""Market share gains will move toward organised players,"" he said, calling GST 2.0 a ""structural change for the food industry.""Berry added that the company is prepared to trade some margin to drive consumption.""If we have to get aggressive top-line growth, then we might have to look at a slight haircut as far as margins are concerned,"" he said. Gross margins stabilised as input prices for wheat, sugar, and palm oil remained within manageable ranges.Berry also confirmed that newly-appointed CEO Rakshit Hargave, who joins in Dec, will take full operational charge. ""He will handle the entire business. My job will be to help him wherever he needs any help, to run him in and make sure he settles down well,"" Berry said, clarifying there will be no split portfolios between them during the transition.He added that demand is expected to improve and reach double-digit growth ""in due course,"" helped by the GST-led grammage increase and better consumer sentiment in foods.Pricing growth in Q2 stood at 7-8%, but pricing will moderate as the company shifts focus to driving volumes. Rural consumption continues to outpace urban demand, and Britannia plans to deepen its direct distribution in villages.The company is also rolling out region-specific products and recipes."," Britannia Industries is gearing up for a ""lull before the storm"", as described by executive vice chairman and MD Varun Berry.

MUMBAI: RBI deputy governor T Rabi Sankar said the fight against digital fraud is far from over, noting that the decline seen earlier this year reversed in July, with cases rising again.He said fraud levels had been falling since the start of the year before showing an uptick mid-year, suggesting that such trends may be cyclical. ""This is not a fight that is won at a point in time. It's a continuous battle against bad actors who misuse any system,"" he said at the SBI Banking and Economic Conclave on Friday.Sankar said RBI's strategy is to leverage digital public infrastructure to strengthen security in payments. He cited initiatives such as the Mule Hunter AI and the Digital Payment Intelligence platform, which are designed to detect fraudulent accounts and prevent misuse. ""We are hoping that with the digital infrastructure we are creating, and with success rates of over 90% being reported, we will be able to contain frauds,"" he added.Sankar said that RBI has been working with a few banks, including State Bank of India, to test the use of censtral bank digital currency (CBDC) in cross-border transfers, in a move aimed at cutting settlement layers and related costs.He said the main expense in overseas remittances remains the currency exchange spread, which CBDC does not directly address. There are ongoing trials that may show whether exchange costs can be improved later, but Sankar described that as a separate challenge.Sankar said RBI is focusing on identifying domestic CBDC applications built on programmability, progressing cross-border pilots when suitable conditions exist, expanding tokenisation of money and assets, limiting risks from stablecoins, and strengthening fraud intelligence. He said RBI is not in a hurry and intends to calibrate timing with system conditions.

(ANI)





MUMBAI: Indian banks are now much bigger and stronger than they were a decade ago and the economy more resilient, which has emboldened the RBI to remove various restrictions, allowing banks greater exposure to capital market risks and to fund new activities such as acquisitions, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said. The governor also said that foreign capital flows through ECB and deposits would continue to remain strong for the rest of the year.The RBI has proposed a set of calibrated reforms to strengthen financial stability while supporting innovation. Draft rules on capital market exposure update 1999 lending norms, raising limits on loans against securities and rationalising lending to intermediaries. A new loan-to-value framework ties exposure to asset risk, while listed, investment-grade debt will now qualify as collateral, deepening the bond market. Banks may fund acquisitions under strict limits, aligning with NBFCs and bond markets.Speaking at the SBI Banking and Economic Conclave, Malhotra said acquisition finance was an integral element of an evolved financial system, that helps in better allocation of financial resources and removal of the restriction on banks will benefit the real economy.These banking reforms were announced by the RBI in its Oct 2025 monetary policy.The bold reforms were seen as measures to counter the impact of global uncertainty arising from US tariffs and sanctions. Malhotra explained the rationale behind the RBI's measures of safety lying in taking calculated risks, quoting Shakespeare: ""Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink; but out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety!""-to emphasise that while risk is inherent, safety comes from taking calculated risks. He said there were enough guardrails in place.For instance, ECBs in real estate are proposed to be permitted only for FDI-compliant real estate projects and remain prohibited for speculative real estate activity such as land or property trading.Malhotra said that with bank balance sheets stronger, the 2016 specific borrower framework has been scrapped and replaced by risk-based monitoring. He added that the economy was providing a supportive environment. ""The Indian economy has shown remarkable resilience in the face of global headwinds-growing steadily, maintaining financial stability, and continuing to attract investment when many others are slowing,"" he said.""Indian banks today are far more mature than they were. Credit and deposits have expanded almost three times. Capital buffers have strengthened-the CRAR has improved by about 4% from 2015 to 2025. Similarly, the CET1 has increased from 10.43% to 14.73%, an increase of 3.4%,"" said Malhotra.","Indian banks are now much bigger and stronger than they were a decade ago.

FULL: Trump, Orban Burst Into Laughter At Zelensky’s Chances Of Winning War, 'Crack Jokes' On EU

Why Trump exempted Hungary

What it means for Hungary

Russia-Ukraine war





The United States has granted Hungary a one-year exemption from its sanctions on the use of Russian oil and gas, a White House official said on Friday.The decision came after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán personally appealed for the reprieve during a meeting with US President Donald Trump in Washington.Orbán, a favorite of the MAGA movement and global conservatives, met the US president at the White House on Friday for their first bilateral meeting since the Republican returned to power, explaining why Hungary still needed Russian oil despite Trump urging Europe to stop importing it.Trump noted that Hungary faces challenges sourcing oil and gas elsewhere because it is landlocked and lacks ports, making alternatives difficult.“We’re looking at it, because it’s very different for him to get the oil and gas from other areas,” Trump said, as cited by the Guardian. “As you know, they don’t have ... the advantage of having sea. It’s a great country, it’s a big country, but they don’t have sea. They don’t have the ports.”Orbán said the issue was vital for Hungary, a European country, and pledged to lay out “the consequences for the Hungarian people, and for the Hungarian economy, not to get oil and gas from Russia.”Trump, aiming to put pressure on Moscow to end its war with Ukraine, appeared sympathetic to Orbán’s position.For Orbán, the exemption has shielded Hungary from the severe economic impact of last month’s US sanctions on two Russian oil giants. He had warned Trump that cutting Russian energy would bring Hungary’s economy “to its knees.”Trump also questioned why many European countries continued buying Russian oil and gas despite longstanding sanctions. He noted that, as part of the deal, Hungary also committed to purchasing around $600 million worth of US liquefied natural gas.The meeting was seen as a friendly summit, with Trump calling Orbán a great friend “beloved” in Hungary, and Orbán hoping for a “golden age” in US-Hungary relations.But US sanctions on Russia’s top energy companies are causing tension. Hungary depends heavily on Russian energy, and Orbán said the penalties are hurting the country’s struggling economy ahead of a tough reelection.On Friday, Orbán said his meeting with Trump would cover economic and military matters, along with political cooperation, but he emphasized that the primary focus was on the war in neighboring Ukraine.""It's a most important issue for us, and we would like to discuss with you how we can contribute to help you in your peace efforts,"" Orban told Trump, as reported by the NYT.Last month, Trump announced plans to meet his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Budapest, but the meeting was postponed after Russia rejected a ceasefire.","Hungary has been granted a one-year exemption from US sanctions on the use of Russian oil and gas.

Investor division over xAI investment



A roller coaster ride







Tesla CEO Elon Musk celebrated shareholder approval of his record-breaking $1 trillion compensation package with a flurry of ambitious promises, from humanoid robots performing surgery to building vehicles for missions to the Moon and Mars.The vote, which saw over 75% of investors back the deal, clears the path for Musk to expand his stake in Tesla to around 25% over the next decade and potentially become the world’s first trillionaire.Musk used the meeting to outline Tesla’s futuristic roadmap. He claimed the company’s humanoid robot, Optimus, would soon evolve from handing out candy to performing surgery “with beyond-human precision.”He also teased that both Optimus and Tesla’s vehicles could one day play a key role in establishing bases on the Moon and Mars. “It’ll be something cool — a next-level moon buggy or Mars buggy,” Musk told shareholders, Bloomberg reported.The billionaire added that Tesla aims to boost its car production by roughly 50% by the end of 2026, despite ongoing challenges in its automotive division, which is facing its second consecutive year of declining sales.“It’s not just a new chapter for Tesla, it’s a new book,” Musk declared during the company’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas.“That new book is about massively increasing vehicle production and ramping up Optimus production faster than anything in human history,” he added.The approval of Musk’s massive stock award cements his control over Tesla at a time when he had hinted he might divert more attention to other ventures if the deal failed.General Counsel Brandon Ehrhart announced that more than three-quarters of votes supported the package, prompting a standing ovation.The plan sets performance targets that could raise Tesla’s market value to $8.5 trillion, enough to make Musk’s total stake worth roughly $2.4 trillion, according to Bloomberg estimates. That figure would surpass the GDP of nearly every country except a handful of the largest economies.“There are significant hurdles,” noted Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “Musk now has to execute on the most important chapter in Tesla’s history, an autonomous and robotic future.”The compensation plan faced resistance from several institutional investors and proxy advisory firms, including Norway’s Norges Bank Investment Management and Glass Lewis, who cited its “unprecedented scale” and potential dilution of other shareholders.According to Bloomberg, critics also accused Tesla’s board of being overly deferential to Musk. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli called the deal “pay for unchecked power, not pay for performance,” while Senator Bernie Sanders described it as “totally absurd.”Musk acknowledged that Tesla’s growth will depend heavily on securing enough chips for its advanced technologies. He suggested that Tesla may build its own semiconductor facility to supplement existing supply from companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.“Even in the best-case scenario, the chip supply from our partners won’t meet our needs,” Musk said. “So we may have to build a Tesla terafab — like giga, but way bigger” he added.He revealed that three new products are expected to enter production next year — the humanoid Optimus, the long-delayed Semi truck, and the steering-wheel-less Cybercab, Tesla’s autonomous ride-hailing vehicle.While shareholders largely supported Musk’s pay deal, they were split over another proposal — a potential investment in Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI. Ehrhart said that although more votes were cast in favor than against, there was “a significant number” of abstentions.The measure was advisory and non-binding, meaning Tesla is not required to follow through. Musk has previously suggested Tesla could inject up to $5 billion into xAI to accelerate development in AI and robotics integration.Musk’s wealth has seen major swings this year. It peaked around $450 billion in January when he appeared alongside President Donald Trump at his inauguration but fell sharply amid political controversies and consumer backlash. A feud with Trump over policy disagreements later sent Tesla shares tumbling.His fortune has since rebounded, buoyed by a recovery in Tesla stock and rising valuations for SpaceX and his AI venture xAI. As of this week, Musk’s net worth stood at around $460 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Tesla’s shares slipped as much as 4.8% on Friday morning amid a broader market downturn, even as Musk vowed to “massively scale production and push the limits of human innovation.”","Elon Musk celebrated shareholder approval of his record-breaking $1 trillion compensation package with a flurry of ambitious promises.

Crypto market wipeout: Digital assets erase nearly all 2025 gains after early-October record high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/crypto-market-wipeout-digital-assets-erase-nearly-all-2025-gains-after-early-october-record-high/articleshow/125166933.cms,"Bitcoin slides below key support







The global cryptocurrency market has lost significant ground after reaching a record high earlier this month, with traders pulling back amid fears of deeper losses.At its October 6 peak, the total market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies hit nearly $4.4 trillion. However, a 20% slump since then has erased most of this year’s gains, leaving the asset class up just 2.5% in 2025, according to CoinGecko data.The downturn began shortly after the all-time high, when roughly $19 billion in leveraged positions were suddenly liquidated, a move that shattered investor confidence. Since then, traders have shown little appetite to bet on a quick rebound.The selloff comes despite what had been a bullish year for the sector, marked by increased regulatory clarity and growing institutional interest.President Donald Trump’s push to make the US a global crypto hub had earlier triggered a 35% rally in Bitcoin. But sentiment has since reversed sharply, with the total crypto market value now lower than when Trump took office.Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has fallen 9% this week, putting it on track for its worst weekly performance since March.It has also slipped below its 200-day moving average, a crucial technical level that had held since the 2022 bear market.As of Friday afternoon in London, Bitcoin was trading just below $100,000.While the recent downturn has hit the entire crypto market, altcoins, smaller and more volatile tokens, have suffered the steepest losses, lagging far behind Bitcoin and Ether this year.According to Bloomberg, Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at crypto exchange BTSE, attributed the latest slide in digital assets partly to growing worries that AI stocks are excessively overvalued.He cautioned that a broader correction in tech could deepen the crypto slump, saying, “If AI and tech stocks see a major selloff, Bitcoin could easily slip below the $100,000 mark — and altcoins may tumble even further.”Still, there are tentative signs of stabilisation. After six straight days of withdrawals, US spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs recorded $253 million in inflows on Thursday, offering a brief respite to the battered market.","At its October 6 peak, the total market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies hit nearly $4.4 trillion.

Trump tariffs also hitting US consumers? US President admits Americans ‘might be paying something’ due to tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-tariffs-also-hitting-us-consumers-us-president-admits-americans-might-be-paying-something-due-to-tariffs/articleshow/125155643.cms,"Dems In 'SHOCK' As Trump Refuses To Lift US Shutdown, Mulls ‘Game 2 Plan’ If SC Blocks Tariffs





In a shift from his long maintained approach over US tariffs, US President Donald Trump on Thursday acknowledged that consumers are actually paying higher prices for goods. This marks a switch in his stance, as he has long maintained that US citizens have benefited from the tariffs overall.During a discussion with journalists in the Oval Office, a reporter quoted Chief Justice John Roberts’ comment that tariffs are effectively taxes paid by Americans.When asked if he agreed, Trump said, ""No, I don't agree. I think that they might be paying something. But when you take the overall impact, the Americans are gaining tremendously.""Since taking office, the US President has used tariffs as a central tool of both diplomacy and economic strategy, repeatedly claiming that foreign nations, not Americans, were contributing to US coffers through the levies.Economists, however, pointed out that it is ultimately the consumers of imported goods who bear the cost.The issue has gained new attention after US Supreme Court justices raised doubts on Wednesday about the legality of Trump’s tariffs, in a case with far-reaching implications for presidential authority over trade policy, Reuters reported.Trump has warned that a ruling stripping him of the ability to set tariffs would be disastrous, saying his administration would need a contingency or “Plan B” if the court rules against him.For months, Trump has maintained that other countries are the ones paying the tariffs, levying duties on imports from China, Canada, the European Union and elsewhere. Removing tariffs, he argues, would eliminate a tool he has used to resolve trade conflicts and promote what he considers economic fairness for the United States, which itself faces tariffs from other nations.Reflecting on a potential Supreme Court ruling against him, Trump added, ""I think it'd be devastating for our country, but I also think that we'll have to develop a 'game two' plan. We'll see what happens.”“I hope that we win. I can't imagine that anybody would do that kind of devastation to our country,"" he further added.","US President Donald Trump on Thursday acknowledged that consumers are actually paying higher prices for goods.

What’s next





John Denver once sang, “I’m leaving on a jet plane.” In 2025, it’s more like, “I’m staying home because the FAA said no planes.” As the longest government shutdown in US history stretches into its second month, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has ordered airlines to cut 10% of flights across 40 major airports, creating the worst pre-holiday travel disruption in a generation.For millions of Americans, this isn’t just an inconvenience. It’s the collision of political dysfunction, economic anxiety, and logistical chaos. Thanksgiving travel - the country’s most sacred migration is now hostage to a shutdown that has frozen everything from air traffic salaries to safety oversight.At the heart of the crisis is money or rather, the absence of it. The government shutdown began on October 1 after budget negotiations between President Donald Trump and Congress collapsed. The sticking point: a standoff over immigration funding, federal spending limits, and a proposed rollback of green energy subsidies that Democrats refused to pass.As the impasse dragged on, the effects rippled across the public sector. More than 800,000 federal employees were either furloughed or forced to work without pay. Among them: the nation’s air traffic controllers and TSA officers - the people who keep planes in the sky and passengers moving safely through airports.By early November, the FAA’s own safety data began flashing red. Internal reports warned that fatigue among controllers was increasing, and voluntary safety submissions from pilots raised concerns about slower responses and communication errors.That’s when Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and FAA chief Bryan Bedford made a dramatic call: trim flights before something worse happens.The FAA’s emergency directive ordered all major carriers - including United, Delta, American, and Southwest to reduce their domestic flight schedules by 10%. The cuts were phased in over several days, starting at 4% and climbing to 10% by mid-November.The reductions target 40 of the nation’s busiest airports, from Atlanta to Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Dallas, and Miami. While long-haul international routes remain mostly intact, smaller and regional flights have been gutted. The logic is simple: fewer takeoffs mean less workload for controllers and lower risk of fatigue-related errors.But it’s a blunt instrument. Airlines were given just 48 hours to revise schedules, reassign crews, and refund passengers. Many had to scrap entire routes and rebook thousands of travellers. As of this week, flight-tracking sites recorded more than 3,000 cancellations nationwide since the order took effect.Air safety isn’t something anyone wants to gamble with, and the FAA’s logic is hard to dispute. But this is a crisis born of political dysfunction, not bad weather or technical failure. The shutdown has left the aviation system operating on fumes - and goodwill.Controllers, who are legally barred from striking, are showing up unpaid. TSA staff, also deemed “essential,” are working extra shifts to keep airports open. Many have taken second jobs to pay rent. The FAA’s training academy in Oklahoma City has suspended new recruit intakes, worsening an already critical staffing shortfall of about 3,000 controllers nationwide.In normal times, these shortages would already be a headache. Add a government shutdown, and it becomes a full-blown safety risk. As one aviation analyst put it, “You can’t run a 24/7 airspace system with exhausted people and no paychecks.”Politically, the shutdown has become a symbol of Washington’s paralysis. Republicans blame Democrats for refusing to compromise on spending cuts; Democrats accuse Trump of manufacturing chaos to force political concessions. Meanwhile, the travelling public pays the price - in cancelled flights, lost holidays, and shattered plans.Forty major airports are affected, including Atlanta, Chicago O’Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York’s three main hubs.The reductions are being rolled out through mid-November, just as Thanksgiving travel begins to surge.Airlines must provide full cash refunds for cancelled flights but are not obliged to cover accommodation or meals.Expect longer TSA lines as unpaid officers continue to report for duty, often understaffed.Early-morning or nonstop flights are less likely to be affected. Travellers are being urged to monitor airline apps closely and prepare backup plans, including alternative transport.The irony is painful: America’s air system, often celebrated as a marvel of modern efficiency, now mirrors the dysfunction of its politics. A nation that once built the world’s safest skies is struggling to keep its control towers staffed.The FAA’s flight cuts are both a safety measure and a cry for help - a way of forcing political leaders to confront the human cost of gridlock. Officials insist that it’s still safe to fly, but that reassurance is wearing thin. As fatigue builds and morale drops, the risk of systemic failure increases.Economically, the timing couldn’t be worse. Thanksgiving week is the single largest travel period in the United States, with more than 55 million people typically flying or driving. Airlines estimate that even a 10% cut in capacity could cost them over $400 million in lost revenue. Hotels, car rental companies, and restaurants around airports are bracing for similar losses.In short: this isn’t just a political dispute. It’s an economic chokehold on one of the most logistically complex networks in the world.Beyond the statistics, there’s fatigue, frustration, and a sense of futility. Controllers are working ten-hour shifts without pay. Pilots are flying fewer hours but facing angrier passengers. Families are stranded in terminals that feel like symbols of a larger national standstill.Thanksgiving is meant to be about homecoming. This year, it feels more like house arrest. Travellers stare at departure boards flashing Cancelled while politicians in Washington trade barbs on cable news. It’s a tableau of modern America: everyone waiting, no one moving, everyone blaming someone else.The FAA says the cuts are temporary and will be lifted once the shutdown ends. But aviation experts warn that the damage is already done. Even if funding resumes tomorrow, it will take weeks to restore full schedules and months to rebuild morale.For now, the skies above America remain half-empty, not because of storms or war, but because a divided government couldn’t pass a budget.John Denver’s lyric still rings out softly on airport speakers - “I’m leaving on a jet plane.” But in 2025, it sounds less like a promise and more like a question.","FAA has ordered airlines to cut 10% of flights across 40 major airports.

Which routes are hit the hardest

Airlines’ response

Why it matters

Bottom line





The Trump administration’s decision to reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 major US airports has caused the most widespread flight disruptions since the government shutdown began in October. The move, described by aviation analysts as “unprecedented,” is part of an emergency FAA directive to ease pressure on the national airspace system as thousands of air traffic controllers continue to work without pay.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered airlines to trim flight schedules by 10% at the country’s busiest hubs, including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. The cuts, phased in over several days, will reach their peak by November 14, 2025.According to FlightAware, nearly 800 flights were cancelled within, into, and out of the United States on Friday — the highest single-day total since the shutdown began. The reduction affects not just large airports but also regional routes feeding into them.Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said the move was about “assessing the data and alleviating building risk” amid staffing shortages.However, aviation experts argue the cuts amount to a major reduction in capacity ahead of the Thanksgiving rush.(Source: FAA, Washington Post reporting)Regional and short-haul flights have been the first casualties, especially those connecting smaller cities to major hubs such as Atlanta, Dallas, and Chicago.Remote communities in Alaska are being prioritised for service continuity, while Alaska Airlines trims routes on busier corridors.International and long-haul flights remain unaffected, with United, Delta, and American Airlines confirming that transatlantic and transpacific routes will continue as planned.Hub-to-hub routes, such as LAX–JFK and ORD–ATL, have been protected to maintain network efficiency.American Airlines has cut about 4% of its schedule (roughly 220 flights daily) but continues to operate 6,000 flights each day.United Airlines will maintain around 4,000 daily flights, offering refunds to any passenger who cancels travel during this period.Delta and Southwest have offered flexible booking policies and waived penalties for cancellations.Under the FAA order, airlines must issue full refunds for cancellations but are not required to cover hotel or incidental costs.The reduction comes just weeks before the busy Thanksgiving season and could ripple across the national aviation system for weeks even after the order is lifted. The FAA cited “fatigue building in the system” among air traffic controllers and said the cuts were designed to protect safety standards.However, critics have called it “safety-washing” — a political move to pressure Congress to end the shutdown. Airlines are warning that even if operations resume, it may take time for flight schedules to stabilise.The FAA’s 10% flight cut has hit 40 of America’s busiest airports, grounding around 800 flights a day and causing ripple effects through the entire aviation network. While safety remains the stated goal, passengers can expect longer waits, regional disruptions, and continued uncertainty through mid-November.","FAA orders 10% flight cuts at 40 U.S. airports.

China's rare earths move: Trump’s hopes of full restrictions rollback might be shattered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-rare-earths-move-trumps-hopes-of-full-restrictions-rollback-might-be-shattered-heres-why/articleshow/125154917.cms,"'Highly Respected Xi...': Trump Changes Tune After China's Warning | Rare Earths Row | Tariff War

Long validity, bigger volumes — but not for everyone





China is creating a new licensing system to make rare earth exports faster and easier. However, the country has given no sign that it will remove the restrictions put in place in April, falling short of meeting US President Donald Trump’s hopes of a full rollback.The ministry of commerce told some exporters that they will be able to apply for new permits under a streamlined process, two sources who attended recent closed-door briefings told Reuters. During those meetings, officials outlined the paperwork exporters will be required to submit once the system comes into effect.Rare earths and rare earth magnets, which are critical for products ranging from electric vehicles to missile guidance systems, are dominated by China, the country accounts for more than 90% of the world’s processed supply. The export controls have become one of Beijing’s most powerful levers in its trade tensions with the United States.The shift comes shortly after US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached an agreement, following which China announced it would pause for one year the export restrictions that were imposed in October.Despite that, Beijing has not publicly addressed the broader set of controls introduced in April, which disrupted supply chains and alarmed manufacturers reliant on the minerals.Washington has presented the impending permits as a decisive breakthrough. The White House said on Saturday that China had agreed to introduce general licences and described them as the “de facto end” of rare earth export controls.However, people involved in discussions paint a different picture.Three separate sources told Reuters that while officials have acknowledged work on the new licensing structure, one warned that the process of finalising it could take months.Other industry insiders noted that the creation of these licences does not remove the wide-ranging restrictions imposed earlier in the year.The new permits are expected to last for an entire year and could allow exporters to ship larger quantities of material, Reuters reported citing sources. Companies have begun collecting documents in anticipation of the change, and customers will now be required to furnish more detailed information.Further clarification on how the new process will operate is expected before the end of the year, although some Chinese rare earth producers said they have not been informed of any changes so far. Several industry figures noted that obtaining licences could still be difficult for customers linked to defence contractors or other sensitive sectors.The export regime that China introduced in April and tightened in October, currently requires companies to secure approval for every shipment.The system has been widely criticised by international buyers, who say it has slowed deliveries to a crawl. The rules triggered supply shortages in May and forced temporary shutdowns at certain automotive manufacturing facilities.European Union companies have submitted roughly 2,000 applications since April, but just over half have been granted.","China is creating a new licensing system to make rare earth exports faster and easier.

US job market: Layoffs spiked in October; report says highest for the month in 22 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-job-market-layoffs-spiked-in-october-report-says-highest-for-the-month-in-22-years/articleshow/125148736.cms,"



rThe wave of layoffs sweeping across the United States intensified in October, with more than 153,000 positions eliminated, the highest total for the month in 22 years, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.The consultancy, cited by CBS News, reported that employers have now disclosed almost 1.1 million job cuts since January.No year has seen a higher tally through October since 2020, when the pandemic forced shutdowns and sent unemployment soaring.Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at the firm, said the surge reflects a turning point in how employers are approaching staffing.""October's pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,"" he said, noting that businesses that previously held off on reductions now lean on AI to replace human workers.Challenger added, ""Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes.Evidence of a cooling labour market has been visible across several indicators. The payroll processor ADP reported weaker hiring among private employers this week, suggesting companies are slowing recruitment significantly compared to earlier in the year.The shift in hiring conditions was also acknowledged by policymakers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cited concerns around reduced hiring when announcing interest rate cuts in both September and October.The usual government data that tracks the state of the labour market remains delayed. The Department of Labor has been unable to issue its monthly employment report since October 1, after the government shutdown halted the release of September’s figures and is now expected to push back the October update as well.For employees looking for new roles, the environment is becoming tougher. ""Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market,"" Challenger said, as cited by CBS News.Forecasts suggest the slowdown may last. The National Association for Business Economics predicted last month that the unemployment rate, 4.3% in August, could rise to 4.5% in 2026.","153,000 positions eliminated in October, the highest total for the month in 22 years.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Income Tax Department Crackdown

Income Tax Department’s extensive crackdown! Over the past 20 months, the Income Tax Department has collected Rs 37,000 crore from individuals who had taxable income but failed to file returns, according to officials.Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash. ""These are the cases where people were not filing tax returns despite making large purchases. The department had reached out to them over the past 20 months,"" a senior official informed ET.The official noted that an expanded and stricter tax collection and TDS system has helped identify significant transactions that previously went unnoticed.The official indicated that some individuals submitted returns claiming zero income despite substantial expenditure and tax obligations. From the total Rs 37,000 crore recovered, Rs 1,320 crore came from individuals involved in high-value transactions.The department is conducting an extensive initiative to contact taxpayers whose spending patterns do not align with their declared income.Since FY21, it has actively used data analytics and the Non-Filer Monitoring System to identify non-compliant individuals.""Data from multiple sources is being tapped and synchronised... This makes it easy for the department to identify such evasion and nab evaders,"" the official stated.Official data revealed that direct tax collections for April-November increased by 15.4% to Rs 12.10 lakh crore, comprising Rs 5.10 lakh crore in corporate tax and Rs 6.61 lakh crore in non-corporate tax.","Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash.

Elon Musk-led Tesla has recommenced its search for showroom locations in New Delhi, according to two sources who spoke to Reuters, indicating a potential reconsideration of its Indian market entry after previously suspending investment plans this year.Following a temporary pause in its Indian showroom search, Tesla has now initiated preliminary discussions with DLF regarding space in the capital region, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the developments.According to one source, Tesla seeks 3,000 to 5,000 square feet for a customer experience centre, plus additional space triple that size for service and delivery operations.The company is considering various locations, including DLF's Avenue Mall in southern Delhi and the Cyber Hub complex in Gurugram.Earlier this year, Elon Musk indicated plans to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and potentially announce a $2-3 billion investment in India.

Flyers' wait to let laptops remain in cabin bags for security checks gets longer; Govt panel examining 3D X-ray scanner tech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/flyers-wait-to-let-laptops-remain-in-cabin-bags-for-security-checks-gets-longer-govt-panel-examining-3d-x-ray-scanner-tech/articleshow/116353860.cms,"NEW DELHI: The mad scramble for plastic trays at airports' pre-embarkation security check points for keeping personal electronic devices (PEDs), chargers and liquids separately from cabin bags has just got a little longer. The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has asked airport operators not to install 3D computed tomography X-ray (CTX) machines for scanning cabin bag that would have allowed these things to remain inside bags.For now, airports need to instead stick to the currently used 2D tech scanners that require electronics and liquids to be taken out. The reason: a high-powered multi-agency is examining the “suitability” of 3D CTX technology and whether it meets all threats that aviation in our country faces, said multiple people in the know.This high-powered committee is also examining technology of body scanners — that do away with pat down checks of passengers — from an Indian perspective. “This committee is expected to shortly take a call on both CT X-ray and body scanners. Once the norms are finalised, airport operators will then be asked to change the security furniture in one go,” said sources.“The question we asked ourselves is whether we should blindly go for the 3D X-ray scanners being used in the US and Europe since we have our own unique threat perception. Then it was decided to come out with India-specific norms or requirements for this technology factoring in our concerns. That will require original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to tweak their scanners for use at Indian airports,” they said.The same panel is looking at full body scanners (FBS) from a “cultural aspect” of India. “People here use certain things for religious reasons. There are other things like, say gold bangles, which may sometimes be difficult to remove. The chunnat (layers) of saris/lungis are another aspect. The norms for body scanners from Indian perspective are also being looked at and will be issued shortly. OEMs of these products are on board and these items will be made from an Indian perspective,” they added.While 3D CT X-ray machines are awaited to make pre-embarkation security check more seamless and end the mad scramble for plastic trays — that worsens in winters as at least one more tray is needed per passenger for jackets, — FBS promise to make checks more thorough, quicker and less intrusive with no pat down needed.The rethink comes after BCAS had last year given Dec 31, 2023, deadline for airports handling 50 lakh and more passengers annually were to install CTX machines for cabin bag checks. And all hyper sensitive airports seeing a crore and more passengers annually were to introduce FBS by the same date. And all big new airports like greater Noida and Navi Mumbai were to open with these systems in place. However, now first the norms are awaited and then OEMs have to make machines meeting the same available before they can be ordered amid global supply chain issues and then installed at Indian airports.“We expect the high powered committee to give its decision on norms from an Indian perspective soon. Then OEMs will have to make equipment that meets these requirements. Hopefully next year we should see rollout of these much-awaited systems,” said people in the know.",The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has asked airport operators not to install 3D computed tomography X-ray (CTX) machines.

NEW DELHI: India's trade deficit widened to a record $37.9 billion in Nov as imports hit an all-time high of almost $70 billion on soaring gold imports, while exports fell as a decline in petroleum shipments wiped out the gains from non-oil exports.In Nov, gold shipments into the country soared over four times to $14.9 billion, compared to $3.5 billion a year ago, making it the second largest item in India's import basket after petroleum with a 21% share of all imports. What added to the pressure was an 87% jump in vegetable oil imports, which were estimated at $1.9 billion.While oil imports were up 8%, the export of petrol and diesel crashed by half to $3.7 billion. Similarly, gems & jewellery exports were down 25% to $2.1 billion. Overall exports fell almost 5% to $32 billion.Govt is, however, drawing comfort from an 8% increase in non-oil exports to $28.5 billion. ""Non-oil exports are growing in a comfortable manner. Huge fluctuation in petroleum prices is affecting exports,"" said commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal.Despite the fall in merchandise exports, the outlook for non-petroleum exports and services remains positive for the next four months, with overall exports seen at over $800 billion during the current fiscal year, he said.Barthwal and his colleagues attributed the surge in gold imports to a steep rise in global prices and its safe haven status at a time when stocks remain volatile. L Satya Srinivas, additional secretary in commerce department, said that in the past too gold imports had seen a surge in a few particular months. Although the officers were silent on the issue, a part of the increase may also be attributed to lower customs duty, resulting in more yellow metal coming through legal channels instead of being smuggled.",India's trade deficit widened to a record $37.9 billion in Nov.

"In a first, Indian services exports to outstrip goods",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/in-a-first-indian-services-exports-to-outstrip-goods/articleshow/116382467.cms,"Identifies 6 services for special thrust, targets $1tn exports.

Marking a major shift in India's trade, services exports are projected to overtake goods shipments in Nov, latest figures shared by the commerce department on Monday showed.After months of sustained increase, last month's services exports have been provisionally estimated at $35.7 billion, compared with $32.1 billion of merchandise or goods exports .""Services are doing well, and we expect exports to reach $1 trillion in the coming years,"" said commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal. Typically, the commerce department puts out an estimate or a projection for services the previous month while releasing the goods trade numbers. Then, RBI releases its estimates. For instance, RBI has estimated Oct services exports at $34.3 billion, compared with the commerce department's projection of $34 billion when the goods trade data was released last month.Services have held steady as Global Capability Centres (GCCs) have more than made up for the muted rise in IT and IT-enabled exports, with management, legal and accounting services also seeing healthy growth. In contrast, goods trade has been hit by the slowdown in Europe and other parts of the world due to high inflation as well as conflict in west Asia and Ukraine.Currently, software is the big daddy of services, accounting for 47% of exports last year, with nearly 70% heading to the US.Going forward, govt is seeking to make it more balanced. The commerce department has identified six services - IT and IT-enabled services, business services, maritime services, tourism, audio visual, gaming and related services and digitally delivered health and education - for special focus. ""We are preparing a strategy to push growth in these sectors, factoring in the demand as well as the skill and scale that we have in the country,"" an official told TOI.For instance, govt is looking at how GCCs can be given further impetus, or how maritime can help Indian companies not just service global clients but also help in delivering Indian goods across the seas, especially when it has been identified as a strategic sector. Tourism is seen as a big opportunity, given that there are a plethora of destinations to showcase and can create a large number of jobs.""This number (Nov) should not surprise anyone. Higher services growth has been a consistent trend and is now resulting into higher export values,"" said Ajay Srivastava, who leads research body GTRI, while identifying other business services as the rising star.While goods exports can once again overtake services in the coming months, GTRI has projected that going by the current growth trends from 2018-19 to 2023-24, by 2029-30 services exports will reach $618.2 billion, edging past merchandise exports, which are projected at $613 billion.Over the last 11 years, services trade has grown faster than goods, not just for India but globally. And, India has outpaced global growth on both fronts. In its latest update, UNCTAD said that global trade is projected to reach a record $33 trillion, rising 3.3% this year, with services notching up 7% growth.","Last month's services exports have been provisionally estimated at $35.7 billion, compared with $32.1 billion of merchandise or goods exports.

HYDERABAD: India's tech firms have stepped up their game to draw more millennial and Gen Z employees to their offices.

NEW DELHI: The Maharashtra cabinet was sworn in on Sunday in the presence of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar . Governor CP Radhakrishnan administered oath to the ministers at Raj Bhavan in Nagpur.The swearing-in of the state cabinet in Nagpur, which comes a day before the winter session of the legislature, marks a rare occasion as the last such ceremony in Nagpur happened in 1991, when the then governor C Subramaniam administered oath to Chhagan Bhujbal and other ministers.The portfolio allocation to the ministers is expected to wrap up soon as the parties have just one day to ascertain the roles of the MLAs before the session kicks off.The cabinet was sworn in ten days after Devendra Fadnavis took oath as chief minister at Mumbai's Azad Maidan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the ceremony, which also saw Ajit Pawar from the NCP and former CM Eknath Shinde from Shiv Sena taking oath as deputy chief ministers.The prolonged deliberations over portfolio allocations and last-minute Cabinet swearing-in could be attributed to Mahayuti's challenges in balancing power with Shiv Sena and NCP factions, both eager to secure influential roles in the government.In the state polls, the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance secured a decisive victory, winning 235 seats. The BJP emerged as the single-largest party with 132 seats, while Shiv Sena won 57 and NCP secured 41 seats. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance faced a major setback, with Congress winning just 16 seats, Shiv Sena (UBT) securing 20, and the NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) claiming only 10 seats.","Chandrashekhar Bawankule, BJP's state president, was the first to be sworn in as cabinet minister.

The allegations

Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal

Settlement and mediation

The Australian Information Commissioner announced on Tuesday that it has withdrawn its civil penalty proceedings against Meta Platforms , following a $31.85 million (A$50 million) settlement by the Facebook parent company. The lawsuit, originally filed in 2020, centered on allegations that Meta had shared personal user data with the "" This is Your Digital Life "" personality quiz app, a key element of the wider Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal.The lawsuit accused Meta of violating Australian privacy laws by disclosing the personal information of over 300,000 Australian users to the quiz app between 2014 and 2015. This disclosure was alleged to have occurred without the users' consent, as part of the broader controversy surrounding the misuse of data by the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica .According to the Australian Information Commissioner, Meta breached Australian Privacy Principle 6 by using the data for purposes other than what it was originally collected for, and failed to take reasonable steps to protect user data, violating Privacy Principle 11.1(b).The data misuse controversy first emerged in early 2018, with the Guardian reporting that Cambridge Analytica had harvested personal data from millions of Facebook users. Though 270,000 users consented to data collection via the ""This Is Your Digital Life"" app, the data of approximately 50 million users was ultimately exploited, allegedly to create voter profiles and target political ads.The scandal drew scrutiny globally, leading to fines for Facebook in the United States and the UK in 2019. Australia's privacy regulator launched its legal action against Meta in 2020, claiming that the data of 311,127 Australian Facebook users was exposed to the risk of unauthorized disclosure.Following the legal proceedings, Australia's federal court ordered Meta and the privacy commissioner to enter mediation in June 2023. The settlement reached in the mediation process marks the largest ever payment in Australia dedicated to addressing privacy concerns, according to Australian Information Commissioner Elizabeth Tydd.Meta spokespersons confirmed that the company settled the lawsuit ""on a no admission basis,"" signaling the closure of this chapter on past practices. Despite the settlement, the company’s involvement in the data scandal continues to affect its reputation worldwide.","Facebook settles with Meta Platforms for $31.85 million (A$50 million) The lawsuit centered on allegations that Meta shared personal user data with the ""This is Your Digital Life "" personality quiz app. The lawsuit accused Meta of violating Australian privacy laws by disclosing the personal information of over 300,000 Australian users to the quiz app between 2014 and 2015.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116383780,imgsize-468196,width-400,resizemode-4/116383780.jpg"
"Who is Daniel Kretinsky, the Czech dealmaker who’s buying Royal Mail?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/who-is-daniel-kretinsky-the-czech-dealmaker-whos-buying-royal-mail/articleshow/116376385.cms,"Here’s more on Kretinsky and how he made his fortune.

What are the origins of Kretinsky’s wealth?

How rich is Kretinsky now, and where are his assets?

What’s his investment strategy?

What’s Kretinsky’s interest in the Royal Mail?

Were there concerns over Kretinsky’s Royal Mail investment?

Daniel Kretinsky has spent more than a decade building a network of businesses across Europe, from power stations to retail chains and media outlets, with a recent focus on financially distressed assets.The 49-year-old Czech billionaire hasn’t shied away from investing in troubled businesses that are politically sensitive. In December, the UK government approved Kretinsky’s £3.6 billion ($4.6 billion) takeover of the Royal Mail ’s parent company after he made a series of investment commitments. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds called it “yet another example of this government’s commitment to working hand in hand with business.”A lawyer by training, Kretinsky got his start in business in 1999 at private investment firm J&T in Prague. A decade later, he formed the energy group EPH , taking a minority stake and securing the backing of partners from J&T and the late Czech billionaire Petr Kellner.Through acquisitions, he created a conglomerate of dozens of companies operating in nine countries and in industries ranging from electricity production and distribution to natural gas transmission and storage, trading and logistics. Kretinsky also owns stakes in French food retailer Casino Guichard Perrachon SA, German industrial group Thyssenkrupp AG’s ailing steel unit and soccer clubs West Ham United and AC Sparta Praha.His net worth was $7 billion as of mid-December, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That makes him the second-richest Czech after Renata Kellnerova — Kellner’s widow — and her family.Kretinsky’s business empire in the Czech Republic includes power generation, gas distribution and storage, heat production and media. He also controls companies in Slovakia, Germany, the UK, France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Italy.With his investments in energy-related business, Kretinsky has made a bet that it will take European countries longer than expected to wean their economies off fossil fuels. EPH, in which he now holds a controlling stake, scooped up assets that publicly traded utilities were forced to offload by banks under new environmental investing rules.By taking energy businesses private, Kretinsky has drawn criticism from climate campaign groups, which say those companies are now subject to weaker scrutiny of their environmental performance.Kretinsky has been diversifying his investments away from energy and said he aims to target industries that provide essential products and services — in areas such as infrastructure, retail and mail delivery.His business empire is spread across several companies, with the largest of these, EPH, holding assets valued at just under €29 billion ($30 billion). He usually works with a relatively small team of advisers on deals. His inner circle includes Chief Financial Officer Pavel Horsky, who’s been with EPH since its inception in 2009 and has been busy integrating Kretinsky’s assets under a new brand, EP Group.UK parcel delivery has boomed with the growth in online shopping, yet the former state-owned Royal Mail has been making losses due to tough competition. Previous management clashed with its large, unionized workforce, and its chief executive quit in May 2023 following a dispute over pay and conditions.Kretinsky agreed to buy International Distribution Services Plc , Royal Mail’s parent company, in May. At the time, he told Bloomberg News that the company needed investment to maintain its market share. Kretinsky’s company has promised to respect the Royal Mail’s obligation to deliver letters and parcels to every part of the UK, and not to change its ownership for at least three years.The sale to a foreign owner has been politically divisive as the delivery service was state-owned until 2013, when it was privatized.He has faced similar scrutiny of deals made in France. Last year, he led a group of investors who reached an agreement to re-capitalize and gain control over Casino, a major player in French food retail.","Daniel Kretinsky has spent more than a decade building a network of businesses across Europe.

Honeywell considers spinning off aerospace business amid Elliott's breakup push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/honeywell-considers-spinning-off-aerospace-business-amid-elliotts-breakup-push/articleshow/116373580.cms,"Honeywell said on Monday it was considering a plan to separate its high-margin aerospace business, a move backed by activist investor Elliott Investment Management , which has been pushing for the company's breakup.The company, one of the last surviving U.S. conglomerates, has been on a deal-making spree this year under CEO Vimal Kapur, as it focuses on automation, aviation and energy businesses, while shedding segments that do not align with its plans.Its shares have, however, underperformed this year, attracting the attention of Elliott, which has taken a more than $5 billion stake in the company and pushed for the separation of its aerospace and automation business.Honeywell said on Monday its board had made ""significant progress"" on its review of strategic alternatives to date and the company would provide an update with its fourth-quarter results, usually scheduled in the last week of January. Shares were up 2% in early trade.Elliott responded by welcoming the company's announcement.""We believe the portfolio transformation Vimal and his team are leading represents the right course for Honeywell, and we look forward to the upcoming completion of the review and to supporting Honeywell as it implements the necessary steps to realize its full value,"" the activist investor said.A standalone aerospace business, which is Honeywell's biggest unit by revenue and counts Boeing and Airbus as its customers, could be valued between $90 billion and $120 billion including debt, analysts said.The aerospace unit, which builds everything from engines to cockpit components, has benefited from rising jet production in the last few years, though supply chain disruptions have hurt the company's ability to meet some of that demand.For the first nine months of 2024, Honeywell's aerospace business reported revenue of $11.47 billion, accounting for about 40% of the firm's total sales for the period.The jetmaking boom is set to continue in the coming years amid record backlogs at planemakers, while a shortage of planes is set to boost demand for repairs.""The setting of an imminent date (Q4 EPS) for a strategic update suggests a larger break-up is likely, in our view,"" Barclays analysts wrote in a note.A potential spinoff will echo a similar announcement by General Electric in 2021. As of Friday, GE's aerospace business had a higher market value than Honeywell as a whole.Honeywell had disclosed in November that it would sell its personal protective equipment business to Protective Industrial Products for about $1.33 billion in cash.The conglomerate has also bought Carrier's security business for $4.95 billion and acquired aerospace and defense firm CAES Systems for $1.9 billion as part of its wider shift.",Honeywell is considering a plan to separate its high-margin aerospace business. The move is backed by activist investor Elliott Investment Management. Elliott has taken a more than $5 billion stake in the company and pushed for the separation.

However, neither Dixon nor Vivo India will have any stake in each other.“The facility will undertake part of Vivo’s OEM orders of smartphones in India, and can also engage in OEM business of various electronic products of other brands,” Dixon said, emphasising that the deal will not have any impact on its contract manufacturing business for other brands such as Motorola and Nokia.“The parties will agree on an optimum structure and the relevant terms and conditions to be set out in the definitive agreements. The transaction will be subject to execution of such definitive agreements, completion of customary conditions precedent and receipt of applicable regulatory approvals including as required under the foreign exchange control laws of India,” the company said.Tata group was also believed to be looking at a deal with Vivo India, but it could not materialise.Dixon Vice Chairman and MD Atul B Lall said the company sees Vivo India as an “ideal strategic partner” that shares its core values of quality, engineering prowess and customer satisfaction. “We believe that this association will bolster our manufacturing excellence and superior execution abilities and Vivo’s leadership in the Indian business ecosystem.

Why World Bank cancelled $500 million loan to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/why-world-bank-cancelled-500-million-loan-to-pakistan/articleshow/116317050.cms,"The PACE program

Attempts for lower electricity prices

World Bank goals

The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions within the time limit. The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , according to The Express Tribune.The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year which has sent a shock to the Pakistani economy as the country has almost exhausted its loan quota.""No budget support is planned for the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025,"" the World Bank spokesperson stated.For this fiscal year, the IMF has identified a $2.5 billion external financing gap that needs to be addressed through new loans.The World Bank has canceled a loan of $500 to $600 million meant for Pakistan under the Affordable and Clean Energy Program (PACE-II), government sources revealed. Initially set at $500 million, the loan amount was later raised to $600 million to help address Pakistan's external financing gap, quoted news agency ANI.The PACE program was approved by the World Bank in June 2021, with the first tranche of USD 400 million already released. The second installment depended on meeting several conditions, such as holding talks with all Independent Power Producers (IPPs), especially the Chinese power plants built under CPEC. It was discovered that no progress had been made in renegotiating agreements with CPEC-related power plants as China has consistently refused to revisit these deals or restructure the energy debt, which amounts to approximately $16 billion.To reduce electricity costs, the government is renegotiating energy agreements with power plants set up under the 1994 and 2002 policies. The Chinese-owned power plants, along with several government-run plants, including four LNG-based and two nuclear plants, fall under the 2015 energy policy. Though the government has tried negotiating over 22 energy contracts yet, no significant reductions have been made in electricity prices which linger from 65 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) to 70 PKR.A spokesperson for the World Bank confirmed that ""slower-than-expected progress led to a shift in strategy in our support for reform"" in Pakistan's energy sector. The spokesperson further elaborated that the lender has been supporting power sector reforms through the PACE initiative.Even though slower progress led the World Bank to revise its lending strategy, the World Bank has continued its support by directly financing low-cost hydropower projects, including an additional $1 billion for the Dasu Hydropower project.Furthermore, the Bank has also continued working with all stakeholders to expedite the implementation of the Electricity Distribution Efficiency Improvement Project, aimed at improving efficiency in the power distribution sector. It has also offered technical assistance to promote private sector involvement in power distribution companies (DISCOs).For the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan anticipated $2 billion in loans from the World Bank.However, by the end of the July-October period, only $349 million, 18 per cent of the planned amount, had been disbursed.Under the PACE-II program, Pakistan was expected to tackle inefficiencies in power distribution companies and reduce the growth of circular debt. However, the government has been unable to achieve either of these objectives. The government had approved a roadmap under PACE-I to encourage private sector involvement in the distribution sector, but it remained far from implementation.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) recently reported that inefficiencies in power distribution companies led to losses of PKR 660 billion in the last fiscal year. During the same period, circular debt surged to PKR 2.393 trillion, far exceeding the targets set in agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The successful implementation of this roadmap was essential for evaluating the progress of the power sector reform program, but it was not carried out.",The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions.

Gold rally may slow down in 2025: WGC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/gold-rally-may-slow-down-in-2025-wgc/articleshow/116303894.cms,"Representative image

Gold prices are set to rise more slowly in 2025 after a record-breaking run this year, according to the World Gold Council .Bullion is up more than 30% so far in 2024, but gains next year will likely be tempered by variables like growth and inflation, the WGC said. Possible trade wars in US President-elect Donald Trump's second term and complicated interest-rate outlooks may spill over into subpar economic growth, hurting demand from investors and consumers, the industry association said in its 2025 outlook report released on Thursday.""All eyes are on the US. Trump's second term may provide a boost to the local economy but could equally elicit a fair degree of nervousness for investors around the world, it said.Bullion's rally in the early part of 2024 was driven by large purchases by central banks, especially the People's Bank of China and others in emerging markets. It got a further boost from the Federal Reserve's recent monetary easing and haven demand during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions including wars in West Asia and Ukraine. However, gains have stalled due to a rally in the dollar following Trump's election win.Some banks are still bullish on the prospects of the precious metal, currently trading near $2,700 an ounce, next year. Goldman Sachs Group is forecasting it will get to $3,000 by the end of 2025, while UBS AG sees $2,900.China's actions in the gold market will be closely watched. So far, investors there have provided price support, while consumers have stayed on the sidelines, but ""these dynamics hang on the direct (and indirect) effects of trade, stimulus and perceptions of risk,"" the WGC said.The yellow metal will rise if the world sees ""significantly lower interest rates, or a deterioration in geopolitics or financial market conditions,"" the council said. Lower rates typically benefit gold as it pays no interest.","Bullion is up more than 30% so far in 2024, but gains next year will likely be tempered by variables like growth and inflation.

Both countries subsequently joined the OECD.In 2021, Switzerland interpreted that when Colombia and Lithuania joined the OECD, a 5 per cent dividend rate would apply to the India-Switzerland tax treaty under the MFN clause, instead of the agreement's stated 10 per cent.Following the MFN status suspension, from January 1, 2025, Switzerland will impose a 10 per cent tax on dividends for Indian tax residents seeking Swiss withholding tax refunds and Swiss tax residents claiming foreign tax credits.The Swiss finance department officially announced the suspension of the MFN clause protocol between Switzerland and India regarding double taxation avoidance on income taxes.The Swiss authorities cited a 2023 Indian Supreme Court ruling in a case involving Vevey-based Nestle as the basis for withdrawing the MFN status.This decision means Swiss authorities will levy a 10 per cent tax on dividends earned by Indian entities in Switzerland from January 1, 2025.The statement notes that whilst the Delhi High Court supported the applicability of residual tax rates considering the MFN clause in 2021, the Indian Supreme Court reversed this on October 19, 2023, concluding that the MFN clause was not directly applicable without proper notification under Section 90 of the Income Tax Act.Nangia Andersen M&A Tax Partner Sandeep Jhunjhunwala commented that this unilateral suspension represents a significant change in bilateral treaty dynamics.He added that Indian entities in Switzerland may face increased tax obligations, highlighting the challenges of managing international tax treaties in today's global context.Jhunjhunwala emphasised the importance of treaty partners agreeing on interpretation and application of tax treaty clauses for predictability and stability.AKM Global Tax Partner, Amit Maheshwari, explained that reciprocity drove the MFN withdrawal decision, aiming for equal treatment of taxpayers in both nations.Maheshwari noted that Swiss authorities had previously announced a reduction in dividend tax rates from 10 to 5 per cent, retroactive from July 5, 2018, but the 2023 Supreme Court ruling contradicted this position.He concluded that this could affect Swiss investments in India through higher dividend withholding, and from January 1, 2025, taxation may revert to original treaty rates, disregarding the MFN clause.JSA Advocates & Solicitors Partner Kumarmanglam Vijay indicated this would particularly affect Indian companies with ODI structures involving Swiss subsidiaries, increasing Swiss dividend withholding tax from 5 to 10 per cent from January 1, 2025.",The Swiss authorities have suspended the most favoured nation status (MFN) provision in the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with India.

Catch-up: Amazon goes all in on AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/catch-up-amazon-goes-all-in-on-ai/articleshow/116268969.cms,"Amazon

LAS VEGAS: Amazon's cloud unit AWS unveiled new AI models and chips to take on rivals like Microsoft, which has had an edge due to its ties with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.Exactly two years ago, the launch of ChatGPT thrust Silicon Valley into the AI age, forcing tech giants to redraw plans and wiping out billions from market caps of companies that were slow to adapt. AWS, which pioneered renting out data infrastructure, was seen to be losing grip on its cloud dominance over the past two years amid the AI boom.However, Andy Jassy, who built AWS before succeeding Jeff Bezos as Amazon CEO in 2021, sees it differently. ""When we talk about AI, it is typically less to announce that we have beat the best chess player in the world... We are not using AI because we think it is cool. We are using it because we are trying to solve customer problems,"" Jassy said at AWS's annual tech event re:Invent in Las Vegas last week. AWS has sought to embed AI into its services and push customers to bring more of their applications by offering them a wide choice of AI models and chips, including its in-house ones, through its Bedrock platform.""With the announcement of Nova, we have made it clear that we want to compete... Whether it's chips or models, we will be very competitive on costs,"" Sherry Marcus, director of applied science (GenAI) at AWS, told TOI. Nova, which launched last week, is AWS's answer to AI foundation models like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4o. Essentially, these are machine learning models trained on vast datasets and designed to produce a range of outputs, including chatbots.AI-related capabilities dominated AWS's announcements at the cloud conference.

The Nasdaq Composite Index achieved a historic milestone on Wednesday, reaching 20,000 for the first time, driven by enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence and anticipated interest rate reductions that propelled technology stocks to remarkable heights.The technology-focused index has risen over 33% this year, led by major tech firms including Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and recently Tesla. The gains on Wednesday followed a US inflation report that strengthened expectations for a Federal Reserve rate reduction next week.The index concluded Wednesday's trading at 20,034.89, representing a 1.8% daily increase.The current rally has benefited investors focused on growth and technology sectors, whilst raising concerns about elevated valuations and the increasing influence of large-capitalisation stocks within the index.""There is clearly an aspect of a chase into year-end, where the winners ... keep winning,"" stated Cameron Dawson, chief investment officer at NewEdge Wealth. ""The question is if this momentum can persist into 2025, where stretched valuations, positioning, sentiment, and growth expectations could all present high bars to jump over to keep above-average returns going.""Following its early 2020 decline during the pandemic-induced economic standstill, the index recovered swiftly as the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates to near-zero and the US government implemented substantial fiscal stimulus measures.The index experienced a significant decline in 2022, dropping 33% amidst 40-year high inflation rates and aggressive Federal Reserve rate increases. However, despite higher rates, the anticipated recession did not materialise, and the index has surged approximately 90% since then, partly due to growing enthusiasm about AI's commercial potential.Nvidia shares , whose chips are regarded as industry-leading, have increased more than 1,100% from their October 2022 low.""The AI story still rings true and appeals to investors,"" noted Alex Morris, chief investment officer of F/m Investments. ""These are the go-go stocks.""Despite the Nasdaq's increased valuation, it remains significantly below levels seen during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.The index currently trades at approximately 36 times earnings, a three-year peak exceeding its long-term average of 27, according to LSEG Datastream. This remains well below the roughly 70 times P/E ratio reached in March 2000, providing some reassurance to investors comparing the two periods.Large-capitalisation stocks increasingly dominate the index, with the top 10 companies representing 59% of the Nasdaq, compared to 45% in 2020. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia hold the largest weightings at 11.7%, 10.6%, and 10.3% respectively.Whilst their rising share prices have boosted the Nasdaq, this concentration could pose risks should large technology companies lose favour. The 2022 downturn saw significant declines in major components, with Meta and Tesla falling 64% and 65% respectively.The Nasdaq has outperformed other major US indices this year, driven by substantial gains in heavily weighted companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. Its 33% increase in 2024 surpasses the S&P 500's 27% and Dow Jones Industrial Average's 17% gains.Over the past decade, the Nasdaq has gained over 320%, compared to the S&P 500's 200% and the Dow's 150% increase.(With inputs from agencies)","The Nasdaq Composite Index reached 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday.

US core inflation stays firm with fourth-straight 0.3% increase,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-core-inflation-stays-firm-with-fourth-straight-0-3-increase/articleshow/116218462.cms,"File photo: Customers eat at the counter of the Lexington Candy Shop, in New York.

US consumer prices continued to rise in November at a pace that is fueling concerns the progress toward taming inflation is stalling.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — increased 0.3% for a fourth straight month, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Wednesday. From a year ago, it rose 3.3%.Traders continued to bet on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut next week after the figures came in largely as expected.Follow the reaction in real time here on Bloomberg’s TOPLive blogEconomists see the core gauge as a better indicator of the underlying inflation trend than the overall CPI that includes often-volatile food and energy costs. The headline measure rose 0.3% from the prior month and 2.7% from a year before. Shelter costs accounted for nearly 40% of the overall advance.While price pressures have subsided from a peak seen during the pandemic recovery, progress has leveled off more recently. That, along with receding concerns over the labor market, helps explain why several US central bankers have argued for a more gradual pace of interest-rate cuts.The CPI report showed goods costs excluding food and energy climbed 0.3%, the most since May 2023 and fueled by higher prices for new and used vehicles as well as apparel. That category had been a large driver of disinflation over the past year and a half.Grocery prices jumped 0.5%, the biggest advance since the start of last year.Economists have paid close attention to shelter prices, the largest category within services and one of the most persistent sources of inflation in recent years. That metric advanced 0.3% in November after a 0.4% gain in the prior month. Owners’ equivalent rent as well as rent of primary residence — subsets of shelter — both edged up 0.2%, the smallest gains since 2021.Excluding housing and energy, service prices rose 0.3% for a second month, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the overall inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure — known as the personal consumption expenditures price index — doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI, which is one reason why it’s trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target.A government report on producer prices due Thursday will offer insights into categories that feed directly into PCE, including health-care services, airfares and portfolio management.Policymakers also pay close attention to wage growth, as it can help inform expectations for consumer spending — the main engine of the economy. A separate report Wednesday that combines the inflation figures with recent wage data showed real hourly earnings grew 1.3% from a year ago.Part of the reason why Fed officials have indicated they’re in no rush to lower borrowing costs is because they no longer believe the labor market to be a source of inflation.Looking ahead, it remains to be seen to what extent President-elect Donald Trump ’s agenda will weigh on the trajectory of inflation. While consumers’ views of the economy and their finances have improved since he sealed his return to the White House, many economists say some of his campaign promises could put additional pressure on inflation. Some businesses, for example, are considering raising prices in anticipation of higher tariffs.","Core consumer price index increased 0.3% for a fourth straight month. From a year ago, it rose 3.3%.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

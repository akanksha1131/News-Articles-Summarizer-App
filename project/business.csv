Despite these challenges, India's quick commerce potential makes this IPO attractive for long-term investors, though business execution risks persist, the analysis says.Market analysts have diverse opinions regarding the Swiggy IPO, considering the company's present financial condition, market competition, and valuation metrics. However, the food delivery sector's growth potential makes it a considerable option for long-term investors.""As of the fiscal year 2024, Swiggy continues to operate at a loss, in contrast to its competitor, Zomato, which has recently achieved profitability. We advise investors to Avoid this IPO until the company's financial performance and growth outlook improve. Waiting until Swiggy demonstrates improved financial results and a clearer path to sustainable growth would be a more prudent investment approach,"" said Samco Securities.""Swiggy, at an upper price band of Rs 390.0, is valued at Price/Sales, EV/Sales and P/BV multiple of 7.8x/7.3x/7.1x respectively of its FY24 financials on post issue capital.

What will Donald Trump as US President mean for Indian stock markets? Top advantages & disadvantages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-will-donald-trump-as-us-president-mean-for-indian-stock-markets-top-advantages-disadvantages/articleshow/115005808.cms,"India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment.

Benefits of Trump's Potential Victory for India

Indian export sectors could gain significant advantages if Trump wins, as higher tariffs on Chinese products may enhance competitiveness of Indian manufacturers in areas like auto parts, solar equipment, and chemical production in US markets.

Energy costs might decrease due to Trump's fossil fuel policies and expected slower Chinese economic growth. This could positively impact Indian oil companies like HPCL, BPCL, IOC, and gas distribution firms such as IGL and MGL.

Manufacturing and defense sectors could experience growth as Trump's emphasis on US industrial development may benefit companies operating in both countries, including ABB, Siemens, Cummins, Honeywell, GE T&D, and Hitachi Energy.

Resolution of international tensions under Trump could improve supply chain efficiency, aiding Indian businesses. His focus on strengthening US manufacturing and military capabilities could provide opportunities for Indian defense companies like Bharat Dynamics and HAL.

The business climate could improve with Trump's leadership, potentially benefiting Indian equity markets through reduced corporate taxation, fewer regulatory requirements, and business-friendly policies.

Disadvantages for India due to Trump's Return:

A Trump presidency could trigger inflation, affecting Indian businesses through higher interest rates and increased costs for US-sourced materials and equipment. Economic experts anticipate that his proposed policies on tariffs, deportation, and deficit spending could cause inflationary pressures, resulting in immediate price increases and wage adjustments.

Trump's economic policies could strengthen the US dollar and increase bond yields through tax reductions and fiscal measures. This would attract global capital to the US, potentially weakening emerging market currencies including the Indian rupee. A stronger dollar would increase India's import expenses, particularly for oil, leading to higher domestic inflation.

Despite possible initial market gains, Trump's policy uncertainties could create extended market instability. Previous data shows US markets outperformed Indian markets during his first term, with Nasdaq gaining 77% compared to Nifty's 38%.

Previous restrictions on H-1B visas under Trump affected Indian IT companies through increased rejection rates and costs. However, these companies have adapted by increasing local US hiring and green card holders, reducing their vulnerability to future immigration restrictions.

Trump has criticized India's trade policies and suggested reciprocal tariffs. His administration could pressure India to reduce trade barriers, affecting sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. However, his efforts to reduce Chinese manufacturing dependence could benefit India.

The anticipated increase in the US fiscal deficit under Trump could lead to global inflation and higher interest rates, creating challenges for emerging markets' monetary policies. While India's domestic-focused economy provides some buffer, a Harris victory would likely maintain current economic frameworks with minimal disruption.

US election results : Republican candidate Donald Trump is projected to defeat Democrat candidate Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections, as per the latest counting trends. Indian equity markets have responded positively to Trump’s potential win. But what will the long-term impact of Trump at the White House be for Indian stock markets?A Republican sweep might trigger a short-term upswing in stock markets, primarily due to gains in US equity markets, as per Emkay Global's analysis.The Chinese markets, however, are expected to face heightened volatility and uncertainty during this period.India appears to be among the primary beneficiaries of Trump's presidency, particularly concerning economic and foreign policy matters. As Nomura's Sonal Verma states, ""We see India as a relative beneficiary, due to its domestic demand-driven growth model and benefits from lower commodity prices, supply chain shifts and on foreign policy.""The advantages India stands to gain from the current supply chain reorganisation, as companies reduce their dependence on China during Trump's administration, are likely to outweigh any potential challenges related to trade and immigration policies, according to Verma.According to an ET analysis, India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment positioning and increased capital flows, according to the brokerage firm's assessment.

(AI image)

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

DA hike calculator : PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has approved a 3% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) for central government employees on October 16, 2024. Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%. As a result of this latest hike, the DA and DR now stand at 53% for both central government employees and pensioners respectively. This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%. This rise in DA will lead to an increase in the take-home salary of central government employees starting from October 2024.The effective date for the increased DA and DR is July 1, 2024. The central government typically revises these allowances twice a year, in January and July, with official announcements being made at a later date. Consequently, the DA/DR hike is implemented retrospectively from the cut-off date of July 1, 2024.Also Read | Dearness allowance hiked!

MUMBAI: Creditors to defaulting companies facing bankruptcy proceedings can improve their recovery by 10% by pursuing avoidance transactions, Ravi Mital, chairman of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India , said. Avoidance transactions are deals entered into by promoters of defaulting companies to siphon money before the bankruptcy proceedings.During insolvency proceedings , the resolution professional managing the corporate entity on behalf of creditors is obliged to identify avoidance transactions. These include preferential, undervalued, extortionate or fraud deals entered into by the promoter where the benefit to the company is not seen.As of Sept end, 1,326 avoidance transaction applications involving an amount of nearly Rs 3.8 lakh crore have been filed with the tribunals, which can order for the amount to be clawed back. “The IBC has led to a direct recovery of about Rs 3.6 lakh crore due to resolution and Rs 10,446 crore due to liquidation till Sept 2024. The recovery from avoidance transactions will add to this recovery by the creditors. Till Sept, 338 avoidance transaction applications had been settled by the AA, ordering a claw back of about Rs 7,516 crore,” Mital said in an IBBI newsletter.","Avoidance transactions are deals entered into by promoters of defaulting companies to siphon money before the bankruptcy proceedings.

May ease tariffs if domestic companies not hurt: Finance minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/may-ease-tariffs-if-domestic-companies-not-hurt-finance-minister/articleshow/115229724.cms,"Union Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday indicated that govt may lift some tariffs if they don’t hurt domestic companies, asserting that there is a need to balance the interest of firms which need imported inputs as well those who are producing in the country.At an event organised by a news channel, Sitharaman said it was possible to explain every tariff that has been levied and these were not imposed to control imports.“Do we have a moral authority to kill or nip in the bud those who are growing in India and who can produce in India? I need to give them that protection as well as I have to encourage industries which need those imports,” Sitharaman said, while responding to a question on the US president-elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariff policy.Trump, who has campaigned on the issue of America First, had identified India as a “big import tariff charger”. In Sept, he described India as a “very big (trade) abuser”, bracketing it and Brazil just one notch below China. There are apprehensions that several exports from India to the US from sectors such as textiles, automobiles and pharmaceuticals could face high tariffs if Trump imposes reciprocal tariffs and make Indian goods uncompetitive in the US market.“Imports are required, intermediary goods are required to be imported. I will have to encourage that. I will lift the tariffs on them provided it doesn’t – intended or unintended – hurt my own capacity to produce. I will have to balance the two,” Sitharaman said.In the 2024-25 Budget, the FM had cut the basic customs duty on mobile phones, chargers and mobile printed circuit board assembly from 20% to 15%, stating that with a three-fold increase in domestic production and almost 100-fold jump in exports of mobile phones over the last six years, the Indian mobile phone industry had matured and asserted that the cut in import tariff was in the interest of consumers.Global agencies such as the IMF and the World Bank have pointed to India’s tariffs, saying there is a need to bring them down.The FM also said that India needs foreign direct investment but “need to make sure who exactly is bringing in that FDI.” and made it clear that while New Delhi welcomes FDI there has to be transparency on the source.",Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman indicated that govt may lift some tariffs if they don’t hurt domestic companies.

MUMBAI: Public sector banks have reported a collective net profit of Rs 45,545 crore for the Sept quarter, an increase of 35.4% over Rs 33,639 crore in the year-ago period. The operating profit for the first half of FY25 was Rs 1.5 lakh crore, up 14.4% year-on-year, while net profit stood at Rs 85,520 crore — a 25.6% increase over the same period and the highest in any half year, a govt statement said. The finance ministry issued the statement following a review meeting with public sector lenders to take stock of reforms.The increase in net profit was primarily driven by better asset quality, which lowered the provision requirement. Additionally, banks were relieved from the one-time staff cost provisions made in the previous year. Net interest income improved as credit growth surpassed deposit growth. A change in RBI regulations, treating penal interest as fees, boosted other income. Many banks also booked treasury profits and reversed previous mark-to-market provisions, benefiting from the decline in govt bond yields following India’s inclusion in global bond indices.In absolute terms, the biggest contribution to the incremental profit came from SBI, which reported a net profit of Rs 18,331 crore for the quarter, the highest among any listed entity.In percentage terms, the highest increase was reported by Punjab National Bank, whose net profit rose 145% to Rs 4,303 crore. Every PSU bank has reported a double digit increase in net profit in the quarter. Canara Bank recorded the lowest growth at 11% with a net profit of Rs 4,014 crore. Bank of Baroda had the second-highest net profit among all public sector lenders (Rs 5,237 crore).The improvement in financials has also increased the market value of PSU bank shares. The collective market cap of public sector banks stood at Rs 15.7 lakh crore. As of Sept 2024, the gross non-performing assets of PSBs was 3.12% and the net NPA was 0.63%, showing a year-on-year decline of 108 and 34 basis points respectively, according to the finance ministry. The capital adequacy ratio stood at 15.43%, well above the regulatory requirement of 11.5%. PSBs have also made strong progress in adopting new tech, the statement said.","Public sector banks have reported a collective net profit of Rs 45,545 crore for the Sept quarter.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001. The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.","Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime?

This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age.

Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

Known for his Telugu-accented English and dedicated teaching, Rama Sastri left a legacy in IIT lore, from humorous mess fee debates to a transformative MIT stint. Usha, Yale and Cambridge-educated, embodies this legacy, marrying JD Vance, Trump’s running mate. This milestone connects IIT’s academic heritage with the pinnacle of American politics.

The IITians



Flashback to 1954

A tall gangling young lecturer, Rama

Sastri

, with a very marked Telugu lilt to his English, taught us Physics at IIT Kharagpur. He was an excellent teacher, despite his accented English, and also served as the warden of Azad Hall.

A (hilarious) general body meeting of the hostel was held sometime late1954 to discuss burgeoning mess bills, which had climbed from rupees thirty to an astronomical forty rupees per month. Rama Sastri had to pacify the irate students.

He patiently explained the reasons for the increase 'What to do, everythingu become costly, ricu, saltu, pepperu, vegetablesu all cost more."" The students were mesmerised by the accent'u and kept quiet. The meeting passed off peacefully. The anecdote became part of the early IIT student lore as a memorable event'u!

Rama Sastri was deputed for a year to MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, on a post doctoral fellowship. He came back a changed man. He had broad shoulders (filled out thanks to nourishing US food) and sported a marked American accent. His bold visage was unrecognizable from the figure he cut a year earlier.

He sounded totally American until he came to the deadly word 'against' when he reverted to his original Telugu persona. He pronounced it as 'againistu,' and we were relieved that our beloved

Prof

had become normal.

Rama Sastri left IIT Kharagpur in the early sixties and joined the Physics Department of the newly set up IIT Madras. He retired years later as a much loved Professor after an excellent career. IIT Madras now runs a student award in his memory.

Rama Sastri's son,

graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree from IIT Madras in 1977 and later, in the 1980s, migrated to the US and is now a lecturer in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at San Diego State University.

One may wonder the reason for a long spiel about a Physics teacher of long ago: His granddaughter Usha was born in USA, graduated from Yale, did a Master's degree at Cambridge and later attended the Law School at Yale where she met and married a classmate. Usha Chilukuri is the wife of

JD Vance

, Trump's running mate.

Yes, the accomplished daughter of a Mechanical Engineer from IIT Madras and the granddaughter of a Physics teacher at IIT Kharagpur and IIT Madras is set to become the Second Lady of the USA!

Usha Chilukuri: A Trailblazer in the US



Indian Institutes of Technology ( IIT ) alumni, including leaders like Sundar Pichai, have greatly influenced US tech, finance, and entrepreneurship, driving innovation in major firms and startups. Their impact spans sectors, with IITians leading transformative ventures and shaping global industries through their technical expertise and leadership. And now there will be an IITian's progeny at the upper echleons of the US politics.One of the most desi US elections of all time ended with the Telugu brigade triumphing over the Tamil side as Trump-Vance beat Harris-Walz comprehensively. Usha Vance is poised to become the first Indian-origin Second Lady and across IIT campuses and alumni groups worldwide, there’s a palpable sense of pride and celebration as Usha Chilukuri, granddaughter of an IIT legend, steps into her role as the first Indian American Second Lady of the US. WhatsApp groups are lighting up with messages, memories, and heartfelt tributes, as alumni share stories of her grandfather, the beloved Professor Rama Sastri , whose Telugu-accented English and dedication made him an unforgettable figure in IIT’s early days.Rama Sastri, Usha’s grandfather, was an iconic figure in the early days of IIT Kharagpur. Arriving at the prestigious institution in 1954, he quickly became known not only for his exceptional teaching in Physics but also for his unique and memorable Telugu-accented English. His light-hearted approach and charismatic presence were well-received by students, particularly during a legendary general body meeting in Azad Hall, where students debated over a 10-rupee hike in the mess bill. As he humorously reassured students, citing the rising costs of “ricu, saltu, pepperu, vegetablesu,” his distinctive accent softened the tension, etching a fond memory into IIT’s early lore.Read: Why JD Vance is the future of MAGA In 1955, Rama Sastri earned a postdoctoral fellowship at MIT, where he gained a broader outlook and a slight American lilt, though students later remarked that his Telugu accent crept back at unexpected moments, reinforcing his endearing place in IIT’s heart. After a distinguished tenure at IIT Kharagpur, he joined IIT Madras, contributing to its budding Physics Department and eventually retiring as a revered professor. In his memory, IIT Madras now hosts a student award, a tribute to a lecturer who shaped countless careers.The IIT connection carried on with Rama Sastri’s son, Krish, who graduated in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Madras in 1977. He later moved to the US, where he currently lectures in Aerospace Engineering at San Diego State University. IIT alumni fondly recall the Sastri family’s legacy, appreciating the deep-rooted values of academia and intellectual rigor that each generation upheld. Now, as the IIT community watches Usha ascend to a national role, memories of her grandfather and father resonate strongly, with IITians reflecting on the impact of their work and presence.Usha Chilukuri’s journey to becoming the Second Lady is a testament to her dedication and intellect. Born in the US to an IIT graduate, she excelled academically, graduating from Yale, obtaining a Master’s from Cambridge, and returning to Yale Law School . It was there she met JD Vance, a rising political figure who is now the Republican vice-presidential candidate in the US. Together, they represent a new era, bringing with them the cultural and intellectual foundations of their heritage.As the first Indian American to serve as Second Lady of the US, Usha’s story is one that connects the rich tradition of IIT with the highest echelons of American politics. For IITians and many Indians, it is a moment of pride, reflecting how the academic roots nurtured in India can flourish internationally.This historic rise from the IIT classrooms of the 1950s to the global stage in 2024 marks a full-circle moment, one that not only honours Rama Sastri’s legacy but celebrates the bridge between tradition and progress that his family embodies. For Usha, this journey carries forward a legacy and adds a new chapter to the Sastri family’s enduring contribution to the worlds of academia, culture, and public service.","Usha Chilukuri is the wife of JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate.

With the current market gains for Bitcoin and other crypto assets, investors are expecting a good bull run in the 2025 cycle. Most analyses suggest that the upcoming bull run would kickstart from Bitcoin dominance. This is why many altcoins are on the rise, such as Rexas Finance (RXS), TRON , Bonk, Uniswap , Dogecoin, and Toncoin . This growth will stem from the decentralised economy to meme coins and will surely build up momentum for the next cycle.Rexas Finance (RXS) is raising capital by centering its business around the idea of adapting real-world physical assets to the blockchain. This approach appears promising, as the company has raised over $5.9 million in presale funding, following a presale of the token at $0.07. Unlike purely digital crypto space projects, Rexas Finance focuses on this core value proposition. As a microcap asset, Rexas Finance’s aims are relatively more attainable for other microcap stage investors, with a focus on tapping into real estate, precious metals, and other commodity token markets, allowing a wider array of investors to participate. Rexas Finance has created an investment utility that thrives on tokenisation using their Rexas token builder. This feature allows anyone to possess physical assets, which can then be tokenised and fully put onto the blockchain.Additionally, the platform offers a launchpad for new projects, enabling them to raise funds and grow within the Rexas ecosystem, making the platform even more interesting and useful. Rexas Estate , which deals effectively with real estate, works on the tokenisation of real-world real estate investments and merges them with a more modern real estate investment strategy. The latest campaign aimed at building a large dedicated community in Rexas Finance by rewarding early participants with a $1 million giveaway has already attracted many investors, thus enhancing the visibility of the token, which in turn appeals to investors seeking a utility token bound to increase due to its real-world purpose. With these features and practical applications, Rexas Finance appears to be an option for long-term growth and value-seeking customers.TRON is particularly noted for its advocacy of self-sovereignty of content delivered to users on the network, asserting its rights in the blockchain media and entertainment space. The price of TRON, currently trading at around $0.16, has made it the network of choice for many developers and content creators looking for a network with low fees and better scalability. Its ecosystem includes various decentralised applications, allowing content creators and developers in digital entertainment to effectively use the platform. Given the increasing appetite for decentralised media, TRON has an opportunity to grow its user base and scope of applications within the ecosystem in the upcoming 2025 bull cycle.Bonk is a recently launched meme coin that has gained popularity and can be seen as a cultural trend within the crypto ecosystem. Currently valued at $0.000022, Bonk combines the fun and entertainment aspects of a meme coin while also addressing potential use cases in the DeFi marketplace, giving it an edge over other coins. The intersection of the token’s strong network effects and the potential use of the coin within decentralised finance could help the token stay relevant and grow as demand for these types of coins increases.Uniswap has established itself as a key market client in decentralised finance, and its UNI tokens have become handy in the DeFi space. Currently trading at a price of closer to $9.20 and a little over 4.1 billion in terms of valuation, Uniswap still holds a position in the DEX protocol primarily because it allows its users to swap tokens from their wallets instead of having to use a centralised exchange. As DeFi continues to grow in number of users, it is reasonable to say that the amount of trades on UNI will also rise along with the usage of the platform.Although it began as a meme, it now has a market cap of $23 billion and a value of $0.19. Its primary utility today is as a digital currency, but its wide acceptance and use in retail and payment settings allow it to compete seriously with several global currencies. The highest growth potential for Dogecoin still seems ahead, largely thanks to strong community support.Toncoin, originating from Telegram’s blockchain, has become a major player in the DeFi space. Its current market cap is $4.71 billion, with a price of 12.9 billion tokens, which enables users to conduct high-speed transactions at low costs. Toncoin’s focus on expansion and enhancing user experience suggests it will remain key in meeting the rising demand for DeFi services.When trading tokens, each one has its own identity and purpose, whether it's Rexas Finance, TRON, Bonk, Uniswap, Dogecoin, or Toncoin. RXS’s real-world asset tokenisation model distinguishes it from others as a utility-focused project with high growth potential. As the 2025 bull run approaches, these six coins provide opportunities across various sectors—from real asset tokenisation and meme coin culture to DeFi. Early investors may want to keep a close watch on these tokens, as they are poised to bring significant returns and unique value propositions to the blockchain industry.For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the website and the whitepaper X and Telegram","Many altcoins are on the rise, such as Rexas Finance (RXS), TRON, Bonk, Uniswap, Dogecoin, and Toncoin.

The Rexas Finance token (RXS) is capturing attention with its strong price projections in the crypto market . This digital asset promises significant returns, fueled by innovative real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation strategies . Investors eyeing 2025 could see the RXS token reach $10, marking an impressive 5,000% increase from its launch. By 2030, experts project RXS to climb to $40, representing a remarkable 20,000% rise. Looking to 2040, the token is anticipated to exceed $100, driven by broad adoption across various asset classes, including real estate, commodities, and digital investments.Rexas Finance is revolutionising access to real-world asset markets. Through blockchain technology , it is transforming ownership by enabling users to tokenise high-value assets like real estate, gold, and more. Imagine an investor in Asia owning a percentage of an apartment in Europe or a fraction of a retail property in the US, with potential passive income from rentals and asset appreciation. Rexas Finance empowers this transformation with key tools like the Rexas Token Builder, allowing users to tokenise assets from real estate to precious metals. The platform’s QuickMint Bot, accessible on Telegram and Discord, streamlines this process further, simplifying token creation for users regardless of technical knowledge.Expanding its asset tokenisation vision, Rexas Finance also supports entrepreneurs and startups through its Launchpad, a platform for raising capital. With this feature, creators can launch their tokens and reach investors directly, bypassing traditional funding obstacles. This democratisation of finance allows a broader pool of projects to emerge, whether in real estate, commodities, or other investment areas. The Launchpad offers opportunities for public involvement in ventures traditionally dominated by institutional investors, fueling the wider adoption of blockchain-based investments. The progress of theRXS presale underscores investor interest, with the first four stages raising $5.45 million. Currently priced at $0.07 in stage five, the presale has now raised a total of $5,697,681. RXS has achieved a 2.3x price increase since stage one, and investors entering this stage are positioned for a potential 2.8x return on launch. Notably, the decision to bypass venture capital funding in favour of a public presale has enabled wider access to this ambitious project. With Rexas Finance now listed on major data tracking platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, it gains visibility across the crypto market, bolstering credibility and user participation. The RXS token will also be listed on 3 of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges, further boosting its visibility.At the heart of RXS is a comprehensive ecosystem supporting tokenised assets across industries. Rexas Estate exemplifies this expansion, offering tokenised property investments with options for fractional ownership . This model democratises real estate, previously accessible mainly to high-net-worth individuals, by allowing smaller investors to benefit from property investments with minimal capital. The platform’s tools, such as Rexas GenAI and Rexas AI Shield, add a layer of innovation, enhancing data protection and operational efficiency. Rexas GenAI powers automated insights and asset management solutions, while Rexas AI Shield focuses on security, ensuring a trustworthy investment environment. Together, these features create an ecosystem where traditional assets meet blockchain, enhancing accessibility, security, and ownership for users globally.Rexas Finance is at the forefront of a financial revolution, transforming how assets are accessed and owned in the crypto market. Combining the accessibility of fractional ownership with the security of blockchain redefines investment in real estate, commodities, and digital assets . With promising projections of $10 in 2025, $40 in 2030, and over $100 in 2040, RXS positions itself as a dynamic and compelling asset for investors. The platform’s ongoing innovations and presale momentum make RXS a valuable entry into the world of digital finance, inviting investors to seize this opportunity for significant future returns.","The Rexas Finance token (RXS) is capturing attention with its strong price projections in the crypto market.

Stretched rally

Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally took the digital asset past $89,000 and lifted the overall value of the crypto market above its pandemic-era peak as traders bet on a boom under US President-elect Donald Trump The largest token has jumped about 32% since the US election on November 5 and hit an all-time high of $89,599 early on Tuesday. The original cryptocurrency changed hands at $89,165 as of 9:25 am in Singapore.Trump has vowed friendlier crypto rules and his Republican Party is tightening its grip on Congress to push through his agenda. Other pledges include setting up a strategic US Bitcoin stockpile and boosting domestic mining of the token.His stance is a sharp break from a crackdown on the divisive industry by the Securities & Exchange Commission under President Joe Biden ’s administration. The shift has energized speculative buying of large and small tokens alike, raising the value of digital assets to about $3.1 trillion, CoinGecko data show.Bitcoin is in “beast mode,” Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group, wrote in a note. “The question for traders not already set is whether there is still room to chase this red-hot play or wait for a slight retracement and for some of the heat to come out of the impulsive trend.”In the options market, investors are lining up bets that Bitcoin will pass $100,000 as soon as the end of the year, according to data from the Deribit exchange. Meanwhile, software firm MicroStrategy Inc. — the largest publicly-traded corporate holder of Bitcoin outside the exchange-traded fund sector — bought about 27,200 Bitcoin for some $2 billion between October 31 and November 10.Traders for now are paying little heed to questions such as how quickly Trump will implement his agenda or whether a strategic stockpile is a realistic step.Bitcoin has more than doubled so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US ETFs and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the token exceeds the returns from investments such as global stocks and gold.Fairlead Strategies LLC technical analyst Katie Stockton in her latest research note said “it would be natural to see a period of digestion after such a steep run-up,” recommending a “short-term neutral bias.”Digital-asset companies spent heavily during the US election campaign to boost candidates viewed as favorable to their interests. Against that backdrop, Trump did an about-face, becoming a supporter of an industry he once labeled a scam.His backing turned Bitcoin into one of a range of so-called Trump trades. Others include US stocks and the dollar, both of which have also been advancing given Trump’s focus on domestic economic growth, tax cuts and protectionist tariffs.","The largest token has jumped about 32% since the US election on November 5.

Rising beyond the $160 level and gaining 13% over the past month, Solana (SOL) has shown fortitude. Due to its scalability and cheap transaction costs, Solana's total value locked (TVL) of $5.4 billion places it as a key competitor in the crypto industry, despite complaints regarding its centralising tendency. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance's presale, which sold over 114 million tokens in the past two months and drawn many investors with its creative strategy, has created a buzz. This has left crypto aficionados wondering: Can Solana reach $500, and what is the secret behind the presale numbers of Rexas Finance?With a weekly gain of 2.4%, Solana (SOL) has been creating waves; its price now exceeds the $160 barrier level to $165.97. Sol is under observation by traders and analysts since breaking above $160 could indicate continuous positive momentum. By the end of this month, some analysts estimate SOL might be worth $180. Technically, Solana's performance is reinforced by various indicators. Strong buying interest would be shown if SOL could cross its annual VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) and the crucial support level of $154. With estimates of over 100 million Solana wallets, the network's activity also recently underwent a spike. But since many of these wallets are empty, questions have surfaced over possible bot activity raising the network's measurements.Projections of SOL reaching $500 are highly pessimistic. Reaching this level requires SOL to overcome a sequence of important resistance levels, which could take a while. Solana's development has been noteworthy, especially with its rise from $22 to $120 over a year ago, but it remains to be seen if it can maintain the momentum needed to attain such high valuations in the distant future.While Solana draws interest, crypto billionaires and investors are also looking at Rexas Finance, a venture with record-breaking presale levels.Rising as a major competitor in the crypto space, Rexas Finance presents significant short-term profits when compared to more established initiatives like Solana. With Stage 4 alone bringing over $5.4 million and an amazing 130% return for early supporters in just two months, the presale for the project has attracted great interest. This expansion has attracted attention to Rexas Finance's creative strategy, presenting a special chance for investors. At its present price of $0.07, investors demonstrate great interest in the token, so the current presale stage 5 is presently 74% complete. With 114,732,875 tokens sold out of a targeted 155,000,000 and a total of $5,781,319 raised thus far out of a projected $8.6 million. This increase in demand demonstrates general belief in the project's ability to challenge established markets with a fresh vision for blockchain uses.Other elements driving the presale performance of Rexas Finance have been found by crypto experts. Recently, the site started a millionaire giveaway with a $1 million prize pool worth of RXS tokens. Twenty fortunate winners will get RXS tokens valued $50,000 apiece. Users must interact with the community to raise their chances of winning and enter their ERC20 wallet address on the Rexas Finance website (rexas.com). Particularly considering plans to offer the RXS token on three top-tier exchanges at a listing price of $0.20 in the first quarter of 2025, Rexas Finance has a bright future. For Stage 5 investors, this action promises a possible 186% increase; early supporters might see gains of more than 330%. Analysts estimate that considering the demand for the RXS token, it might rally up to 12000% by the end of 2025, therefore confirming its revolutionary nature in the crypto industry.Solana shows resiliency, but Rexas Finance makes a strong argument for those looking for quick gains. Rexas Finance seems poised to generate significant gains that could exceed even Solana's remarkable increase with its consistent presale performance, creative platform, and strategic listing policies.","Solana (SOL) has been creating waves; its price now exceeds the $160 barrier level to $165.97.

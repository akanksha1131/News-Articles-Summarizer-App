India-Oman trade deal: How the CEPA will anchor India’s expanding Gulf strategy; strengthen strategic and investment footprint,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-oman-trade-deal-how-the-cepa-will-anchor-indias-expanding-gulf-strategy-strengthen-strategic-and-investment-footprint/articleshow/126041593.cms,"'India-Oman FTA To Open Major Opportunities Across Key Sectors': Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal

India and Oman are set to sign a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) on December 18, a move that will deepen economic ties and anchor India’s expanding trade and strategic footprint in the Gulf, according to a report by the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).The agreement, to be inked in Muscat during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s three-nation tour, will cover goods, services and investment and is expected to be implemented after a few months. Negotiations began in November 2023 and the structure broadly follows India’s free-trade pact template with the United Arab Emirates, the GTRI report said.The CEPA aims to reduce or eliminate tariffs across a wide range of products, liberalise services trade and facilitate investment. Bilateral trade between India and Oman stood at about $10.5 billion in 2024–25, with India exporting $4.1 billion worth of goods and importing $6.6 billion, largely energy and fertiliser inputs.“For India, the agreement strengthens its economic and strategic presence in the Gulf, even as the trade gains are more incremental than transformative,” GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava noted, pointing to Oman’s small market size but significant geopolitical and energy importance.India’s export basket to Oman is led by naphtha ($747.6 million) and petrol ($561 million), along with calcined alumina, machinery, aircraft, rice, iron and steel articles, personal care products and ceramics. While more than 80% of Indian goods already enter Oman at an average tariff of around 5%, duties on some items range up to 100%. Tariff elimination under the CEPA is expected to improve competitiveness for Indian industrial exports, though sustained growth will depend on product quality and differentiation, the report noted.Oman, in turn, stands to gain from improved access to the Indian market for energy and industrial inputs. India’s imports from Oman in FY2025 were dominated by crude oil, liquefied natural gas and fertilisers, each valued at about $1.1 billion. Chemical inputs such as methyl alcohol and anhydrous ammonia, along with petroleum coke, are critical for India’s agriculture, chemicals, cement and power sectors. Many of these products already face low duties under India’s other trade agreements, suggesting the CEPA will reinforce existing supply chains rather than radically alter trade flows.Beyond tariffs, the agreement covers a wide negotiating agenda, including intellectual property, government procurement, digital trade, rules of origin, customs cooperation, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, dispute settlement and support for small and medium-sized enterprises. These provisions are aimed at easing non-tariff barriers and improving predictability for businesses on both sides.India is also expected to seek streamlined approval pathways for pharmaceutical products already cleared by regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration, the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the European Medicines Agency, mirroring provisions in its UAE agreement.Despite the limitations posed by Oman’s population of about five million and GDP of roughly $115 billion, the CEPA carries strategic weight. With more than 6,000 India–Oman joint ventures and Indian investments exceeding $7.5 billion, particularly in the Sohar and Salalah free zones, the pact is as much about geopolitics and regional presence as it is about trade volumes, the GTRI report said.",India and Oman are set to sign a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) on December 18. The move will deepen economic ties and anchor India’s expanding trade and strategic footprint in the Gulf.

US Social Security alarm: Trump administration may force 39 states for repayment to foster kids — Check reasons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-social-security-alarm-trump-administration-may-force-39-states-for-repayment-to-foster-kids-check-reasons/articleshow/126041192.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The US administration for children and families (ACF) under the department of health and human services wrote to the governors of 39 states, calling on them to safeguard Social Security benefits meant for children in foster care.In letters sent on Thursday, the ACF flagged concerns alleging that state child welfare agencies are collecting Social Security survivor and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits owed to foster children and using the funds to offset foster care costs, rather than preserving them for the children.“Every earned benefit dollar belongs to these foster youth, not government agencies or bureaucrats,” ACF Assistant Secretary Alex J. Adams said, stressing that protecting children must remain central to child welfare policy, as reported by Economic Times quoting Daily Express US.Idaho has discontinued the practice under Adams’ leadership, joining ten other states that have enacted policies protecting foster children’s benefits. The federal authorities are now working on ways to reform practices in the states where benefit collection continues.According to a Social Security Advisory Report, published in September, cited by Daily Express US, around 27,000 foster children, i.e. more than 5 per cent of the total foster care population receive Social Security or SSI benefits. Several states routinely divert these funds, saving millions in foster care expenditure, according to the Associated Press.Social Security survivor benefits are based on lifetime contributions made by deceased parents and are considered a critical financial resource for affected children. The agency is now seeking to ensure that benefits are preserved for foster children, particularly as they transition out of state care.The issue has drawn political attention in recent years. In March 2024, Senator Elizabeth Warren raised the matter during a Senate hearing, calling for a ban on states collecting foster children’s survivor benefits. She claimed states had taken at least $179 million from foster children in 2018 alone to fund unrelated state expenses.Warren alleged that some states screen children in foster care for Social Security eligibility—sometimes using data-mining firms—and divert the proceeds into state budgets. “Those benefits are being used for everything from office supplies to prisons,” she said.","The US administration for children and families (ACF) under the department of health and human services wrote to the governors of 39 states, calling on them to safeguard Social Security benefits meant for children in foster care.

This trend is likely to continue in early 2026, and this will favour non-AI markets like India.

How the corpus thresholds work

Accumulated pension wealth above Rs 12 lakh: At least 20 per cent of the corpus must be used to purchase an annuity, while up to 80 per cent can be withdrawn as a lump sum.

Greater control over retirement savings

New NPS rules: In a significant overhaul of retirement withdrawal norms, exiting the National Pension System (NPS) has become more flexible for non-government subscribers.Under amended rules notified by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), eligible NPS members can now withdraw up to 80 per cent of their retirement corpus as a lump sum at the time of exit, reported Economic Times.The revised rules apply to subscribers under the All Citizen Model and Corporate NPS, bringing major relief to non-government sector employees who were earlier required to allocate a larger share of their savings to annuity purchases.As per the amended PFRDA (Exits and Withdrawals under the NPS) Regulations, 2025, notified on December 16, the compulsory annuity purchase requirement for non-government subscribers has been reduced to a minimum of 20 per cent of the accumulated pension wealth in specified cases.Annuities provide regular pension income after retirement, while the remaining portion of the corpus can be withdrawn as a lump sum or through systematic unit withdrawal.Earlier, non-government NPS subscribers had to use at least 40 per cent of their retirement corpus to buy an annuity on exit.The revised annuity requirement applies to normal exits at the age of 60, exits after completing the minimum subscription period, and exits between the ages of 60 and 85.For subscribers whose accumulated pension wealth crosses certain monetary thresholds, at least 20 per cent of the corpus must be set aside for annuity purchase, while up to 80 per cent becomes available for withdrawal.The amended regulations lay down different withdrawal rules based on the size of the retirement corpus:By lowering the mandatory annuity component from 40 per cent to 20 per cent, the PFRDA has given non-government NPS subscribers greater control over how they use their retirement savings. The move increases liquidity at exit and allows retirees more flexibility in planning post-retirement income, while still ensuring a minimum assured pension through annuity purchase.",National Pension System (NPS) has become more flexible for non-government subscribers.

"Wages up, prices down: Trump says he ‘fixed’ US economy — here’s how his favourite word ‘tariffs’ fits in",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wages-up-prices-down-trump-says-he-fixed-us-economy-heres-how-his-favourite-word-tariffs-fits-in/articleshow/126049122.cms,"‘Mess Like This…’: Trump Addresses America, Makes Big Statement On Venezuela

Trump’s favourite word — Tariffs!



Fuels, food, wages — What changed in Trump’s term?



US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) delivered a live address from the White House, highlighting the financial and economic achievements he achieved in his second term. Much of the speech centred on inflation, trade policy, tariffs and household finances, alongside sharp criticism of the previous Democrat administration.Beginning his address, Trump highlighted that he took office at a time of severe economic strain, arguing that Americans were struggling with high prices and declining affordability.“America, 11 months ago, I inherited a mess and I'm fixing it. When I took office, inflation was the worst in 48 years, and some would say in the history of our country, which caused prices to be higher than ever before, making life unaffordable for millions and millions of Americans. This happened during a Democrat administration, and it's when we first began hearing the word affordability,” he said.The president repeatedly targeted the Biden administration over inflation and public spending, accusing it of draining the US treasury and driving up everyday costs.He went on to criticise earlier trade deals, saying that the United States had lost economic standing on the global stage. However, after Trump began his second term as a president, the country was no longer being “laughed at"" from all over the world.He highlighted what he described as record levels of investment flowing into the United States, linking this directly to his trade and tariff policies. “Already, I've secured a record-breaking $18 trillion of investment into the United States, which means jobs, wage increases, growth, factory openings, and far greater national security,” he said.He described tariffs as a central tool of his economic strategy, arguing that they had encouraged companies to relocate manufacturing back to the US.“Much of this success has been accomplished by tariffs, my favorite word, tariffs, which, for many decades, have been used successfully by other countries against us, but not anymore. Companies know that if they build in America, there are no tariffs, and that's why they're coming home to the USA in record numbers. They're building factories and plants at levels we haven't seen, AI, automobiles.”The US President claimed that the economic turnaround had been dramatic.“We're doing what nobody thought was even possible, not even remotely possible. There has never, frankly, been anything like it. One year ago, our country was dead. We were absolutely dead. Our country was ready to fail. Totally failed.”Alongside foreign policy claims, the president said the domestic economy had been brought back “from the brink of ruin”, again blaming previous leadership for rising prices across key sectors.“The last administration and their allies in Congress looted our Treasury for trillions of dollars, driving up prices and everything at levels never seen before. I am bringing those high prices down and bringing them down very fast,” he said.Trump listed a series of price increases he attributed to the Biden years, including cars, fuel, hotel rates and airfares, before claiming those costs were now falling.“Under the Biden administration, car prices rose 22% and, in many states, 30% or more. Gasoline rose 30 to 50%. Hotel rates rose 37%. Airfares rose 31%. Now, under our leadership, they are all coming down and coming down fast.”He also referred to food prices, citing declines in the cost of groceries.“The price of a Thanksgiving turkey was down 33% compared to the Biden last year. The price of eggs is down 82 percent since March, and everything else is falling rapidly. And it's not done yet, but, boy, are we making progress.”Energy costs featured prominently in the speech, with Trump saying households had borne heavy losses under the previous administration.“Electricity costs surged 30 to 100 percent under Biden. And the typical family lost $5,000 to $10,000 in higher energy costs,” he said, adding that he had declared a national energy emergency on his first day in office.He claimed fuel prices had since dropped sharply. “Gasoline is now under $2.50 a gallon in much of the country. In some states, it, by the way, just hit $1.99 a gallon.”Turning to wages and incomes, Trump said his policies were boosting take-home pay after years of decline.“After years of record-setting falling incomes, our policies are boosting take-home pay at a historic pace,” he said, adding that “under Biden, real wages plummeted by $3,000”.He said factory workers were now seeing wage increases of $1,300, while construction workers were gaining $1,800, stressing that “wages are going up much faster than inflation”.The president also highlighted a major tax package, describing it as “one beautiful bill”, which combined multiple measures including “no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors”.He said these changes would save many families between $11,000 and $20,000 a year and lead to what he described as the largest tax refund season on record.Linking tariffs to government revenue, Trump announced a special payment for military personnel.“Because of tariffs, along with the just-passed, one big, beautiful bill, tonight I am also proud to announce that more than 1,450,000 — think of this, 1,450,000 — military service members will receive a special we call warrior dividend before Christmas,” he said.“We are sending every soldier $1,776,” he added, stating that the payments were already being issued.Closing his address, Trump said the combination of falling prices, rising wages and trade-driven revenue had restored America’s economic position.“Wages are up. Prices are down. Our nation is strong. America is respected. And our country is back, stronger than ever before. We're poised for an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen.”","US President Donald Trump delivered a live address from the White House on Wednesday.

JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that he has approved a $35 billion natural gas export deal to Egypt, the biggest gas deal in Israeli history. The agreement could also help repair relations between the two countries strained during the two-year war in the Gaza Strip.The gas will be delivered to Egypt over the next 15 years by U.S. energy giant Chevron, a key owner of the gas field off Israel's coast in the Mediterranean Sea. Half of the proceeds are expected to go to Israel's state coffers.In a recorded video statement, Netanyahu said the deal ""greatly strengthens Israel's position as a regional energy power, and it contributes to stability in our region.""Egypt, which borders both Israel and Gaza, has served as a key mediator between Israel and the Palestinian militant Hamas group leading up to the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that was agreed on in October. Cairo has also has been a vocal critic of Israel's offensive, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction in Gaza.Egypt did not immediately confirm Netanyahu's announcement.Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen, a close Netanyahu ally, previously held up the deal with Egypt, claiming the terms were not favorable to Israel. His delays prompted U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to cancel a trip to Israel in October.But Cohen stood alongside Netanyahu during the Wednesday evening announcement and said he supported the final terms of the deal.Israel discovered sizeable natural gas fields off its Mediterranean coast in the early 2000s and began exporting gas - first to Jordan and later to Egypt - nearly a decade ago.In a separate development, German lawmakers approved an expansion of a defense agreement for Israel's sophisticated Arrow 3 missile defense system, Israel's defense ministry said Wednesday.The expansion brings the value of the deal from $3.5 billion to $6.5 billion, making it the largest Israeli defense export deal ever, according to the ministry. Germany moved to buy Arrow 3 from Israel as it seeks to strengthen its air defenses against Russia.",The gas will be delivered to Egypt over the next 15 years by U.S. energy giant Chevron.

India Inc may witness 9% salary rise in 2026: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-inc-may-witness-9-salary-rise-in-2026-report/articleshow/126048657.cms,".

New Delhi: India Inc is projected to post 9% salary growth in 2026, with auto and high tech (product and consulting) leading the trend, according to global HR consulting firm, Mercer India.Salary increases this year were largely in the high single-digit range, aligned with a moderating economic environment.From a global perspective, India continues to stand out as one of the fastest-growing salary markets, significantly outpacing developed economies, such as the US, UK, Europe and Japan, where salary growth typically ranges between 2% and 4%, Malathi KS, Mercer’s Rewards Consulting Leader India, told TOI.According to Mercer’s annual Total Remuneration Survey 2026, organisations are continuing to refine their rewards packages, with a focus on short-term incentives, moving toward more transparent, skills acquisition and deployment-based systems. Short-term incentives like bonuses have led to a stronger emphasis on near-term performance alignment, cost efficiency, and building transparent, skills-based pay frameworks to support evolving workforce needs in the face of AI and productivity priorities, it said.Further, the IT, ITES, and global capability centers (GCC) sector in India continues to lead the way in offering innovative and progressive employee benefits reflecting the sector’s commitment to enhancing employee well-being and engagement.The survey covers remuneration trends across 8,000 roles and in over 1,500 companies in the country.Despite a tougher economic outlook, the key factors influencing salary increases in 2026 remain unchanged, with individual performance, an employee’s position within the salary range, inflation and an organisation’s competitiveness in the job market continuing to drive pay decisions, it noted.","Salary increases this year were largely in the high single-digit range, aligned with a moderating economic environment.

$1.5 billion revenue from AI services: TCS CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/1-5-billion-revenue-from-ai-services-tcs-ceo/articleshow/126048636.cms,".

Bengaluru: TCS CEO K Krithivasan has said annualised revenue from AI services reached $1.5 billion, growing 16.3% quarter-on-quarter. Over 85% of clients with revenues above $20 million leverage TCS for AI work.""A massive internal transformation is underway, and we are encouraging all our associates to adopt an AI-first culture. Every time we take on a project or engage with a customer, the first question we ask is: What can AI do here? Can AI do this better than what we are doing today-even if it ends up cannibalising our own revenue?""That is what we define as an AI-first culture-giving AI the first right of refusal before considering any other option. Alongside this, we are building our own AI solutions and scaling them,"" he said at the TCS analyst day in Mumbai on Wednesday.Other large Indian IT companies have not yet highlighted AI revenue separately. In comparison, global peer Accenture moved faster to build next-generation capabilities. Accenture highlighted that its decision in FY23 to commit $3 billion over multiple years to lead in generative AI is paying off.In FY25, revenue from generative and agentic AI tripled to $2.7 billion from FY24, while bookings nearly doubled to $5.9 billion. It also grew its security revenue to $10 billion in the 2025 fiscal from a mere $700 million ten years ago. Other Indian IT companies have called out some AI-led deal wins, while the rest have shared commentary on budgets increasingly being redirected toward AI-led projects.Krithivasan said AI is becoming a core growth engine across TCS' portfolio. AI services are growing at 38.2% year-on-year in constant currency, significantly faster than other segments such as interactive, cybersecurity, cloud, enterprise solutions, and IoT & digital engineering. Overall, TCS showcased $11 billion in annualised revenue across these services.TCS said AI-led transformation is anchored in five strategic pillars: internal transformation, by becoming its own first customer and embedding an AI-first culture; AI-led service reimagination which involves redefining every service line with AI at core; talent transformation through large-scale reskilling, team restructuring and new delivery models; reimagining customer value chains with focus on driving end-to-end business transformation rather than incremental productivity gains; and ecosystem partnerships by partnering, acquiring, and co-creating with broader ecosystem to move at speed.""The shift from digital to AI presents a massive opportunity-for enterprises and for TCS. Our differentiated strategy, deep customer partnerships, execution discipline, and strong balance sheet position us well to lead this transformation,"" he added. TCS COO Aarthi Subramanian said while TCS has long invested in strong learning infrastructure, it has now introduced a personalised AI learning coach. ""Powered by generative and agentic AI, it understands an employee's skill level, aspirations, and goals, and provides tailored guidance across technical and soft skills. This is already delivering strong results.""Subramanian said 180,000 possess higher-order AI skills, nearly doubling from last year. ""Role transformation is equally critical. Every role-from sales to delivery-is becoming AI-centric. We have launched the AI Dojo programme across sales, advisory, and delivery teams, while also introducing new roles such as rapid-build engineers."" Subramanian, however, reiterated that in Level 2 and Level 3 tasks (mid order tasks), agents continue to play supportive roles, with humans remaining at the forefront.",TCS CEO K Krithivasan said annualised revenue from AI services reached $1.5 billion.

NCLAT needs to dispose of appeals within 3 mths: Panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nclat-needs-to-dispose-of-appeals-within-3-mths-panel/articleshow/126048623.cms,".

New Delhi: Amid increasing delays, the select committee of Parliament examining the bill to amend the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code has recommended that The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) should dispose of appeals within three months of their receipt.“…IBC presently does not prescribe any statutory timelines for the disposal of appeals by NCLAT. This gap has resulted in delays, particularly in appeals challenging the rejection of claims during the CIRP (corporate insolvency resolution process) or liquidation processes, as well as appeals concerning the approval or rejection of resolution plans. The committee further noted that the Amendment Bill also fails to introduce any specific statutory timelines for the NCLAT,” the panel said in its report.The 24-member committee of lawmakers, headed by BJP’s Bijayant Panda, has also backed govt’s move to provide that the National Company Law Tribunal should admit a petition within 14 days and initiate the resolution process after it is convinced that there is payment default and other procedural requirements are fulfilled. But it also pointed to the lack of infrastructure in the tribunals, which was resulting in a massive delay in deciding cases.In addition, the ministry of corporate affairs has assured the panel that it will draft regulations “after carefully calibrating the infrastructure, functional and administrative requirements” to ensure that the timelines provided under the law are met.Against the 270 days provided under the law, the 1,300 cases where resolution has taken place have on an average taken 603 days. In fact, 77% of the nearly 1,900 ongoing cases have taken more than 270 days, according to the latest available official data.On group insolvency, which is sought to be operationalised, the committee pointed out that the bill provides for constitution of a common bench, mechanisms for coordination between committees of creditors and professionals, appointment of a group coordinator, formation of a combined committee of creditors, and the execution of binding coordination. It said that the rules should be tailored to India’s unique institutional environment, which includes factors like promoter-driven litigation, related-party influence, and the inherent complexity of cross-entity claims.","The select committee of Parliament examining the bill to amend the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code has recommended that The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) should dispose of appeals within three months of their receipt.

PFRDA allows up to 80% NPS withdrawal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pfrda-allows-up-to-80-nps-withdrawal/articleshow/126048599.cms,".

New Delhi: In a major overhaul of the National Payment System (NPS), the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has allowed subscribers from the private sector to withdraw up to 80% of the accumulated corpus, instead of 60% earlier, with the rest to be used to purchase annuities to earn a pension.Subscribers have the option to stay in NPS until 85 years, instead of 75 years earlier, and the regulator reiterated allowing systematic unit redemption, which are akin to systematic withdrawal plans offered by mutual funds. Systematic unit redemption can be used only from the 80% permitted withdrawal.Besides, four withdrawals, instead of three, have been allowed till the subscriber turns 60 years, making it possible for individuals to dip into the corpus to meet requirements, such as education, house purchase or weddings.There is, however, need for clarity on the tax treatment as only 60% withdrawal is currently tax-free. Govt may amend the law to provide for 80% withdrawal free of taxes.The revised limit is applicable to those, who have been subscribers for 15 years or more or are retiring. Those with a corpus of up to Rs 8 lakh will be allowed to withdraw the entire balance, against Rs 5 lakh cut off earlier. The limit for full withdrawal has been changed as annuity sellers do need a minimum purchase value of Rs 2 lakh, said an industry source.Those with an accumulated balance of Rs 8-12 lakh, will have the option to withdraw up to Rs 6 lakh as lump sum or avail periodic payouts in the form of systematic lump sum withdrawal or systematic unit redemption.","The regulator reiterated allowing systematic unit redemption, which are akin to systematic withdrawal plans offered by mutual funds.

Bengaluru: Meesho’s shares closed at Rs 216.3 on Wednesday on the NSE, hitting the 20% upper circuit and nearly doubling their IPO price within days of debut. The e-commerce company’s stock has gained about 95% since it got listed on Dec 10 at Rs 111 per share. The surge, which has pushed the company’s market cap to Rs 98,000 crore, makes Meesho rank among top-performing IPOs of 2025.The stock surged to its upper circuit early in the day and remained locked there through the close, with over 18 crore shares traded. Its rally comes amid an active period for primary and secondary market activity, with investor appetite remaining strong for consumer internet and technology-led businesses.Separately, global brokerage UBS initiated coverage on the stock earlier this week with a buy rating, though market participants said the latest move appeared driven largely by post-listing momentum and demand for newly listed consumer-facing companies.The rally follows sharp gains in the stock earlier this week, which took co-founder and CEO Vidit Aatrey’s personal stake beyond the $1-billion mark. Shares rose over 70% from the IPO price in the first few sessions after listing.","Mesho’s shares closed at Rs 216.3 on Wednesday on the NSE, hitting the 20% upper circuit and nearly doubling their IPO price.

"RBI rescue: Rs rises 65p to 90.38/$, best day in 2 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-rescue-rs-rises-65p-to-90-38/-best-day-in-2-months/articleshow/126048523.cms,".

Mumbai: The rupee bounced back to close at 90.38 against the dollar, up 65 paise from Tuesday’s close of 91.03, following aggressive intervention by RBI. The rupee rose as much as 1% during the day, recovering to a high of 90.08, marking its biggest single-session gain in two months. The move reversed part of the sharp depreciation seen in recent weeks, during which the currency had repeatedly touched new lows.Market participants said the intervention followed growing speculation over the timing and scale of RBI action after the rupee’s sustained slide. The central bank had earlier conducted a $5 billion dollar-buy swap, which traders said may have set the stage for Wednesday’s spot market intervention.Dealers said the dollar sales appeared aimed at countering one-sided expectations of continued rupee weakness. In its market interventions, the central bank has often used surprise to maximise the impact of its measures.According to a report by SBI, the impact of a depreciating currency on the current trade balance is limited. Although India’s goods exports saw a 19.4% growth in November 2025, empirical analysis shows that the benefits of increased export volumes are largely offset by the rising cost of imports.The report said the rapid slide has led to unprecedented demand for dollars in the merchant segment, with combined excess demand reaching $145 billion. To curb this volatility, RBI has intervened significantly. The report estimated that RBI deployed approximately $30 billion between June and Oct 2025, contributing to a decline in forex reserves from a peak of $703 billion in June to $687.2 billion by early Dec.According to the SBI report, there could be a strong rebound in the second half of the next fiscal year. Two scenarios are anticipated: a continued depreciation towards 92.5 per dollar by mid-2026, or a recovery in which the rupee appreciates by about 6.5% to average around 87 per dollar.","The rupee bounced back to close at 90.38 against the dollar, up 65 paise from Tuesday’s close of 91.03.

Warner Bros deal battle: Company tells shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance bid; Netflix deal preferred,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/takeover-tussle-warner-bros-tells-shareholders-to-reject-paramount-skydance-bid-netflix-deal-preferred/articleshow/126039512.cms,"Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS

Warner Bros has asked its shareholders to reject a hostile takeover bid from Paramount Skydance, saying a rival offer from Netflix would be better for customers and aligns with the board’s fiduciary responsibilities, AP reported.In a letter to investors issued on Wednesday, Warner Bros said its board had reviewed Paramount Skydance’s “unsolicited tender offer” with the same scrutiny applied to earlier proposals. “The Board’s evaluation followed a thorough and consistent process and is grounded in its fiduciary duties,” the company said.Paramount went hostile last week after Warner Bros agreed to a deal with Netflix on December 5, urging shareholders to back its offer instead. Paramount has offered $30 per Warner share, higher than Netflix’s $27.75 bid.While the board has made clear that Paramount’s proposal is not its preferred option, shareholders still have the choice of tendering their shares to Paramount for the entire company, including cable networks such as CNN and Discovery.A key difference between the two bids is scope. Netflix’s offer does not include Warner Bros’ cable operations and would be completed only after the company carries out its previously announced separation of those assets.Paramount’s bid, by contrast, seeks to acquire Warner’s cable networks and news businesses.Paramount has said it made six separate offers that were rejected by Warner’s leadership before taking its proposal directly to shareholders. Both bids now face intense regulatory scrutiny, given the scale of the companies involved and the potential impact on the entertainment and media industry, AP reported.Critics of the Netflix deal argue that combining Netflix with Warner’s HBO Max could create excessive market dominance in streaming. Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos rejected that view in a filing through Warner Bros, saying, “Our stance then and now is the same—we see this as a win for the entertainment industry, not the end of it.”Concerns have also been raised about how either deal could affect film and television production, as well as editorial control. Paramount’s bid would bring CBS and CNN under one corporate umbrella, intensifying scrutiny over media consolidation and newsroom independence.The political dimension has added further uncertainty. US President Donald Trump has indicated that regulatory approval could be influenced by politics and has publicly questioned Netflix’s bid, saying it “could be a problem” because of potential market concentration. Trump has also continued to criticise Paramount over editorial decisions at CBS’ “60 Minutes”.Paramount Skydance did not immediately respond to a request for comment from AP.","Paramount went hostile last week after Warner Bros agreed to a deal with Netflix.

Hong Kong's biggest licensed cryptocurrency exchange began trading Wednesday as the city pushes to become a global hub for digital units despite Beijing's tough stance on the technology.While trading and mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is banned in mainland China, eye-catching adverts for the sector are a common sight in semi-autonomous Hong Kong.Authorities there have taken steps to regulate the fast-evolving industry in a bid to get ahead of other financial centres such as Dubai and Singapore.Shares in HashKey Group, which was established in 2018 and runs an exchange alongside other ventures, ended the morning down 2.69 percent at HK$6.50 (US$0.84) on its market debut, having raised US$205 million in its initial public offering.CEO Xiao Feng hailed the debut as a ""glorious day"" that showed how ""taking the compliant route can also lead to success"".""As entrepreneurs, we come from mainland (China), but HashKey is a homegrown Hong Kong company,"" Xiao said at its listing ceremony.""We firmly believe that even in the digital asset industry, a complete set of regulatory rules -- built on centuries of human societal experience -- is essential,"" he added.Hong Kong is seen as an experimental field for using cryptocurrencies as mainstream investment tools.Earlier this year the city launched a licensing system for stablecoins, a less volatile type of digital unit.""China is still quite careful of the use of cryptocurrency,"" Merton Lam, head of the digital asset firm Crypto HK, told AFP.So the world's second-largest economy likely sees Hong Kong as ""a testing ground"" for the technology, he said.""Crypto is a global thing"" and people in Hong Kong can already use major international exchanges such as Binance, but local operators like HashKey can be convenient for those who want to transfer cash into crypto, Lam added.Etelka Bogardi, a financial technology lawyer at Reed Smith, said the timing was good for HashKey given the ""very buoyant IPO market"" but the city's crypto-friendly policies had also played a role.""Hong Kong in particular in the last 12, 18 months has really pushed ahead with a lot of regulations, clarifications, pushes by the administration to make it a more facilitative environment"" for blockchain technology, she told AFP.",Hong Kong's biggest licensed cryptocurrency exchange began trading Wednesday.

Trump expands travel ban and restrictions to include an additional 20 countries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-expands-travel-ban-and-restrictions-to-include-an-additional-20-countries/articleshow/126029802.cms,"Trump Travel Ban Explodes: US Immigration Crackdown Continues With New Proclamation | FULL LIST

The Trump administration announced Tuesday it was expanding travel restrictions to an additional 20 countries and the Palestinian Authority, doubling the number of nations affected by sweeping limits announced earlier this year on who can travel and emigrate to the USThe Trump administration included five more countries as well as people traveling on documents issued by the Palestinian Authority to the list of countries facing a full ban on travel to the US and imposed new limits on 15 other countries.The move is part of ongoing efforts by the administration to tighten US entry standards for travel and immigration, in what critics say unfairly prevents travel for people from broad range of countries. The administration suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.People who already have visas, are lawful permanent residents of the US or have certain visa categories such as diplomats or athletes, or whose entry into the country is believed to serve the US interest are all exempt from the restrictions. It was not immediately clear when the new restrictions would take effect.In June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from coming to the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions. The decision resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term.At the time the ban included Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.On Tuesday, the Republican administration announced it was expanding the list of countries whose citizens are banned from entering the US to Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria. The administration also fully restricted travel on people with Palestinian-Authority-issued travel documents, the latest US travel restriction against Palestinians. South Sudan was also facing significant travel restrictions already.An additional 15 countries are also being added to the list of countries facing partial restrictions: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Ivory Coast, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe.The restrictions apply to both people seeking to travel to the US as visitors or to emigrate there.The Trump administration said in its announcement that many of the countries from which it was restricting travel had ""widespread corruption, fraudulent or unreliable civil documents and criminal records"" that made it difficult to vet their citizens for travel to the USIt also said some countries had high rates of people overstaying their visas, refused to take back their citizens who the US wished to deport or had a ""general lack of stability and government control,"" which made vetting difficult. It also cited immigration enforcement, foreign policy and national security concerns for the move.The Afghan man accused of shooting the two National Guard troops near the White House has pleaded not guilty to murder and assault charges. In the aftermath of that incident, the administration announced a flurry of immigration restrictions, including further restrictions on people from those initial 19 countries who were already in the USThe news of the expanding travel ban is likely to face fierce opposition from critics who have argued that the administration is using national security concerns to collectively keep out people from a wide range of countries.""This expanded ban is not about national security but instead is another shameful attempt to demonize people simply for where they are from,"" said Laurie Ball Cooper, Vice President of US Legal Programs at the International Refugee Assistance Project.The Trump administration also upgraded restrictions on some countries - Laos and Sierra Leone - that previously were on the partially restricted list and in one case - Turkmenistan - said the country had improved enough to warrant easing some restrictions on travelers from that country. Everything else from the previous travel restrictions announced in June remains in place, the administration said.The new restrictions on Palestinians comes months after the administration imposed limits that make it nearly impossible for anyone holding a Palestinian Authority passport from receiving travel documents to visit the US for business, work, pleasure or educational purposes.

WTO can't be forum to solve trading problems: US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wto-cant-be-forum-to-solve-trading-problems-us/articleshow/126028659.cms,".

New Delhi: Virtually denouncing the World Trade Organisation WTO ), the US has blamed the Geneva-based body for creating global imbalances and said that it cannot be the forum to solve existing and future problems of the trading system.""The US has serious concerns with the trading system embodied by the WTO, given that the system has overseen and contributed to a world of severe and sustained imbalances. These imbalances, which are driven in part by overcapacity and concentration of production, have created dangerous dependencies and vulnerabilities for many countries and have undermined many countries' legitimate aspirations to develop or maintain industrial capacity,"" it said in a paper on reforming the agency submitted late Monday.Listing out the problems - which seemed primarily focused on China - it argued that trade imbalances were created as countries offered subsidies, suppressed wages, indulged in labour and environmental abuse and used their currency policies, resulting in massive trade deficit in the US, which it is seeking to address. Besides, it said that non-market policies have resulted in over-capacity and over-concentration of production in some countries.It added that WTO has ""no competence on security matters, including economic security"" or addressing supply chain resilience.The US attacked the basic principle of most-favoured nation (MFN) treatment, providing for countries to levy the same level of tariff for a product. ""The MFN principle is not just unsuitable for this era; it prevents countries from optimising their trade relationships in ways that would benefit each party in that relationship. Put differently, MFN impedes welfare-enhancing liberalisation. It pushes members to engage in one venue - WTO - and attempt to develop a one-size-fits-all approach. ""Arguing that the current global system is completely at variance with what was perceived, the paper said: ""It has been replaced by an era of deepening divergence, rooted in some countries' unwillingness to pursue and uphold fair, market-oriented competition, some countries' insistence on maintaining economic systems that that are fundamentally incompatible with WTO principles, and many countries' pursuit of chronic trade surpluses that have adverse economic and political consequences in deficit countries. To face these challenges, trading nations must be able to treat different trading partners differently.""In what was seen as another comment primarily aimed at China, it said that the current architecture has reduced the manufacturing capabilities of not just the US but other developed and developing countries and called for a deep-rooted reform of WTO. Without naming it India it has hit out at countries that are blocking plurilateral agreements - where a group of WTO member nations come together to do sectoral deals - such as those related to investment facilitation.Further, it said that the special and differential treatment, which allows poor and developing countries such as India a longer implementation period and take lower levels of commitments has once again faced American attack, which has called for its elimination.","The US has serious concerns with the trading system embodied by the WTO.

Easing car emission rules 'pragmatic' response to industry challenges: EU VP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/easing-car-emission-rules-pragmatic-response-to-industry-challenges-eu-vp/articleshow/126012982.cms,"STRASBOURG: Relaxing car emission targets is a ""pragmatic"" answer to the sector's challenges but the EU's green ambitions remain intact, the bloc's industry chief said Tuesday as Brussels walked back a 2035 combustion-engine ban.""The European Commission has chosen an approach that is both pragmatic and consistent with its climate objectives and ambitions,"" Stephane Sejourne told AFP in an interview at the EU parliament.Heeding calls from industry, the European Commission agreed to give ground on one of its flagship climate measures by relaxing the planned ban on new combustion-engine car sales.Instead of a full switch to electric vehicles , Brussels will let carmakers use ""other types of technologies"" for a limited part of their sales beyond 2035, Sejourne said.Adopted under commission chief Ursula von der Leyen's first term, the combustion-engine ban was a key part of the EU's pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.""The goal remains the same,"" said the commission vice president. ""But the flexibilities are pragmatic given consumer uptake and the difficulty for manufacturers to offer 100 percent electric by 2035.""Faced with competition from China and trade tensions with the United States, the EU has delayed or pared back a series of green measures in a pro-business shift over the past year.Sejourne back in March warned that Europe's car industry was in ""mortal danger"" as the EU launched a rescue plan for the sector, with rivals speeding ahead in the United States and China.The jewel in Europe's industrial crown, the auto industry employs almost 14 million people and contributes some seven percent to the European Union's economy -- but faces rising threats.Sejourne rejected the charge from environmentalists that the concessions granted to automakers undermine Europe's climate goals.""The electric transition remains the objective, but these flexibilities are pragmatic in the current context,"" he told AFP in Tuesday's interview.Germany and Poland had pushed hard for a rollback of the 2035 ban and the right to keep selling combustion engine cars beyond 2035.France was more cautious, fearing the move could stifle Europe's emerging electric battery sector.Sejourne stressed that France had not lost out, noting the 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in interest-free loans to European battery makers announced as part of the commission's new measures.","European Commission agrees to give ground on one of its flagship climate measures.

H-1B Showdown: Amazon, Google Microsoft Pour Billions Into India as 20 States Sue Trump

US saw a significant cutdown in jobs in November, marking a record unemployment high since 2021. It gained 64,000 jobs in November, over October's loss of 105,000 positions, primarily due to federal workforce reductions under the Trump administration. The unemployment level increased to 4.6%, reaching its peak since 2021.The Labour Department's delayed reports, released on Tuesday, were postponed by the 43-day federal government closure. November's employment growth exceeded economists' predictions of 40,000, while October's decline stemmed from 162,000 federal workers departing by fiscal year 2025's end on September 30, influenced by Elon Musk 's reduction of government personnel.Official revisions reduced August and September employment figures by 33,000 positions. Employment growth has slowed, affected by uncertainty regarding President Trump's tariff policies and the lingering impact of Federal Reserve's elevated interest rates from 2022-2023 to control inflation.While organisations maintain current staff, they hesitate to expand, grappling with artificial intelligence integration and adaptation to Trump's unpredictable policies, particularly his substantial import tariffs.This situation complicates job searches, while Federal Reserve officials debate interest rate adjustments amidst delayed economic data following the shutdown.The unemployment rate, though historically moderate, has risen since its 54-year low of 3.4% in April 2023. The situation is further complicated by advancing technology potentially reducing workforce requirements.""We've seen a lot of the businesses that we support are stuck in that stagnant mode: 'Are we going to hire or are we not? What can we automate? What do we need the human touch with?''' said Matt Hobbie, vice president of the staffing firm HealthSkil in Allentown, Pennsylvania, as quoted by Associated Press.""We're in Lehigh Valley, which is a big transportation hub in eastern Pennsylvania. We've seen some cooling in the logistics and transportation markets, specifically because we've seen automation in those sectors, robotics,"" he added.Employment concerns prompted the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points, marking the third reduction this year. Three Fed officials opposed this decision, marking the highest dissent in six years. Some officials resist further cuts while inflation exceeds the 2% target. Two maintained their position for unchanged rates, while Trump appointee Stephen Miran supported a larger reduction.The shutdown delayed the Labour Department's September, October and November reports. The September report emerged on November 20, with partial October data released alongside November's report on Tuesday. October's unemployment rate remained uncalculated due to the shutdown.","US saw a significant cutdown in jobs in November, marking a record unemployment high since 2021.

China's Economic Crisis: Record Exports but Plummeting Domestic Growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-1-trillion-trade-surplus-xi-jinping-chinas-economic-model-chinas-property-crisis/articleshow/126007300.cms,"Driving the news

'No Free Lift For India': PM Modi's Chief Economic Adviser Says China Won’t Repeat West’s Mistake

Why it matters

The big picture: A lopsided economy

Indeed, China’s surplus is more a problem for itself than for the rest of the world. It is the only big country where inflation looks dangerously low. Hiring is weak, consumers lack confidence, and the property market has entered the fifth year of a seemingly intractable slump. The central bank is worried that lower interest rates will hurt banks’ margins. And the government is reluctant to do whatever it takes to turn things round. An article in the Economist

Zoom in: The property crisis is the epicenter

Between the lines:

Xi Jinping

is worried about fake growth

“All plans must be based on facts,” Xi said. “Those who act recklessly without regard for reality must be held strictly accountable.”

Growing trade headwinds

French President Emmanuel Macron warned of tariffs and called China’s trade practices “unsustainable.”

Mexico approved new tariffs of up to 50% on Chinese imports starting next year to protect local manufacturers.

US and European leaders continue to pressure China over industrial overcapacity and export dumping, particularly in clean energy and EVs.

The outlook: More of the same - for now

The People’s Bank of China is expected to cut interest rates moderately in early 2026.

The government may repeat a 4% budget deficit, per economists cited by Bloomberg.

Leaders pledged a “proactive fiscal policy,” but specifics are scarce.

China has become dependent on the spending of foreigners to stabilise its own economy. It is not being anti-social. But it is being unwise. The Economist

The bottom line

(With inputs from the agencies)

China's economic engine sputtered hard in November, with retail sales rising just 1.3% - the weakest since December 2022, when “zero-Covid” ended - and industrial production slowing to 4.8%, a 15-month low.Meanwhile, fixed-asset investment dropped 2.6%, the worst performance in decades, and property investment plunged nearly 16%. Even the usually robust auto and appliance markets collapsed, with car sales down 8.5% and home appliance sales falling a staggering 19%, per Bloomberg.“The economy faced a number of challenges,” China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. “There were many external instabilities and uncertainties, and domestic demand was insufficient.”Beijing has been over-reliant on exports to meet its annual growth target of around 5%. That worked in 2025, helping China notch a record $1 trillion trade surplus, but the strategy is showing serious cracks:* Domestic demand is faltering under the weight of a real estate crisis, weak consumer confidence, and fading fiscal stimulus.* Global frustration is rising over China’s massive export surplus.* Protectionist responses are escalating - from the US and Europe to Mexico.“Strong exports limited the need to turbocharge domestic demand this year,” said Xu Tianchen of the Economist Intelligence Unit. “Policymakers have turned their attention to 2026, since the 5% growth target seems within reach.”But the warning signs are piling up that next year could be far tougher.The imbalance between booming exports and collapsing consumption is becoming untenable:* Retail sales growth has now slowed for six consecutive months, the longest streak since 2020, according to the Wall Street Journal.* Despite $1 trillion in exports, China’s domestic economy is stuck in low-gear recovery, with consumer sentiment still shaken by years of lockdowns and a deteriorating property market.* Singles’ Day, China’s Black Friday, ran for five weeks this year. Even that failed to excite cautious spenders.“November data point to broad-based weakness in domestic activity,” said Zichun Huang of Capital Economics. “Policy support should help drive a partial recovery… but this probably won’t prevent China’s growth from remaining weak across 2026.”Bloomberg noted that November’s 1.3% retail sales growth missed every estimate in its analyst survey.At the center of China’s consumption problem sits its property market, which for decades doubled as both a growth engine and a savings account. Roughly 70% of household wealth is tied up in real estate, according to estimates cited by the International Monetary Fund.That wealth is still shrinking.New home prices fell further in November, and property investment dropped 15.9% in the first eleven months of the year, widening from earlier declines. Fixed-asset investment overall fell 2.6% over the same period, one of the sharpest pullbacks on record, according to official data cited by Reuters, Bloomberg, and the Wall Street Journal.The trouble is no longer confined to weaker developers. China Vanke, long seen as relatively stable and backed by state-linked lenders, plans to hold another bondholder meeting this week after investors rejected a proposal to delay repayment on an onshore bond. The company is now racing against the clock during the bond’s grace period, according to Reuters.“Developers are struggling to convince investors there are buyers for their apartments,” said Fu Linghui, NBS spokesperson. “Even discounted units remain unsold.”The IMF has warned that repairing the sector could cost the equivalent of 5% of GDP over the next three years. But even that figure understates the psychological damage. Unsold apartments, discounted units, and half-finished developments have turned housing from a source of security into a reminder of risk.At last week’s Central Economic Work Conference, President Xi Jinping issued a rare rebuke of GDP-chasing and inflated local data, warning that “reckless” projects and overbuilt industrial zones are wasting resources and distorting progress, a Bloomberg report said.His call for “high-quality, sustainable development” was widely seen as a rebuke of the decades-long model that emphasized GDP at any cost - often backed by wasteful borrowing and inflated statistics.Yet the contradiction is stark:* Xi demands quality growth,* But local officials remain judged on quantity,* While global demand for Chinese goods is starting to fade under rising tariffs.While exports saved China’s 2025 performance, protectionism is spreading fast - and the backlash is now global, not just from Washington.“China is too large to rely on exports for growth,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned last week.Despite warnings, no aggressive new stimulus appears imminent.China’s 30-year bond futures have slumped to their lowest levels since 2024, and stock markets remain under pressure. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index is down 1.3% amid renewed real estate fears.Still, the 5% growth target for 2026 - seen as politically important - remains in place, likely buoyed by modest stimulus and base effects.For now, China is still likely to hit its growth target of around 5% this year. Most economists expect Beijing to set a similar target for 2026, along with a fiscal stimulus package roughly the same size as this year’s.But confidence in the medium-term outlook is fading.“November data point to a broad-based weakness in domestic activity, largely due to a pull-back in fiscal spending,” said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. “Policy support should help drive a partial recovery in the coming months, but this probably won’t avert China’s growth from remaining weak across 2026 as a whole.”Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, was more blunt in comments cited by Bloomberg. “While a 5% real growth target is likely a done deal, 2026 will be a much more challenging year if the stress persists,” he said.China’s economy is not collapsing. It is stalling in a more subtle, more politically uncomfortable way. The factories still run. The ships still leave port. But inside the country, households remain cautious, investors hesitant, and policymakers caught between old instincts and new constraints.","China's economic engine sputtered hard in November, with retail sales rising just 1.3% and industrial production slowing to 4.8%.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

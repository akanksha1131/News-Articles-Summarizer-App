Flipkart IPO : Flipkart, currently valued at $36 billion and recognised as India's premier ecommerce company, has set its sights on going public. The organisation is establishing a clear schedule of 12-15 months for its initial public offering (IPO), according to several individuals familiar with the plans. This forthcoming share issue, anticipated to be the largest by a new-economy company, represents a significant milestone for India's startup ecosystem, now ranked third globally.The company, under Walmart's ownership, has received internal clearance to shift its registration from Singapore to India, which is considered essential for the IPO process. Sources informed ET that the company aims to launch its public offering either by the end of next year or within 2026's first quarter.Flipkart IPO is likely to be the first among a group of approximately twelve new-age companies planning to enter the stock market in 2025. This follows the successful market entries of various consumer internet businesses, including Zomato, Nykaa and Swiggy, which have generated substantial interest among retail investors in Indian startups.The ecommerce leader has successfully secured nearly $1 billion in funding this year, with Google contributing $350 million. Although IPO discussions began in late 2021, they were temporarily suspended due to unfavourable market conditions during 2022-23.At Flipkart, under the leadership of group CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy, the priority remains enhancing profitability whilst maintaining growth rates marginally above the industry standard.Walmart's October quarter earnings report highlighted Flipkart's impressive performance, noting double-digit growth during its signature Big Billion Days sale , which positively impacted Walmart's global revenue.Industry analysts have calculated that Indian ecommerce achieved Rs 1 lakh crore in gross sales during the festive period this year, with Flipkart retaining its market leadership position during this crucial season.Established in 2007 as an online bookstore, Flipkart's parent company is based in Singapore. This was a common practice among prominent startups of that era, who established holding companies overseas due to favourable funding conditions and regulatory frameworks.PhonePe, previously Singapore-based, relocated its domicile to India, resulting in $1 billion in tax benefits for the Indian government. Any potential merger between entities in India and Singapore would trigger tax implications. PhonePe completed its separation from Flipkart in late 2022, subsequently securing external funding from investors, including its primary stakeholder, Walmart.","Flipkart IPO is likely to be the first among a group of approximately twelve new-age companies planning to enter the stock market in 2025.

Malhotra will succeed Shakikanta Das whose tenure is scheduled to end on December 10, 2024. Sanjay Malhotra will be the 26th governor of India's central bank.Malhotra will start his three-year tenure as RBI governor from December 11. He will take over from Shaktikanta Das , who has led the central bank since 2018. In the past Malhotra has served as a representative of the financial services department on the RBI board.Sanjay Malhotra, a 1990 batch Indian Administrative Service Officer from the Rajasthan Cadre, holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from IIT Kanpur and earned his Master's in Public Policy from Princeton University, USA.Throughout his career spanning more than 33 years, Sanjay Malhotra has served across diverse sectors, including power, finance, taxation, information technology, and mines. Currently serving as secretary (revenue) in the ministry of finance, he previously held the position of secretary in the department of financial services under the ministry of finance, Government of India.His extensive expertise encompasses finance and taxation at both state and central government levels. As a revenue secretary, he significantly contributes to formulating tax policies concerning both direct and indirect taxation systems, according to the department of revenue website.According to a Bloomberg report, Malhotra’s strong working relationship with the finance minister is expected to enhance the synchronisation of monetary and fiscal policies. During his ministry tenure, the successful rollout of the new income tax system stands as a notable accomplishment.Although Malhotra has maintained silence on monetary policy matters, he has advocated for investment growth through tax system simplification.

The RBI faces mounting pressure to reduce interest rates, particularly as GDP growth declined to 5.4% in the July-September quarter, marking a seven-quarter low.Senior government officials from the Narendra Modi government have increasingly advocated for RBI easing. Both finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and trade minister Piyush Goyal have recently expressed concerns about the economic impact of high borrowing costs.In his final policy decision on Friday, Shaktikanta Das maintained the benchmark rate whilst implementing measures to enhance banking system liquidity, potentially supporting the decelerating economy.Das indicated that food price fluctuations, comprising approximately half of the inflation basket, would likely keep price increases elevated during October to December.CPI inflation continues to exceed the RBI's target, reaching a 14-month peak of 6.21% in October. The central bank operates under a government-mandated inflation target of 4%, with a tolerance band of plus or minus two percentage points.Analysts suggest this surprise appointment will not significantly change India's monetary policy direction.According to a Bloomberg survey, most economists anticipate the central bank will begin reducing rates in early next year.""If growth continues to underwhelm, then obviously chances of interest rate cut increases, but a February rate cut still depends on data,"" said Gaurav Kapur, an economist with IndusInd Bank Ltd.""The RBI has a history of bureaucrats becoming the governor,"" said Anubhuti Sahay, an economist with Standard Chartered Bank Plc.

Several Jewelry Stocks Soared in India This Year

India’s Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. is expecting the country’s insatiable appetite for discretionary goods and the government’s push to expand manufacturing to spur the next leg of a rally in related shares.Chief Investment Officer Niket Shah said he’s adding shares of companies that offer lower priced non-essential goods, such as jewelry and apparel, on expectations of increased spending. He’s also scouting for opportunities in India’s growing electronic component sector. The asset manager’s Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund has returned about 63% in the last 12 months against a 33% gain in its benchmark, making it the top mutual fund in the nation.As food inflation remains high, the government will try to put more money in the hands of the people, said Shah, who oversees more than $7 billion. “I’m expecting meaningful changes to the income tax code that will benefit consumers at large,” he said.While rising prices have hurt demand for fast-moving consumer goods companies, people aren’t willing to dial down on some discretionary spending, said Shah. People earning lower incomes are “aspiring to get high-end phones,” even if that means sacrificing on basic expenses, he said.Spotting sector inflection points and making timely exits have helped the fund’s performance, Shah said. He bought telecom companies Bharti Airtel Ltd., Indus Towers Ltd. and Vodafone Idea Ltd. before the industry implemented fare hikes. Bets on technology stocks Persistent Systems Ltd. and Zomato Ltd. also added to gains.In electronics manufacturing, production-linked incentives will likely boost the sector as the nation seeks to expand its role in global supply chains, according to Shah.“I’m also getting the sense that the government is slowly moving in favor of allowing some Chinese firms to set up joint ventures in India,” he said. “With technology from China and manufacturing done in India, there is a lot more scale that is achievable.”As of Nov. 31, Motilal held Kalyan Jewellers India Ltd. and affordable fashion retailer Trent Ltd. in various portfolios.

'Consumption to go up after inflation eases',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/consumption-to-go-up-after-inflation-eases/articleshow/116269234.cms,"Harsha Vardhan Agarwal

Lower real income seems to have hit consumption. Is the industry feeling the effect of slowdown?

Was the slowdown in the Sept quarter just a blip? Have you seen sales improve during first two months of the quarter?

Will a rate cut help?

There's a lot of commentary around stagnant wages. How much of that is contributing to slowdown?

What would be your suggestion for fixing this consumption slowdown?

What about private investment? Why is the private sector not rising?

Harsha Vardhan Agarwal, vice chairman and managing director of Emami, has taken over as president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci). In an interview, Agarwal tells TOI that it will take one or two quarters more for consumption to be ""normal"" and said the focus should be on moderating inflation as higher prices have dented consumption in urban areas. Excerpt.At a broader level, consumption has been impacted and that's why for many FMCG companies the second quarter results have not been the kind that one is used to, and one of the reasons is consumption. Discretionary spending is where it gets impacted. In India, of the average retail purchase, 75% goes towards food and grocery items and only 25% is for discretionary spend. Any impact of food prices has an adverse impact on discretionary spend. Since there are some challenges in terms of food prices, it has an impact. Coming to my company, it's a mixed bag because in rural areas we are seeing some uptick, premium products are doing well. It's the middle class and the lower middle class that is where the real impact is.The Sept quarter was certainly not great. If you ask me whether in the next one or two quarters we go back to normalcy? I wouldn't say yes. But would you say things are improving? I would say we see the situation gradually improving.That is the balance that RBI is trying to achieve by not cutting interest rates as it may have an impact on inflation. The idea is first to contain inflation because consumption will go up once inflation eases to an acceptable level.I wouldn't say wages are stagnant. May be in terms of inflation, they have not increased as much.The solution is that inflation has to be brought down and right now that's where the govt's focus is. Once that is under control, consumption should come. The second is capital expenditure because in the last quarter govt capex was lower, primarily because of elections. We are very hopeful that in the third and fourth quarters it will go up substantially and that should also help bring back consumption.It would be wrong to say that private investment is not increasing. It may not have increased to the extent that was expected.","Harsha Vardhan Agarwal, vice chairman and managing director of Emami, has taken over as president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) He says it will take one or two quarters more for consumption to be ""normal"" and said the focus should be on moderating inflation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116269279,imgsize-595580,width-400,resizemode-4/116269279.jpg"

Reliance-Rosneft deal has 10-year extension option

NEW DELHI: Mukesh Ambani 's Reliance Industries Ltd has signed a deal to import crude oil worth $12-13 billion a year from Russia's Rosneft for 10 years, sources said. Russian state oil firm Rosneft will supply up to 500,000 barrels per day (25 million tonne a year) of crude oil to Reliance, they said.Reached for comments, a Reliance spokesperson said Russia is currently the largest supplier of crude oil to India.""We are always engaged with a number of international suppliers, including from Russia, for sourcing feedstock for our refinery. As per practice, such supply contracts are done for the following year. The number of cargoes will vary depending on economics given the prevailing market conditions,"" the spokesperson said. The deal comes ahead of President Vladimir Putin's planned visit to India. PTI & ReutersUnder the deal, Rosneft would deliver 20-21 Aframax-sized cargoes (80,000 to 100,000 metric tons) of various Russian crude grades and three cargoes of about 100,000 tons each of fuel oil each month, the three sources said.The new deal accounts for roughly a half of Rosneft's seaborne oil exports from Russian ports, which leaves not much supply available for other traders and middlemen, one source said.From Jan to Oct, Reliance imported an average 405,000 barrels per day of Russian oil, up from 388,500 bpd in the same period last year, according to tanker data obtained from sources. The new deal between Rosneft and Reliance was discussed and approved during Rosneft's board meeting in Nov, two of the sources said.Supplies will start from Jan and are set to continue for 10 years with an option to extend the deal for another 10 years, the three sources said.

LAS VEGAS: Amazon's cloud unit AWS unveiled new AI models and chips to take on rivals like Microsoft, which has had an edge due to its ties with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.Exactly two years ago, the launch of ChatGPT thrust Silicon Valley into the AI age, forcing tech giants to redraw plans and wiping out billions from market caps of companies that were slow to adapt. AWS, which pioneered renting out data infrastructure, was seen to be losing grip on its cloud dominance over the past two years amid the AI boom.However, Andy Jassy, who built AWS before succeeding Jeff Bezos as Amazon CEO in 2021, sees it differently. ""When we talk about AI, it is typically less to announce that we have beat the best chess player in the world... We are not using AI because we think it is cool. We are using it because we are trying to solve customer problems,"" Jassy said at AWS's annual tech event re:Invent in Las Vegas last week. AWS has sought to embed AI into its services and push customers to bring more of their applications by offering them a wide choice of AI models and chips, including its in-house ones, through its Bedrock platform.""With the announcement of Nova, we have made it clear that we want to compete... Whether it's chips or models, we will be very competitive on costs,"" Sherry Marcus, director of applied science (GenAI) at AWS, told TOI. Nova, which launched last week, is AWS's answer to AI foundation models like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4o. Essentially, these are machine learning models trained on vast datasets and designed to produce a range of outputs, including chatbots.AI-related capabilities dominated AWS's announcements at the cloud conference.

Bleak urban demand to weigh on FMCG in '25,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bleak-urban-demand-to-weigh-on-fmcg-in-25/articleshow/116268795.cms,"Bleak urban demand to weigh on FMCG in '25

MUMBAI: The coming year is looking tough for India's consumer goods companies .The urban middle class - key to driving sales volumes for mass brands - is not spending enough and rising commodity inflation means that firms may find it difficult to curb further price hikes, hurting consumption even more. While rural demand seems buoyant, it alone cannot compensate for slowing urban consumption unless some policy measures are introduced to incentivise the middle class to spend, analysts said.Macroeconomic factors have been weighing on the middle class. A lack of enough employment opportunities in urban regions seems to have created some pressure on the segment, Soumya Mohanty, MD and chief client officer (insights division, South Asia) at Kantar, told TOI. ""There has been a K-shaped recovery (post-Covid). The top (income segment) has expanded much faster. The middle is where the squeeze is happening. A lot of them are also tax-paying. Unless inflation eases or there are some policy/tax incentives in place, it will be difficult for mass consumption to improve,"" he said.It is the lower middle class that has borne the brunt of challenging macroeconomic conditions. Kantar describes this consumer cohort as those engaged in high grade blue collar jobs or low grade white collar jobs, with most households owning a motorcycle or other two wheelers.Flowing with a rising market, the FMCG index too scaled a new high in Sept-end this year, despite signs of an incoming slow growth phase. Since then, as the numbers showed these companies were facing headwinds, the index too lost about 14%. Currently, at 20,812 points, the BSE's FMCG index is almost at the same level as where it started the year.""The current inflationary environment has created pressure on margins... we anticipate a temporary downward breach of the normative margins this quarter,"" Godrej Consumer Products said, adding that the negative trends are likely to persist for a few months. Dabur said that continued inflation and macroeconomic headwinds might pose some challenges in the coming year. ""...we will take action through a combination of price hikes, increased premiumisation and accelerated cost-saving initiatives to mitigate the impact of input cost pressures,"" said CFO Ankush Jain.Indicators such as reduced savings rates and increased debt levels - especially through credit cards and EMIs - reflect constrained disposable incomes, Mayank Shah, vice president at Parle Products, said. ""This trend aligns with higher purchases of durables and automobiles on credit over the past two quarters, which contributed to robust sales in these categories. The higher reliance on credit and the resulting debt burden have impacted urban spending on FMCG products,"" he said. The company doesn't see revival of urban demand to set in at least before the June quarter of next year.While companies have been focusing on premiumisation to drive growth, analysts said that there might be some slowdown in the premium segment as well going ahead. This is expected as consumers may shift some of their spends to experiences besides experimenting with new D2C brands in the market.","The urban middle class is key to driving sales volumes for mass brands.

Retail inflation eases to 5.5% in Nov as food prices soften,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/retail-inflation-eases-to-5-5-in-nov-as-food-prices-soften/articleshow/116268586.cms,"RBI

Back in RBI's tolerance band

NEW DELHI: Retail inflation eased in November from a 14-month high in the previous month on the back of moderating food prices , while industrial output growth displayed a modest upturn in October.Data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Thursday showed inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 5.5% in November, slower than the 6.2% in Oct and almost at the same level of 5.6% in Nov last year. The sharp spike in October had dashed hopes of any rate cut and prompted RBI to hold rates for the 11th consecutive time earlier this month.The consumer food price index rose 9% during the month, slower than the 10.9% in Oct. Rural inflation continued to remain higher than urban in Nov at around 6%, while urban was at 4.8%.While there was some softening in food prices, it still remained high at 9%. Vegetable prices rose 29.3% during the month, while edible oil inflation touched a 30-month high of 13.3% and experts said vegetables and edible oil prices need careful monitoring.The easing of price pressures in Nov has triggered hopes of a rate cut in Feb. ""Overall, we expect inflation to soften in the coming months led by food inflation; however, rigidity in vegetable and edible oil prices keep the upside pressure high. In our base case, we expect inflation to average 4.6% this fiscal with some upside bias to the forecast and expect a policy rate cut in Feb,"" said Dipti Deshpande, principal economist at ratings agency Crisil.Separate data released by the NSO showed industrial output rose an annual 3.5% in Oct, marginally higher than the 3.1% in the previous month but lower than the 11.9% in Oct last year. Manufacturing sector rose 4.1% in Oct from 3.9% in the previous month.Experts said that a sustained and broad-based improvement in consumption will be essential to support industrial activity in the coming months.""Rural demand has been showing signs of improvement. Favourable conditions for rabi sowing, including healthy reservoir levels and improved soil moisture from extended monsoons, are likely to aid agricultural production,"" ratings agency CareEdge said in a note.""This is expected to support the moderation in food inflation by the end of FY25, providing a boost to consumption. However, we need to remain watchful of trends in urban demand, especially considering some signs of slowdown. With external demand remaining pressured, recovery in domestic consumption and investment remains crucial for the performance of industrial activity,"" the note added.","Retail inflation eased in November from a 14-month high in the previous month.

The Nasdaq Composite Index achieved a historic milestone on Wednesday, reaching 20,000 for the first time, driven by enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence and anticipated interest rate reductions that propelled technology stocks to remarkable heights.The technology-focused index has risen over 33% this year, led by major tech firms including Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and recently Tesla. The gains on Wednesday followed a US inflation report that strengthened expectations for a Federal Reserve rate reduction next week.The index concluded Wednesday's trading at 20,034.89, representing a 1.8% daily increase.The current rally has benefited investors focused on growth and technology sectors, whilst raising concerns about elevated valuations and the increasing influence of large-capitalisation stocks within the index.""There is clearly an aspect of a chase into year-end, where the winners ... keep winning,"" stated Cameron Dawson, chief investment officer at NewEdge Wealth. ""The question is if this momentum can persist into 2025, where stretched valuations, positioning, sentiment, and growth expectations could all present high bars to jump over to keep above-average returns going.""Following its early 2020 decline during the pandemic-induced economic standstill, the index recovered swiftly as the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates to near-zero and the US government implemented substantial fiscal stimulus measures.The index experienced a significant decline in 2022, dropping 33% amidst 40-year high inflation rates and aggressive Federal Reserve rate increases. However, despite higher rates, the anticipated recession did not materialise, and the index has surged approximately 90% since then, partly due to growing enthusiasm about AI's commercial potential.Nvidia shares , whose chips are regarded as industry-leading, have increased more than 1,100% from their October 2022 low.""The AI story still rings true and appeals to investors,"" noted Alex Morris, chief investment officer of F/m Investments. ""These are the go-go stocks.""Despite the Nasdaq's increased valuation, it remains significantly below levels seen during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.The index currently trades at approximately 36 times earnings, a three-year peak exceeding its long-term average of 27, according to LSEG Datastream. This remains well below the roughly 70 times P/E ratio reached in March 2000, providing some reassurance to investors comparing the two periods.Large-capitalisation stocks increasingly dominate the index, with the top 10 companies representing 59% of the Nasdaq, compared to 45% in 2020.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File)

US consumer prices continued to rise in November at a pace that is fueling concerns the progress toward taming inflation is stalling.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — increased 0.3% for a fourth straight month, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Wednesday. From a year ago, it rose 3.3%.Traders continued to bet on a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut next week after the figures came in largely as expected.Follow the reaction in real time here on Bloomberg’s TOPLive blogEconomists see the core gauge as a better indicator of the underlying inflation trend than the overall CPI that includes often-volatile food and energy costs. The headline measure rose 0.3% from the prior month and 2.7% from a year before. Shelter costs accounted for nearly 40% of the overall advance.While price pressures have subsided from a peak seen during the pandemic recovery, progress has leveled off more recently. That, along with receding concerns over the labor market, helps explain why several US central bankers have argued for a more gradual pace of interest-rate cuts.The CPI report showed goods costs excluding food and energy climbed 0.3%, the most since May 2023 and fueled by higher prices for new and used vehicles as well as apparel. That category had been a large driver of disinflation over the past year and a half.Grocery prices jumped 0.5%, the biggest advance since the start of last year.Economists have paid close attention to shelter prices, the largest category within services and one of the most persistent sources of inflation in recent years. That metric advanced 0.3% in November after a 0.4% gain in the prior month. Owners’ equivalent rent as well as rent of primary residence — subsets of shelter — both edged up 0.2%, the smallest gains since 2021.Excluding housing and energy, service prices rose 0.3% for a second month, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the overall inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure — known as the personal consumption expenditures price index — doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI, which is one reason why it’s trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target.A government report on producer prices due Thursday will offer insights into categories that feed directly into PCE, including health-care services, airfares and portfolio management.Policymakers also pay close attention to wage growth, as it can help inform expectations for consumer spending — the main engine of the economy. A separate report Wednesday that combines the inflation figures with recent wage data showed real hourly earnings grew 1.3% from a year ago.Part of the reason why Fed officials have indicated they’re in no rush to lower borrowing costs is because they no longer believe the labor market to be a source of inflation.Looking ahead, it remains to be seen to what extent President-elect Donald Trump ’s agenda will weigh on the trajectory of inflation. While consumers’ views of the economy and their finances have improved since he sealed his return to the White House, many economists say some of his campaign promises could put additional pressure on inflation. Some businesses, for example, are considering raising prices in anticipation of higher tariffs.","Core consumer price index increased 0.3% for a fourth straight month. From a year ago, it rose 3.3%.

Is Nissan's decline inevitable? Honda merger talks could hold key to survival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/is-nissans-decline-inevitable-honda-merger-talks-could-hold-key-to-survival/articleshow/116148355.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Is a Honda merger the answer?

Nissan is grappling with a severe financial crisis that could lead to bankruptcy within the next 12 to 14 months unless decisive action is taken. The company, once a leader in the automotive industry, is now in its worst position since Carlos Ghosn's dramatic efforts in 1999 to pull it from the brink of collapse.With profits plunging by 70 per cent and a recent $60 million loss, Nissan is scrambling to find a solution to its mounting troubles, reported Forbes.In an attempt to salvage its future, Nissan has outlined a major restructuring plan, targeting $3 billion in savings.This includes slashing 9,000 jobs globally and selling a significant portion of its stake in Mitsubishi Motors . The company is also cutting production by 20 per cent at key US facilities in Canton, Mississippi, and Smyrna, Tennessee, which together employ over 13,000 workers.In a rare move, CEO Makoto Uchida has taken a 50 per cent pay cut to signal the urgency of the situation.Nissan’s woes can largely be attributed to its struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing automotive landscape.The company’s electric vehicle lineup is minimal, with only two models available internationally, while cheaper Chinese EV alternatives are flooding the market. Despite these challenges, there are bright spots.In the US, the locally-built Rogue SUV remains a top performer, having sold over 189,000 units through September 2024. Similarly, the Qashqai continues to dominate in Europe.However, these successes are not enough to counteract the broader decline, as per Forbes.Nissan is now searching for a lifeline, and a potential merger with Honda could be the key to its survival. The two companies recently signed a partnership focused on electric vehicle development , and some industry experts are speculating that a merger could help combine resources to overcome current financial struggles.According to the Financial Times, while this idea remains speculative, it could provide Nissan with the strength it needs to compete in the increasingly competitive global automotive market.Reacting to the report, Nissan Motor India spokesperson said, “As a policy we do not comment on speculatory reports. Nissan remains committed to its India operations, dealers, partners, and customers. We remain on track for our plan announced earlier this year at the launches of the Nissan X-TRAIL and New Nissan Magnite.”Nissan’s future remains uncertain, and time is running out. The company must make bold decisions, such as finding a major investor or merging with Honda if it hopes to avoid the fate of bankruptcy.","Nissan has outlined a major restructuring plan, targeting $3 billion in savings.

Saudi Arabia is cutting oil prices for buyers in Asia by more than expected after OPEC+ further delayed an output revival, underscoring how the outlook for the market remains weak.State oil producer Saudi Aramco will sell its main Arab Light crude grade at a premium of 90 cents a barrel to the regional benchmark in Jan, according to a price list seen by Bloomberg.

TSMC rules

Trump tariffs

As South Korea descends into political chaos, its equity market risks falling further behind major tech rival Taiwan, which is basking in the glory of the global artificial intelligence boom.A near 30% surge in Taiwan’s stock benchmark this year, set to be the best since 2009, has already helped spur a historic divergence between Asia’s two tech-dominated markets. The island’s market capitalization now exceeds South Korea’s by about $950 billion as the world’s AI frontrunners from Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to OpenAI all increasingly turn to Taiwanese firms for supply.Looking ahead to next year, while both export-oriented economies face the risk of higher tariffs by incoming US President Donald Trump, many investors see Taiwan as less vulnerable given the reliance of American firms on its technology as well as its relatively better economic prospects.Such optimism, and a recent pickup in inflows into local stocks, also augur well for the Taiwanese dollar, which has fared better than the Korean won in 2024.“The structural theme of AI is likely to only get extended further, and this means we could see another year of Taiwan outperformance,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore. “The Korea discount may linger for longer given the recent political debacle, and the corporate governance reforms will have to be prioritized to get any closer to erasing this discount.”South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is fighting for his political life after his attempt to break an impasse in parliament by briefly imposing martial law backfired. The turmoil has cast a pall over the nation’s outlook and it also may impact the Corporate Value-Up program much touted by Yoon as a way to boost shareholder returns and eradicate the so-called Korea Discount, a term referring to the long depressed valuations of the country’s equities.Down more than 8% this year, the Kospi is one of the world’s worst-performing major equity indexes. Its underperformance versus Taiwan’s Taiex has deepened further this month.Taiwan’s equity-market outperformance has a lot to do with this year’s 80% surge in the shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s top advanced chipmaker that accounts for 37% of the benchmark’s weighting. The company is the major supplier of Nvidia and Apple Inc.’s most advanced chips.In contrast, shares of Samsung Electronics Co. — South Korea’s most-valued company — have been the biggest drag on its local market. Samsung’s stock has slumped 31% in Seoul this year on concerns that the firm is missing out on the AI boom due to slow progress on technological breakthroughs and lingering management woes.Overall, Taiwan’s exposure to AI goes far beyond TSMC: over 40 AI-related firms constitute about 73% of MSCI Taiwan’s index weighting, according to Goldman Sachs Group analysts. At 33%, Korea is a distant second in Asia and features SK Hynix Inc. and Samsung Electronics only.Analysts’ average earnings per share estimate for MSCI Taiwan has risen more than 33% this year to a record high, while that for MSCI Korea has declined 5% since a peak in August, Bloomberg compiled data shows.“If you think of Nvidia’s AI server market and so on, Taiwan is heavily involved in that value chain,” said Yan Taw Boon, portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. “Conversely, Korea has not performed as strongly as they have very little involvement in this new booming environment.”While the higher tariffs threatened by Trump are a universal challenge, there are reasons some investors believe that Taiwan’s treatment may be more nuanced and less punishing.“One will recall that many Taiwanese exports were exempt from tariffs last time around as they were key components of US tech supply chains,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Rajiv Batra wrote in a note. “This time is likely to be the same with TSMC seen as a major part of the Global AI trade.”The Wall Street bank sees Taiwan relatively better positioned than Korea in a trade war with the US.Another buffer for Taiwanese equities is the growing presence of local investors, especially when the global investment climate turns more capricious.“Taiwan retail investors’ home bias and the still interesting AI ramp-up theme should continue to drive participation in the stock market,” said Vivian Pai, fund manager at Fidelity International. Their increased awareness of long-term investing can help form strong consistent inflows into local stocks, she added.The Taiwan dollar has weakened about 5% against the US currency this year while the Korean won has fallen around 9%.“Both Taiwan and Korea are exposed to tariffs but Taiwan’s underlying economic fundamentals are more solid,” said Eddie Cheung, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “This should persist in 2025.”",Taiwan's market capitalization now exceeds South Korea's by about $950 billion.

Rexas Finance (RXS): The future of real-world asset tokenisation?

Tokenising real-world assets: A $379.7 trillion opportunity

Why Rexas Finance could hit $2.5

There’s no doubt that cryptocurrencies remain highly volatile assets. Investors seek high-yield projects, and while Ripple leads in cross-border blockchain transactions, a new contender is emerging. Rexas Finance (RXS) has a big vision of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation. By integrating traditional assets with blockchain technology, Rexas Finance creates opportunities for investors to penetrate high-value markets that have been hard to navigate, such as real estate and art. This analysis reviews the possibility of RXS replicating Ripple’s steps to the $2.5 mark and whether it would attract investors during the process.Ripple's popularity stems from its fast, low-cost global payment platform. Currently priced at $2.33, XRP boasts a market capitalisation of $133.6 billion, reflecting strong investor confidence. The coin is still dominant despite its prominent issues with SEC accusations of the company. RippleNet, the company's payment network, gained the confidence of many banks and financial institutions. This reinforces expectations for the future of XRP quite a lot. The investors’ mood is quite optimistic as many think of a positive outcome of the ongoing SEC case, which is likely to create new highs for XRP. Some analysts predict that the price might rise to around $3 only in the short term, while $5 is possible but only if Ripple can penetrate many institutional on-boards and acquire new customers throughout the industry. XRP provides steady growth, but other newer projects, such as Rexas Finance (RXS), which is focused on real-world asset tokenisation and other latest trends within the blockchain industry, are perceived to present opportunities for higher exponential returns.Unlike Ripple, Rexas Finance is focused on revolutionising the investment landscape by bridging conventional assets with blockchain technology. The project enables fractional ownership of high-value assets like real estate, gold, and art, broadening access for more investors. The presale has raised $21 million, selling 292 million RXS tokens out of a total supply of 1 billion. The current Stage 9 presale price of $0.125 marks a significant increase from the initial $0.030 price, reflecting a 320% surge. The next presale stage will sell for $0.15, with substantial growth potential after that. Rexas Finance’s decision to bypass venture capital funding and adopt a community-driven presale model has been a strategic success. This inclusive approach aligns with blockchain’s decentraliz\sation principles, fostering trust and loyalty among early investors.Rexas Finance’s selling point hits the point, showing how they can gain access to huge markets through tokenisation. The real estate industry is said to have a market worth around $379.7 trillion; when it comes to gold or other commodities, the entire segment is valued at $121.2 trillion. There is also room for expansion in the $65 billion annual revenue art market. Rexas Finance unlocks investment opportunities in high-value assets by tokenizing them, making it possible for people to invest in expensive properties and commodities without the usual constraints of high capital requirements. Users of Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad, among other of the platform’s tools, can develop their own tokenised assets and invest in fractionalized shares of luxury objects. This advancement makes it easier for people to hold assets while increasing security, transparency, and reach to users worldwide.Rexas Finance's presale performance, coupled with innovation in the business model, is why it can reach the $2.5 mark after launch. Since the token price is $0.125, this is a win-win situation for early investors who hope to get better rates before the token gets primary exchange listings in early 2025. Another factor that allowed the platform to attract a more extensive investor base is its listing on the CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko platforms. In addition, the $1 million giveaway, promising 20 prizes of 50,000 RXS tokens, generated a lot of buzz and engagement. Hitting the $2.5 target is not just wishful thinking. The combination of Rexas Finance’s existing and future focus on tokenizing global real-world assets and the community-building element will ensure explosive growth. As more and more people use Rexas Finance, and if the platform's innovation trend continues, the $2.5 mark is very much attainable.The price of Ripple (XRP) remains fairly stable for investing purposes, with its offerings revolving around the payments and remittance sector. For investors who want to take on a higher risk and expect better returns, there is Rexas Finance (RXS), which appears worth looking into. The token aims to leverage the growing market of tokenized real-world assets at a community level. It has been focused heavily on its pre-sale activities, giving it much room for growth. Rexas Finance is an exciting investment. It is currently priced at $0.125, but estimates project it to reach $2.5 post-launch. For those wishing to take advantage of the potential within blockchain technology these days, Rexas Finance cannot be overlooked.For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:Website: https://rexas.com Whitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf Twitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance Telegram: https://t.me/rexasfinance","Rexas Finance (RXS) has a big vision of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation.

"Bitcoin tops $100,000 as Trump fuels crypto rally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bitcoin-tops-100000-as-trump-fuels-crypto-rally/articleshow/116025906.cms,"Bitcoin

President-elect Donald Trump’s pick of a crypto proponent to be the next head of the US securities regulator lifted Bitcoin to $100,000 for the first time as traders warmed to the prospect of relaxed regulations.The digital asset rose as much as 6.1% to $103,801 on Thursday before changing hands at $101,968 as of 6:45 am in London. The crypto market overall has jumped by roughly $1.3 trillion since Trump’s election victory on Nov 5 on a platform that includes a tight embrace of the crypto sector.Trump selected Paul Atkins to replace outgoing Securities & Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, who cracked down on digital assets after a 2022 market rout exposed fraudulent practices and sparked costly blowups.“This is a momentum rally,” said Jason Titman, CEO, crypto brokerage Swyftx. “Global spot volumes are above mid-pandemic levels and nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC chair just added to the carnival atmosphere.”On November 22, Bitcoin was less than $300 from achie ving $100,000 but fell back while remaining in sight of the landmark level. Crypto’s adherents view the six-figure number as a validation of controversial claims that Bitcoin is a modern-day store of value and a hedge for inflation risk. For critics, the digital asset lacks any fundamental value and is too exposed to speculative whims.Hitting $100,000 is “a huge milestone for token and crypto industry as a whole,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, a provider of liquidity for crypto derivatives. “We expect further momentum for the coming days.”US exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin have attrac ted a net inflow of about $32 billion this year, including over $8 billion since Trump became president-elect, data compiled by Bloomberg sho wed. The combined trading volume for digital assets and related derivatives across centralised exchanges climbed to a record of more than $10 trillion last month, according to CCData.Trump has vowed to undo a Biden administration clampdown on digital assets, install friendly regulators and turn the US into global home of crypto. The Republican even backed idea of strategic national Bitcoin reserve, though there are doubts over whether the latter objective is feasible.","The digital asset rose as much as 6.1% to $103,801 on Thursday before changing hands at $101,968 as of 6:45 am in London.

But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

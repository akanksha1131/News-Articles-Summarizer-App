Top stock market recommendations:Nifty has hit its initial target of 25050 – 25250 from the point it reversed after closing above 24600. With index closing near to its 4 week highs, tailwind momentum is likely to push it to the next target of 25250 on the upside while dips below 24985 are set to get bought into with support seen at 24850.After dropping over 5% from its recent highs, Bank Nifty has shown some short covering since the start of this week after the gap up opening on Monday. Any closing above 55800 is likely to set the toner for further bullishness on the index while a retest of 55500 – 55550 is likely to act as buy on dip for the index for a 3-4% rally unfolding from current levels.The stock of Godawari Power and Ispat Limited had been trading in a range since last few months and has given a highest close in calendar year 2025 yesterday with very strong volumes. Breakout after such long consolidation often leads to explosive move.A quick 12-15% move can be seen on the stock to reclaim its all time high.The stock of Amara Raja Energy & Mobility Ltd has been forming base since last few months and some initial signs of momentum has started to show up with stock giving positive close with strong volumes.

A close above 800 will lead to rise in momentum for a quick 6-8% move.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Godawari Power and Ispat Limited, Amara Raja Energy & Mobility Ltd, and HDFC Life are the top buy calls for today.

Gold rates have been stabilizing and analysts are eyeing a buy on dips strategy. Here's the analysis from Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today:Gold prices on MCX are currently trading around ₹99,300, showing signs of stabilization after recent declines. The short-term structure on the charts suggests that a Buy on Dips strategy may be favored, especially near the ₹99,000 pivot support zone, with a stop-loss placed at ₹98,600.Technical Setup Overview:1. Pivot Points & Support Zone:• Daily Pivot stands at ₹99,074, with immediate support near ₹99,000.• Stronger support lies at ₹98,743 (S1) and ₹98,182 (S2).• On the higher side, resistance levels are visible at ₹99,970 (R2) and ₹1,00,531 (R3).2. Bollinger Bands – Price Stabilization:Gold recently tested the lower Bollinger band and has now started consolidating near the mid-band. This reflects fading downside pressure, with scope for a bounce if momentum sustains above the pivot levels.3. Momentum Indicators – RSI & MACD:• RSI is currently near 48, recovering from oversold territory, indicating renewed buying strength.• MACD is turning positive with a crossover near the signal line, suggesting improving bullish momentum in the intraday timeframe.4. ADX – Trend Strength:The ADX reading near 24 reflects that the recent downtrend is losing steam, while directional indicators (DI+) are catching up. This hints at the possibility of a near-term trend reversal towards the upside.5. Volume Action:Recent green volume bars indicate accumulation at lower levels, supporting the case for a buy-on-dips approach.Intraday Trade View:• Strategy: Buy on Dips• Entry Zone: ₹99,000 – ₹99,050• Stop-Loss: ₹98,600• Upside Targets:• First Target: ₹99,750 (R2 resistance)• Second Target: ₹1,00,300 – ₹1,00,530 (R3 resistance)• Bias: Bullish above ₹99,000; weakness resumes only if price closes below ₹98,600.Conclusion:With RSI recovering, MACD turning positive, and prices holding above the key pivot support of ₹99,000, the technical setup favors a buy on dips strategy for intraday traders. If gold sustains above ₹99,750, it could open the path towards ₹1,00,500+ in the short term.","Gold rates have been stabilizing and analysts are eyeing a buy on dips strategy.

Jackie Shroff family’s investment pays off: From lakhs to crores- How the Bollywood couple’s Sony TV decision proved to be a bonanza for them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jackie-shroff-familys-investment-pays-off-from-lakhs-to-crores-how-the-bollywood-couples-sony-tv-decision-proved-to-be-a-bonanza-for-them/articleshow/123450105.cms,"JJackie Shroff: Wife Ayesha Left Lavish Life to Live in Mumbai Chawl ACKIE SHROFF

In an industry where star earnings often rise and fall with box-office success, Jackie and Ayesha Shroff’s early bet on television proved to be a defining financial decision. Their timely investment in Sony Entertainment Television’s Indian launch two decades ago turned into their most profitable venture, as reported by Economic Times.Ayesha Shroff, who co-founded Jackie Shroff Entertainment Limited, said in a discussion with Zero1 Hustle by Zerodha that the Sony investment was her first exposure to corporate operations and remains the couple’s best financial decision. “It was much more than that, and if you apply that concept to the deal, it was like Rs 1 lakh to Rs 100 crore back then,” she said.The couple and their seven-member team spent nearly a year negotiating with Sony, combining Jackie Shroff’s celebrity brand with commercial and technical expertise from other partners. A breakthrough came after sustained engagement, eventually leading to Sony’s entry into the Indian television market. The Shroffs retained their stake for 15 years before divesting.“The experience was very exciting, the going back and forth on the deal, the due diligence, the paperwork,” Ayesha recalled. She explained that the association with Sony not only provided strong financial returns but also gave her deep insights into corporate dealmaking.The Shroffs later channelled part of their resources into film production, most notably Boom (2002). However, widespread piracy prior to release led to major financial losses. “We made Boom. Not with all of that (Sony) money, but with a little bit of it. It was just bad luck that the film got pirated and we lost a lot of money,” Ayesha said.",Jackie and Ayesha Shroff's early bet on television proved to be a defining financial decision.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on Friday. While Nifty50 went below 24,900, BSE Sensex ended almost 700 points down. Nifty50 closed the day at 24,870.10, down 214 points or 0.85%. BSE Sensex ended at 81,306.85, down 694 points or 0.85%.The stock market ended its six-day positive streak, as investors exhibited caution before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium and anticipated new US tariffs on Indian products, alongside other factors affecting market sentiment.Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The Indian equity market closed in the red today, ending a six-session winning streak and erasing gains accumulated over the past three days. Investor sentiment turned cautious ahead of the US Fed Chair’s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, which is expected to provide critical insights into the global liquidity outlook and future interest rate trajectory. The US using trade tariffs on India as a strategic tool in its stance against Russia has raised near-term concerns among institutional investors. However, strong domestic indicators offer support: the PMI has hit a record high and recently proposed indirect tax reliefs are expected to boost consumption, underscoring India’s economic resilience.""Investors remained reserved before US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's address at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole conference. Market participants seek information about whether the US central bank will reduce rates by 25 basis points in September as anticipated. Expectations for a rate reduction have decreased following the Fed's July meeting minutes, which revealed disagreements among policymakers.Reduced US interest rates generally increase the attractiveness of emerging markets like India, but current uncertainty has affected market confidence.IT stocks, which had increased by 3% over the past three sessions, declined by 0.6% Friday.The additional 25% tariff on Indian exports announced by US President Donald Trump is set to take effect August 27. These duties could increase the total levies on certain exports to 50%, representing some of the highest rates imposed on any US trade partner.""The headwinds for the market from Trump tariffs will weigh on markets constraining the rally of the last six days,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments. Vijayakumar cautioned that the implemented tariffs could impact India's growth beyond the currently projected 20-30 basis points.Following six consecutive days of gains, the markets witnessed profit-booking, particularly affecting financial and IT sectors, leading to declines across major sector indices, according to an ET report.During the preceding six-day positive streak, the Nifty and Sensex recorded gains of 2.4% and 2.2% respectively, supported by positive sentiment from GST revisions and an improved S&P sovereign rating.The session saw prominent banks including HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank decline by more than 1%. Among sectors, pharmaceutical and consumer durables segments showed resilience, maintaining positive territory whilst others declined.International institutional investors continued to reduce their positions, selling Rs 31,889 crore across eight sectors in early August, with financial and IT sectors seeing significant outflows. Their total equity sales reached Rs 20,976 crore during this period, following July's exit trend and raising 2023's net outflows to approximately Rs 1.2 lakh crore.On August 13, Jefferies reported that foreign portfolio investment levels in India have reached their lowest point in a decade. Despite domestic investments providing some protection against market decline, the firm advised that any upward movements might be short-lived.The Nifty's upward movement stalled near 25,153, reaching Geojit's short-term targets. Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at the firm, indicated that current technical indicators lack the force needed for further advances, although a significant decline appears unlikely.At Kotak Securities, Head of Equity Research Shrikant Chouhan observed market uncertainty following a higher opening. He identified key support levels at 25,000/81,700 and 24,950/81,500, with resistance at 25,150/82,300 and 25,250/82,500. He warned that movement below 24,850/81,200 could trigger negative sentiment.Regarding the Bank Nifty, Chouhan noted an ""inside body"" formation, suggesting potential upward movement to 56,200–56,500 if it crosses 56,000, while a decline below 55,500 could lead to levels of 55,350–55,000.","Nifty50 closed the day at 24,870.10, down 214 points or 0.85%.

Financial inclusion will remain incomplete unless women are equally represented, and we are thus envisaging to introduce additional distribution incentives for investments from first-time women investors,"" he said at an event organised by AMFI, the MF industry trade body.The details of the scheme are being finalised, fund industry officials said. Currently, distributors who bring in new investors from places that are beyond the AMFI's top 30 contributors in terms of fund assets, get Rs 150 for each such investor, while others get Rs 100.The Sebi chairman also asked the MF industry to bring in investors from the grassroots levels through the 'Chhoti SIP' route, the systematic investment plan (SIP) that allows investors to invest with as little as Rs 250. ""This 'sachetisation' of investing opens the door for first-time and small-ticket investors to enter the mutual funds space with confidence.

Shook India's business with hostile bids in early '80s,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/shook-indias-business-with-hostile-bids-in-early-80s/articleshow/123463382.cms,"Mumbai/Kolkata: British-Indian industrialist Swraj Paul passed away on Thursday evening in a London hospital at the age of 94. The founder of Caparo Group had been unwell, leading to his recent hospitalisation.Consistently featured in the 'Sunday Times Rich List', Swraj was ranked 81st this year, with an estimated fortune of £2 billion. His group, which has a play in steel and engineering products, has been managed by his son Akash Paul.During the early 1980s, he shook India's business scene by launching hostile bids to acquire Escorts and DCM. Such attempts were uncommon at the time. These companies had low promoter holdings. However, Swraj faced pushback as the promoters united with financial institutions like LIC and UTI to defend their control. The govt, then headed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, also altered rules concerning non-resident Indian investments in the country. In the end, Swraj retracted his attempts.Born on Feb 18, 1931, in Jalandhar, he was the youngest among four siblings and grew up in modest surroundings. Their father, Pyare Lal, ran a small steel enterprise that became highly profitable during World War II, employing 100 workers.After Pyare Lal's death, the four brothers worked to expand the business and established its headquarters in Kolkata in 1951. The Jalandhar steel operation eventually developed into the Apeejay Group, led by Swraj's elder brother, Satya Paul.Swraj graduated in science from Punjab University before moving to the US to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1966, he moved to the UK in search of medical treatment for his four-year-old daughter Ambika, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, she succumbed to the illness.The incident altered his life, prompting him to establish the Ambika Paul Foundation in her memory, which continues to aid children's health and education.Two years later, in 1968, he established the Caparo Group in London, which now operates in forty countries including the US, Canada and India with a turnover surpassing £1 billion.While he found success in his business ventures, he also endured significant tragedies. In 2015, he lost his son Angad Paul, and seven years later, he experienced the loss of his wife.Swraj enjoyed a strong relationship with Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. She wrote on X: ""He was a business tycoon, a formidable industrialist, a philanthropist, and an icon of global Indian diaspora with deep Kolkata connections. I knew him well and received his affection. We had interacted on joint efforts to develop Bengal.""","British-Indian industrialist Swraj Paul passed away on Thursday evening in a London hospital at the age of 94.

At the same time, institutional safeguards, such as post-approval reviews, a central registry of foreign ownership, conditional approvals (restrictions on board representation, mandatory technology transfer clauses, periodic compliance audits) and inter-agency coordination should be built into the system,"" said a paper by Nisha Taneja, Sanjana Joshi, Vasudha Upreti and Nirlipta Rath.The authors of the report have argued that Press Note 3, which mandates scrutiny of all proposals from countries sharing a land border with India, was hobbling inflows, a stand that has been taken by economists, including chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran, who led the team that recommended a review of the norms.Like the Economic Survey, the paper also makes a case for easing FDI rules to reduce the trade deficit in India, which was just short of $100 billion last fiscal.""By incentivising Chinese firms to set up factories in India, domestic production capacity can be scaled up, local supply chains strengthened and value addition retained within the country. This approach holds particular promise for high-dependence sectors, such as electronics and technology products and components, automobiles and auto-components, and pharmaceuticals, where localisation of production can substantially cut the import bill while fostering technology transfer and job creation. ""Govt has so far maintained that the checks are necessary. The paper also called for an inter-agency committee to streamline FDI approvals from China.From the Chinese side, the policy brief has asked for easing controls on export of critical minerals and heavy rare earth, where licensing has been mandated. ""...exports are not banned but only require a license, which creates an administrative burden on importers and exporters. Thiscan be dealt with by setting up a bilateral mechanism which would address information asymmetries, reduce delays, and facilitate transactions.

But the news of a GST rate cut and impending reduction in retail prices is keeping buyers out of the market till the time a decision finally happens on the ground,"" car and consumer goods companies and retailers told TOI.The situation is the same for white goods retailers, such as TVs, air-conditioners, and dishwashers. ""We are already getting numerous queries from buyers about price cuts and when they will actually happen. Buyers say they will now wait for the price reduction before taking deliveries,"" CEO of one of the top consumer goods companies said.The exercise to rationalise GST rates is likely to see the government bring down the taxes on certain categories of consumer goods and autos.For example, small cars and two-wheelers are likely to see GST rates come down from 28% to 18% slab.For ACs, TVs (larger than 32 inches) and dishwashers, it's a similar reduction in GST that is being anticipated.Companies are in a dilemma now, as price cuts will only happen when GST Council approves the cuts and announces final tax slabs. Consumers, however, have decided to wait rather than purchase, with many even cancelling car bookings.Saharsh Damani, CEO of Federation of Automotive Dealers Association (Fada), said they have already taken up the matter with commerce minister Piyush Goyal and heavy industries minister HD Kumaraswany. ""We are already seeing pressure in Kerala and Maharashtra when it comes to sales conversions.

Mutual funds caution: Sebi chief warns against fraudulent redemptions; promises incentives for women investors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mutual-funds-caution-sebi-chief-warns-against-fraudulent-redemptions-promises-incentives-for-women-investors/articleshow/123459045.cms,"Markets regulator Sebi chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey on Friday cautioned the mutual fund industry that beyond market-linked investment risks, operational risks such as fraudulent redemptions by impersonators pose a growing threat to investor confidence.Speaking at an event organised by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi), Pandey stressed the need for heightened vigilance, urging asset management companies (AMCs) to respond swiftly and track evolving fraud patterns as perpetrators become more sophisticated, PTI reported.Reiterating his point, Pandey said, “Beyond investment risks, we must also be mindful of operational risks that can undermine investor confidence. One such concern is the menace of fraudulent redemptions by impersonators. And as fraudsters grow more creative, we must be more vigilant. Each time such a case is detected, AMCs must act promptly and monitor the evolving patterns in such practices.” He added that such modus operandi should be shared across AMCs and qualified Registrars and Transfer Agents (QRTAs) to prevent recurrence.Pandey further underlined the need for diversification but warned that mutual funds, as a retail product, must exercise caution while investing in micro-cap or debt papers in bespoke deals.He said maintaining proper documentation for such decisions ensures transparency and due diligence.On the inclusion front, Pandey said Sebi is planning additional incentives for investments by first-time female investors. “Financial inclusion will remain incomplete unless women are equally represented. We are thus also envisaging to introduce an additional distribution incentive for investments from first-time women investors,” he noted.He added that Sebi is also proposing incentives for distributors promoting investments from first-time individual investors in B30 cities (tier-2 and tier-3 towns). The move, he said, will help widen the investor base and extend mutual fund penetration into under-represented regions, boosting financial inclusion.Pandey also disclosed that Sebi is reviewing the categorisation of mutual fund schemes to provide greater flexibility for product innovation, improve clarity, and address overlap issues. “These measures are expected to facilitate the industry to become more transparent and investor-friendly,” he said.As part of its ease-of-doing-business initiative, Sebi has already discontinued the requirement of over 52 reports, notices and addendums to be filed by AMCs. The regulator is now working on a comprehensive simplification of mutual fund regulations over the next few months to ease compliance while safeguarding investor interests.At the same event, Sebi Whole Time Member Amarjeet Singh also urged the mutual fund industry to focus on responsible growth while upholding governance and ethical conduct. “We must scale responsibly and in the right manner. A strong culture of ethical behaviour is the best safeguard against the lure of quick wins,” he said, stressing that AMCs must demonstrate their commitment to transparency to retain the trust of regulators and stakeholders.He noted that with intensifying competition, the sector faces pressure to innovate, grow assets under management (AUM), and deliver superior returns. “In such an environment, it can be tempting to chase growth at any cost. Rules and regulations, therefore, play a very vital role in providing the necessary guardrails that protect investors and ensure discipline,” Singh added."," Markets regulator Sebi chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey cautioned the mutual fund industry that operational risks such as fraudulent redemptions by impersonators pose a growing threat to investor confidence.

Indranil Bhattacharyya to replace Rajiv Ranjan in RBI MPC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indranil-bhattacharyya-to-replace-rajiv-ranjan-in-rbi-mpc/articleshow/123459040.cms,"Mumbai: The RBI board on Friday cleared the nomination of executive director Indranil Bhattacharyya as an ex-officio member of the monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates. He replaces Rajiv Ranjan ahead of the October 2025 policy meet.Bhattacharyya, a JNU economics postgraduate, has nearly three decades of central banking experience. He joined RBI in 1996 after a brief stint at the Indian Institute of Capital Markets, worked at the Qatar Central Bank as an economic expert from 2009 to 2014, before returning to RBI.In a 2015 paper he co-wrote, Bhattacharya argued that the central bank’s decisions strongly influence financial markets, but also that the RBI should pay close attention to signals coming from bond yields and borrowing costs for companies. He suggested looking at all policy tools together rather than just one rate, noted that markets and the RBI influence each other, and stressed that keeping the financial system stable is as important as controlling inflation.An earlier paper he co-authored on monetary policy signals found that markets respond more strongly when the RBI tightens policy than when it eases, and that instruments like the cash reserve ratio and bank rate significantly shape money flow and interest rates.The study also noted that policy transmission is uneven, as different tools have limits and markets react differently over time.The six-member MPC has three RBI representatives — governor Sanjay Malhotra (chairperson), deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao and Bhattacharyya — and three external members: economist Saugata Bhattacharya, ISID chief Nagesh Kumar, and Delhi School of Economics director Ram Singh.The RBI board, which met in Lucknow under Malhotra’s chairmanship, reviewed the global and domestic economic landscape, financial market developments, and institutional functioning.

Other attendees included DFS secretary Nagaraju Maddirala, DEA secretary Anuradha Thakur, Satish Marathe, Revathy Iyer, Sachin Chaturvedi, Anand Mahindra, Pankaj Patel and Ravindra Dholakia.The meeting took place amid heightened risks from global trade and geopolitics. A 25% US tariff on Indian exports such as textiles, leather, gems and seafood from late August is expected to shave 20-30 basis points off GDP growth, RBI estimates. Concerns over energy security linked to Russian oil supplies also weighed on discussions.","Bhattacharyya, a JNU economics postgraduate, has nearly three decades of central banking experience.

The Menendez brothers are set to appear for parole board hearings this week after spending nearly 30 years in prison for killing their parents.Erik and Lyle Menendez were convicted of first-degree murder and were sentenced to life in prison in 1996 for fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989.The brothers, now 57 and 54, were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Lyle and Erik Menendez were the sons of Jose Menendez, who was a Cuban-American business executive who once held a senior position at RCA Record.In May, their sentences were reduced by a Los Angeles judge to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole under California's youth offender law because they were under the age of 26 when they committed their crimes.While defense attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, prosecutors said the brothers sought a multimillion-dollar inheritance.A panel of parole hearing officers will evaluate the brothers individually. Erik Menendez will have his hearing on Thursday morning, followed by Lyle Menendez on Friday. They will appear over videoconference from prison in San Diego.The board will determine if the brothers present an “unreasonable risk of danger to society” upon release, taking into account their criminal record, motive for the crime, expressions of remorse, conduct in prison, and future plans, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said.The Menendez brothers' appellate attorney, Mark Geragos, has said their parole hearings should be about redemption and not about relitigating the facts of the case.Several family members came forward to express forgiveness and advocate for their freedom from prison. These relatives indicated they had moved past the trauma of the murders and believed the brothers deserved a second chance after nearly 30 years of incarceration.","Erik and Lyle Menendez were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996.

'Eliminating all retaliatory tariffs on US goods': Canada's big announcement; move comes day after Carney-Trump talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eliminating-all-retaliatory-tariffs-on-us-goods-canadas-big-announcement-move-comes-day-after-carney-trump-talks/articleshow/123458530.cms,"Prime Minister Mark Carney on Friday announced that Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs on US goods, aligning with Washington's recent decision to exempt products covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).Speaking a day after a call with US President Donald Trump , PM Carney told reporters that starting September 1, Canada would be ""eliminating all Canadian tariffs on American goods"" covered under the pact.He added this move comes as both countries ""intensify"" discussions on a broader trade deal.""Canada currently has the best trade deal with the United States. And while it’s different from what we had before, it's still better than that of any other country,"" Carney said.""Canada and the United States have reestablished free trade for the vast majority of our goods. Canada will retain our tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos as we work intensively to resolve the issues there,"" he added.With the USMCA scheduled for review in 2026, Carney described the pact as a ""unique advantage"" for Canada, noting that the US is increasingly charging other countries for market access.The Canadian PM noted that America's commitment to the agreement ensures Canadian exporters still benefit from one of the lowest average US tariff rates, with more than 85% of bilateral trade remaining tariff-free.Canadian and Mexican firms also continue to receive preferential access under the USMCA, AP reported.The retaliatory tariffs were introduced under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after Washington imposed duties on Canadian goods. However, the Trump administration later exempted USMCA-covered products, prompting Ottawa’s latest move.While most Canadian and Mexican imports remain protected by the trade pact, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has signaled fresh uncertainty, saying, ""I think the president is absolutely going to renegotiate the USMCA.""Earlier, Trump also signed an executive order raising tariffs on Canadian imports to the United States from 25% to 35%.The tariff applies to all items not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. A 40% transshipment levy would apply to goods rerouted through another country to avoid these tariffs.At the same time, Canada still faces sector-specific US levies outside the deal that continue to weigh on the industry.Since March, Trump implemented various Canadian tariffs: 25% on all goods excluding potash and energy products, 10% on energy resources including potash, 50% on steel and aluminium imports, and 25% on automotive products.Trade experts note that preserving the free trade pact will be crucial for both Canada and Mexico, with more than 75% of Canadian exports and 80% of Mexican exports heading to the US.","Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs on US goods, aligning with Washington's recent decision to exempt products covered under the USMCA.

Powell warns of uncertainties due to Trump's tariffs

Trump a strong critic of Powell

US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated on Friday that a potential rate reduction could occur during September's central bank meeting. However, he maintained a balanced stance, refraining from making definitive commitments about interest rate cuts. His comments acknowledged mounting concerns about employment conditions whilst emphasising that inflation risks continue to persist.Delivering a speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, Powell said, “Risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside, a challenging situation when our goals, our intention like this, our framework calls for us to balance both sides of our dual mandate. Our policy rate is now 100 basis points closer to neutral than it was a year ago, and the stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance. ”“Nonetheless, with policy and restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance. Policy is not on a preset course. FOMC members will make these decisions based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks, we will never deviate from that approach,” he said.“While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers. This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising, and if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,” Powell said.“At the same time, GDP growth has slowed, notably in the first half of this year, to a pace of 1.2%, roughly half the 2.5% pace in 2024. The decline in growth has largely reflected a slowdown in consumer spending, as with the labor market. Some of the slowing in GDP likely reflects slower growth of supply or potential output.""We continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags its effects on the economy. For this reason, our policy actions depend on the economic outlook and the balance of risks to that outlook,"" he said.“This year, the economy has faced new challenges, significantly higher tariffs across our trading partners are remaking the global trading system. Tighter immigration policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labor force growth over the longer run, changes in tax, spending and regulatory policies may also have important implications for economic growth and productivity. There is significant uncertainty about where all of these policies will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be,” Powell cautioned.“Changes in trade and immigration policies are affecting both demand and supply in this environment. Distinguishing cyclical developments from trend or structural developments is difficult. This distinction is critical, because monetary policy can work to stabilize cyclical fluctuations, but can do little to alter structural changes,” he said.“When I appeared at this podium one year ago. The economy was at an inflection point. Our policy rate had stood at five and a quarter to five and a half percent for more than a year. That restrictive policy stance was appropriate to help bring down inflation and to foster a sustainable balance between aggregate demand and supply, inflation had moved much closer to our objective, and the labor market had cooled from its formerly overheated state upside. Risks to inflation had diminished, but the unemployment rate had increased by almost a full percentage point, a development that historically has not occurred outside of recessions,” Powell said at the start of his speech.“Over the subsequent three Federal Open Market Committee meetings, we recalibrated our policy stance, setting the stage for the labor market to remain in balance near maximum employment over the past year,” he said.This is Powell’s last Jackson Hole speech as the US Federal Reserve chairperson. His tenure concludes in May 2026.The Federal Reserve, scheduled to convene its next policy meeting in mid-September, has maintained interest rates between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent since their last decrease in December.The decision to keep rates steady was influenced by the strong labour market performance, as officials assessed the impact of Trump's comprehensive tariffs on America's economy.According to analysts, increased import tariffs could lead to price increases. The Federal Reserve generally maintains elevated interest rates as a strategy to control inflation effectively.The Federal Reserve chairperson's keynote address at last year's Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium suggested potential interest rate reductions, but experts caution the situation is less clear at present.""The Fed is in a tough position as inflation remains above target and downside risks to the labor market are intensifying,"" said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics according to an AFP report.US President Donald Trump has openly expressed his criticism of Powell, consistently stating that the Federal Reserve chairman has been ""too late"" in reducing interest rates whilst labelling him a ""numbskull"" and ""moron.""Trump criticised Powell regarding the Federal Reserve's headquarters refurbishment in Washington, suggesting that excessive expenses could warrant the central banker's dismissal.Trump later abandoned this stance but recently demanded Fed governor Lisa Cook's resignation, citing allegations of mortgage fraud.In response, Cook issued a statement declaring that she had ""no intention of being bullied to step down"" whilst noting her commitment to addressing questions about her financial records.","US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated on Friday that a potential rate reduction could occur during September's central bank meeting.

TSMC is the world’s largest chip maker.“I'm offering a new product to China for ... AI data centres, the follow-on to H20,” Huang said. “But that’s not our decision to make. It’s up to, of course, the United States government. And we're in dialogue with them, but it's too soon to know.”The B30A would be based on Nvidia’s Blackwell technology and is said to run at about half the speed of the company’s flagship B300 chips. Top-end Nvidia processors remain barred from China under US restrictions that seek to limit Beijing’s access to advanced computing power for military and AI applications.Huang praised the Trump administration for recently clearing the sale of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China, which had been halted in April. Approval was granted with a condition that Nvidia pay a 15% tax to the US government on such sales. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was asked to pay the same levy on exports of its MI380 chips to China.The approval was part of wider trade talks in which Washington and Beijing agreed to scale back some non-tariff measures. China granted additional permits for exports of rare earth magnets to the US, while Washington removed restrictions on chip design software and jet engines. Following Huang’s lobbying efforts, Nvidia was also allowed to resume H20 sales to Chinese customers.Asked about the tax condition, Huang declined to comment directly but said Nvidia valued the chance to sell H20 chips to China. He also rejected suggestions that such sales carried security risks for the US.“We have made very clear and put to rest that H20 has no security backdoors. There are no such things. There never has. And so hopefully the response that we've given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,” Huang said. He added that Nvidia was also in talks with Beijing to assure regulators about the product’s integrity.China’s Cyberspace Administration had recently posted a notice online raising what it called “serious security issues” in Nvidia’s chips. Citing US AI experts, it alleged the processors included “mature tracking and location and remote shutdown technologies.” Nvidia was asked to clarify these claims and provide documentation.Huang said the company was surprised by the accusations. “As you know, they requested and urged us to secure licenses for the H20s for some time. And I’ve worked quite hard to help them secure the licenses. And so hopefully this will be resolved,” he said.Reports in Chinese media have suggested authorities were also angered by comments from US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who argued that Washington’s policy was to limit China’s access to cutting-edge chips.“We don't sell them our best stuff,” Lutnick told CNBC. “Not our second-best stuff. Not even our third best, but I think fourth best is where we've come out that we're cool.”China’s ruling Communist Party has prioritised self-reliance in advanced technology but continues to rely heavily on foreign semiconductor know-how.",Jensen Huang said the company is holding talks with the Trump administration over a potential new semiconductor for China.

"The US and EU release a bare-bones account of their trade deal, but it's a work in progress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-us-and-eu-release-a-bare-bones-account-of-their-trade-deal-but-its-a-work-in-progress/articleshow/123443135.cms,"BRUSSELS: American and European Union officials released a bare-bones account Thursday of their trade deal that imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States, but they left blank key areas such as wine and spirits as well as steel and indicated that talks would continue on those and a slew of other important sectors.The two sides said the document was only ""a first step in a process that can be further expanded to cover additional areas."" They are dealing with the vast range of goods traded between the two economies in what is the largest bilateral trading relationship in the world, involving $2 trillion in annual trans-Atlantic business.The 3 1/2-page text represents a political commitment and is not legally binding. It contrasts with the typical format for trade agreements, which can be hundreds of pages long and carry legal force.The key provisions are the 15% tariff on most EU goods, a zero rate on U.S. cars and other industrial goods exported to the 27-member EU, and a range of exceptions to the 15% rate for aircraft and aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients, with other sectors to be added for goods crucial to each other's economies. Those goods would face lower tariffs from before President Donald Trump's tariff onslaught.""The EU has agreed to open its $20 Trillion market,"" Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said on X. ""The second largest in the world behind the great USA.""He said the deal was ""a major win for American workers, US industries, and our national security. Tariffs should be one of America's favorite words.""European officials have had to defend the deal against dismay from businesses and member governments at the higher tariffs and criticism that the EU gave away too much. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sold the deal as granting quick relief from the even higher U.S. tariff on EU cars of 27.5% and as opening the way for further negotiations that could exclude more goods from the 15% tariffs. The deal provides that the lower tariff on cars would apply retroactively from Aug. 1 if the EU can introduce legislation to implement its part of the deal by then, which EU officials say they will do.""Faced with a challenging situation, we have delivered for our member states and industry and restored clarity and coherence to transatlantic trade,"" von der Leyen said. ""This is not the end of the process.""The chief EU trade negotiator, Maros Sefcovic, echoed those sentiments. ""The alternative was a trade war with sky high tariffs ... it builds confidence. It brings stability,"" he said.Economists say higher tariffs slow economic growth and will be reflected in higher consumer prices.One category of goods not excluded from tariffs on EU goods was wine and spirits, which had enjoyed zero tariffs on both ends since a 1997 trade deal. Sefcovic, said EU officials had not won an exemption ""yet"" but hoped to in future talks and that ""doors are not closed forever"" on that issue.That means American distillers face zero tariffs in Europe the short term, but also the possibility of EU retaliation down the line, said Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. ""Without a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs on spirits, American distillers do not have the certainty to plan for future export and job growth without the fear of retaliatory tariffs returning,"" Swonger said in a statement.The EU has suspended retaliatory tariffs on US goods including wine and spirits until Feb. 5, 2026.Proposals to exempt a certain amount of EU steel imports, known as a tariff rate quota, have been left unresolved pending more talks.The 15% tariff is much higher than tariff levels on both sides from before Trump began imposing his tariffs, when they averaged in the low single digits. The tariffs are paid on the U.S. end, either absorbed by American businesses importing the goods, lowering their profits, or passed on to U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices at the cash register.The deal also includes nonbinding EU commitments to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and for EU companies to invest $600 billion in the U.S. In both cases, the money would come from private companies and is based on assessment by the European Commission on what companies were planning to spend.",The deal imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States.

Tariffs aren't keeping Walmart from attracting shoppers and outpacing Target,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tariffs-arent-keeping-walmart-from-attracting-shoppers-and-outpacing-target/articleshow/123437135.cms,"FILE - Shoppers walk from the Walmart store, Aug. 14, 2025, in Manchester, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, file)

NEW YORK: Walmart Inc. powered through an uncertain economic environment and tariff concerns to deliver solid second-quarter financial results Thursday, showing it keeps pulling in shoppers and outpacing peers like Target.The nation's largest retailer reported a 4.6% quarterly increase in comparable sales - those coming from established stores and online channels. Company executives said Walmart was attracting customers, particularly higher-income shoppers who may have avoided its stores in the past, with fast deliveries, grocery discounts and trendier clothes.The company, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, also raised its annual profit and sales outlook.Walmart's results differed notably from those of rival Target, which on Wednesday reported another quarter of comparable sales declines. The Minneapolis-based company has struggled to find its footing as customers defect to Walmart and other stores where they think they will find greater bargains and increasingly, the same or better merchandise.Target's board of directors named a 20-year company veteran on Wednesday to succeed CEO Brian Cornell when he steps down after 11 years in early 2026.Walmart said its profitable e-commerce operations, advertising revenue and selection of products with high profit margins have given it flexibility to absorb extra costs from the range of tariffs President Donald Trump has put on foreign products.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors Thursday that the impact of tariffs also has been gradual enough to mute changes in consumer spending behavior. When the discounter raised prices on certain items, it's observed lower- and middle-income customers trading down to lower-priced options or foregoing purchases, he said.The company will continue to see its costs increase as it replenishes inventory at post-tariff price levels, McMillion said.""We're doing what we said we would do,"" he said. ""We're keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can. Our merchants have been creative and acted with urgency to avoid what would have been additional pressure for our customers and members.""A growing list of companies, including Procter & Gamble, E.lf. Cosmetics, Black & Decker and Ralph Lauren, told investors in recent weeks that they planned to or already had raised prices because of tariffs, though modestly.None of that has derailed consumer spending. Shoppers spent at a healthy pace in July, particularly at the nation's auto dealerships, as signs emerged that President Donald Trump's trade policies were taking a toll on jobs.Some of that spending may have been shoppers buying furniture and other imported items to get ahead of expected price increases, analysts said.On Tuesday, Home Depot, the nation's largest home improvement retailer, reported improved sales during its latest quarter as consumers remained focused on smaller projects. Like Walmart, Home Depot's performance missed Wall Street's expectations.The Atlanta-based company also said shoppers should expect modest price increases in some categories as a result of additional costs from tariffs, which are taxes on imports. Home Depot reported comparable sales increase of 1.4% in line with what home improvement rival Lowe's reported on Wednesday.But it's Walmart that serves as a barometer of spending given its outsized power in American retailing. The company maintains that 90% of US households rely on Walmart for a range of products, and more than 150 million customers shop on its website or in its stores every week.Walmart said in May that prices had started to increase in late April and got higher in May. But it said Thursday that it had introduced 7,400 price rollbacks, or temporary discounts, across the aisles in the latest quarter.The company said it earned $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the three-month period that ended July 31. That compares with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year ago.Sales rose nearly 5% to $177.4 billion. Walmart's 4.6% growth in US comparable sales during the second quarter was slightly higher than its first-quarter gain of 4.5%. Groceries and health and wellness items fueled the growth, the company said.Global e-commerce sales rose 25%, above the 22% growth in the first quarter.The retailer said roughly one-third of deliveries from its US stores in recent weeks were orders requesting delivery in three hours or less, and 20% of those orders made it to customers in a half-hour or under.Despite Walmart's solid quarter, its stock price was down close to 5% late Thursday morning as its earnings per share came in below what analysts had expected. Analysts were expecting 73 cents per share on sales of $175.93 billion for the quarter, according to FactSet.Per share results, excluding effects of charges related to certain legal matters and from business restructuring, was 68 cents, Walmart said.One $450 million expense was tied to settlements over worker and shopper injury claims, Walmart said. A company spokesperson said the cost per claim was increasing but not the total number.For the year, Walmart raised its per-share estimates to a range of $2.52 to $2.62, up from a previous estimate of $2.50 to $2.60. It said 2025 sales are anticipated to increase 3.75% to 4.75%, more than it projected in May.","The nation's largest retailer reported a 4.6% quarterly increase in comparable sales - those coming from established stores and online channels.

Markets watch as Powell holds ground

Why

Fed independence

matters

Trump’s pressure campaign

How much control presidents really have

Powell’s balancing act

The battle over the independence of the US Federal Reserve has intensified, with President Donald Trump openly calling for the resignation of a governor, threatening to fire Chair Jerome Powell, and repeatedly pressuring the central bank to cut interest rates. The escalating confrontation has revived a long-running debate over why the Fed has historically been insulated from direct White House influence — and why markets, economists, and past experience suggest that independence is critical.This week, Trump demanded that Fed governor Lisa Cook step down after a mortgage fraud allegation, which she has flatly denied, saying she would not be “bullied” into leaving her post. The move came just ahead of Powell’s much-watched speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, his last as chair before his term ends in May 2026.The Fed, which sets interest rates and manages the world’s largest economy’s monetary policy, has long been one of Washington’s few independent power centers, AP reported. But Trump has repeatedly railed against Powell for refusing to cut borrowing costs, arguing that high interest rates are slowing growth and raising the government’s debt-servicing bill.At one point, the president even accused Powell of mismanaging a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed’s headquarters, an allegation that economists dismissed as political theatre.For Wall Street, Powell’s stance matters. The Fed has kept its benchmark rate at 4.3% for five straight meetings, a level meant to tame inflation but one that also keeps mortgages, auto loans, and business borrowing expensive. Powell has said the central bank needs more time to assess the impact of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on inflation and growth.But the economic picture has grown murkier. July’s jobs report showed weaker-than-expected hiring, casting doubt on Powell’s earlier description of the labour market as “solid.” Inflation, meanwhile, ticked higher in July, with core prices rising 3.1% from a year ago — above the Fed’s 2% target. That leaves Powell trapped between sluggish employment that argues for a rate cut and stubborn inflation that argues against it.Most economists expect Powell to hint at a possible cut later this year without committing to one in September, disappointing investors who have priced in an earlier move. “The dilemma that the Fed is in has become, if anything, more intense,” said David Wilcox, former Fed economist and now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.The stakes go beyond one rate decision. Economists warn that allowing a president to dictate monetary policy could undermine confidence in US markets, push up government borrowing costs, and stoke inflation. The Fed’s credibility rests on its ability to make unpopular decisions when necessary, such as raising rates even when politicians want easy money.That lesson was seared into economic memory in the 1970s, when then-Fed Chair Arthur Burns, under pressure from President Richard Nixon, kept rates low heading into the 1972 election. Inflation spiralled, and the US endured years of economic pain. It took Paul Volcker, appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1979, to impose brutally high rates of nearly 20% — triggering a deep recession but ultimately taming runaway prices. Volcker’s defiance is now seen as a defining example of why central banks must stand apart from day-to-day politics.Trump has made little secret of his frustration with Powell. He has accused him of mishandling inflation, mismanaging Fed operations, and blocking growth. At a recent tour of the Fed’s renovation project, Trump tried to publicly embarrass Powell by claiming costs had soared to $3.1 trillion, a figure Powell calmly dismissed as including unrelated expenses.The president’s attacks are unusual in their intensity, though not unprecedented. Past presidents, from Lyndon Johnson to Ronald Reagan, have privately leaned on Fed chiefs. What sets Trump apart is his willingness to air those grievances in public and to threaten removal of officials whose terms are protected by law.Legal experts say the president cannot fire a Fed chair simply for policy disagreements. The Supreme Court has signaled that removal would require “cause” — such as misconduct or negligence. That may explain why Trump has focused on the renovation controversy as a potential pretext. Still, any attempt to oust Powell would likely spark a court battle and roil global markets.Despite its independence, the Fed is not unaccountable. The president appoints all seven members of its governing board, subject to Senate confirmation, and over time can reshape policy direction. Trump will get his chance when Powell’s term ends in May 2026.Congress also has a role: in 1977, it gave the Fed its “dual mandate” to pursue stable prices and maximum employment. The chair must testify before lawmakers twice a year, offering public explanations of the Fed’s decisions.For now, however, Powell and his colleagues retain their votes on interest-rate policy. Even if Trump replaced Powell tomorrow, the 12-member rate-setting committee could still resist political pressure. That is precisely why markets prize Fed independence: it makes decisions more predictable, less politicized, and more credible.As Powell prepares to deliver his Jackson Hole speech, he faces one of the most delicate balancing acts of his career. The Fed must decide whether to prioritize cooling inflation, which risks choking growth, or cutting rates to cushion a slowing economy, which risks igniting prices.Either way, his words will be parsed by investors, politicians, and global markets alike. For Trump, the stakes are political; for Powell, institutional. For the Fed, it is about preserving a legacy of independence that, economists say, has safeguarded US stability for decades.","Trump has repeatedly railed against Powell for refusing to cut borrowing costs.

That figure also represented a 0.8% increase compared with July last year, surpassing economists’ expectations of a 3.92 million pace, data from FactSet showed, reported AP.Home prices continued their upward run for the 25th straight month, but the rate of growth slowed considerably. The national median sales price inched up just 0.2% year-on-year to $422,400. “The ever-so-slight improvement in housing affordability is inching up home sales,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “Wage growth is now comfortably outpacing home price growth, and buyers have more choices.”The US housing market has struggled since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows, leading to the lowest sales level in nearly three decades last year.The 2024 spring homebuying season, traditionally the busiest for real estate, failed to pick up momentum as high mortgage rates deterred many prospective buyers.The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained high this year, though it dropped to a 10-month low of 6.58% last week. Many of July’s purchases were likely contracted in May and June, when rates ranged from 6.76% to 6.89%. In July, mortgage rates eased further, briefly touching 6.67%.The slowdown in sales has coincided with an increase in unsold homes. NAR data showed 1.55 million unsold properties at the end of July, up 0.6% from June and 15.7% from July last year — the highest in five years, though still short of the pre-pandemic norm of around 2 million homes. “Now, with more inventory buyers (are) in a much better position to negotiate for better prices,” Yun noted.At the current sales pace, July’s inventory represents a 4.6-month supply, down slightly from 4.7 months in June but above the 4-month supply recorded last year. A balanced market between buyers and sellers is typically seen at 5-6 months of supply.Properties are also taking longer to close. Homes remained on the market for an average of 28 days in July, compared with 24 days in the same month a year ago, NAR said.","Existing home sales rose 2% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units.

Report

US aviation major Boeing is negotiating a potential sale of as many as 500 aircraft to Chinese companies, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the discussions.A deal of this scale would mark a significant boost for the struggling manufacturer, whose shares rose as much as 3.7% in pre-market trading before settling with gains of less than 1% about 15 minutes into Tuesday’s session.According to Bloomberg, the agreement would depend heavily on Washington and Beijing securing a longer-term settlement in their ongoing trade dispute. The report said Chinese officials have already begun assessing the aircraft requirements of domestic carriers.Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has used tariffs as leverage against key US trading partners, arguing that deficits reflect unfair practices. Purchases from Boeing, the nation’s largest manufacturing exporter, have often featured in Trump’s trade negotiations to balance imbalances.In July, the White House announced that Japan had committed to buy 100 Boeing aircraft and Indonesia 50 as part of broader trade understandings aimed at avoiding higher tariffs.China, however, has been the main target of Trump’s trade overhaul. Both countries imposed steep tariffs on each other’s products this year, including restrictions that temporarily halted Boeing deliveries. The two sides agreed in May to roll back duties temporarily, later extending the suspension by 90 days as talks continue.China’s last large Boeing order came in November 2017 during Trump’s state visit, when Beijing agreed to purchase 300 planes worth more than $37 billion.Boeing, meanwhile, is trying to regain footing after years of setbacks. In July, the company reported a narrower second-quarter loss and its highest delivery tally since 2018. But its reputation remains clouded by safety and quality control concerns, including a near-catastrophic fuselage blowout on a 737 MAX in January 2024, which came after two fatal crashes of the same aircraft type in 2018 and 2019.",Boeing shares rose as much as 3.7% in pre-market trading before settling with gains of less than 1% about 15 minutes into Tuesday’s session.

The retail giant reported solid revenue growth and raised its full-year profit guidance, but expectations had been high going into the earnings release. The Arkansas-based company’s stock had already gained 13.5% this year, well above the broader market.Investors continued to scrutinise Big Tech valuations, questioning whether stock prices had risen too far on artificial intelligence excitement.

On the upside, Nordson rose 7.4% after both profit and revenue for the quarter topped forecasts.In the bond market, Treasury yields edged higher even as fresh data pointed to economic softness. Weekly jobless claims rose, hinting at potential layoffs, while a mid-Atlantic manufacturing survey showed contraction. The 10-year Treasury yield inched up to 4.30% from 4.29%, and the two-year yield rose to 3.75% from 3.74%.Wall Street continues to expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates in September, which would be its first move this year. A rate cut could support growth by lowering borrowing costs for homes, cars, and business investment, though it risks fuelling inflation.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

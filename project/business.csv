Rupee in red: Currency drops 10 paise in early trade; trades at 90.44 against US dollar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-in-red-currency-drops-10-paise-in-early-trade-trades-at-90-44-against-us-dollar/articleshow/126557444.cms,"Rupee extended its losing streak for a third consecutive session on Friday, slipping 10 paise to 90.44 against the US dollar. Persistent foreign fund outflows, and a stronger greenback, continued to drag down the domestic currency. In early interbank trade, rupee opened at 90.37 before drifting further to 90.44, down from its previous close.Earlier on Wednesday, the currency ended at 90.34, a decline of 11 paise, after a 6-paise drop the day before. Forex markets remained closed on Thursday for the Mumbai municipal corporation elections. Traders noted that the fall in rupee was cushioned by declining crude oil prices and a positive mood in the equity markets, which helped check sharper losses.Globally, the dollar index, which gauges the US currency’s performance against six major currencies, was marginally lower, slipping 0.02% to 99.10. Analysts said the dollar’s movement followed the release of US inflation data for December, which has lowered expectations of an immediate interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.Pressure on Rupee further increased after official data released on Thursday showed India’s trade deficit widening slightly to $25.04 billion in December 2025, against a deficit of $24.53 billion in November and $22 billion in December 2024.Meanwhile in the commodities market, Brent crude was trading 0.34% lower at $63.54 per barrel in futures trade.On the domestic equities front, benchmark indices opened higher.

Shares of Infosys rose sharply on Friday, climbing over 5% on both the NSE and BSE after the IT major raised its FY26 constant-currency revenue growth guidance to 3–3.5% while maintaining its operating margin outlook at 20–22%. At 11 am, the stock was trading 5.04% or 80 points higher, reaching 1,679.65 on the BSE. On the NSE, Infosys gained 5.05%, also adding 80 points, to trade at 1,680.60.The stock followed a Q3 report showing a 2% year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit, which stood at Rs 6,654 crore compared with Rs 6,806 crore a year ago. Revenue from operations, however, grew 9% YoY to Rs 45,479 crore.At the same time, the company’s American Depository Receipts (ADRs) also climbed sharply, hitting an intraday peak of $19.45 before closing at $19.35, up 10.4% from Thursday’s $18.82. In total, ADRs have surged more than 7% over the past two sessions, ET reported.Brokerages remained largely constructive on Infosys following the guidance upgrade, though views varied on near-term performance.Nomura maintained its Buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,810, citing the company’s decision to raise its FY26 constant-currency revenue growth guidance from 2–3% to 3–3.5%.Elara Capital, meanwhile, retained its 'Accumulate' rating and increased its target price to Rs 1,770. The brokerage said Q3 revenue came in ahead of expectations, aided by the NHS deal, while margins were also better than anticipated. The brokerage cited strong performance in the first nine months of FY26 and healthy deal wins, which led to the IT giant revising its FY26 revenue growth guidance to 3–3.5%, up from the earlier 2–3% range. It added that to meet the revised outlook, Q4 growth would need to be between -1.7% and +0.2%, which it believes is achievable. The brokerage also flagged signs of recovery in discretionary spending within the BFSI segment, ET reported.Emkay Global also maintained its Buy rating with a target price of Rs 1,750, describing the third-quarter performance as mixed. While revenue exceeded estimates with 0.6% sequential growth in constant-currency terms, adjusted EBIT margin declined 20 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 20.8%. Emkay added that the revised guidance does not factor in potential revenue from the pending Telstra joint venture, reflecting caution at the lower end amid macro uncertainty, while a more optimistic scenario is built into the upper end. Earnings estimates for FY26–28 have been adjusted in the range of -2.1% to +0.5% to reflect the Q3 outcome.","Shares of Infosys rose sharply on Friday, climbing over 5% on both the NSE and BSE.

Budget 2026 expectations for defence: Why capital outlay should be hiked for ‘Atmanirbharta’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-for-defence-why-capital-outlay-should-be-hiked-for-atmanirbharta-in-defence-drdo-operation-sindoor-4-points-to-focus-on/articleshow/126516015.cms,"Budget 2026 for defence: FICCI has advocated for higher emphasis on ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence, with modern techniques.

Defence Spending Can Fuel Growth, Says CDS Anil Chauhan As India Rethinks Guns Versus Butter Debate

Defence Budget 2026 - 4 Point Approach

FICCI notes that in Budget 2025, the Ministry of Defence was allocated Rs 6,81,210.27 crore for FY 2025–26. This was a 9.53% rise over the Budget Estimates for FY 2024–25. The industry body suggests that while the government maintains the growth of approximately 10% in the overall budgetary support for the Ministry of Defence in the coming year, the share of capital outlay should be increased to 30% from around 26% earlier. “Additional capital outlay will help in modernisation of military infrastructure, particularly for investments in frontline assets, UAVs, counter UAV systems, electronic warfare systems and air defence systems in border areas,” it says.

FICCI is of the view that the budgetary allocation for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) needs to be stepped up. Last year the budget was increased by 12.4% to Rs 26,816.82 crore in FY 2025–26. “The overall allocation for DRDO should be increased by Rs 10,000 crore in the upcoming budget. This will financially strengthen the DRDO in developing new technologies with special focus on fundamental research for frontier technologies in collaboration with private parties through flagship scheme of DRDO i.e. Technology Development Fund and will assist the development of Deep Technology in the defence sector.”

The industry body notes that under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, the government has made notable progress in defence indigenisation through setting up of Defence Industrial Corridors in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. This momentum needs to be strengthened further, says FICCI, advocating for establishing an Eastern India Defence Industrial Corridor. “Synchronising with the ‘Purvodaya Scheme’ , it would rejuvenate the industrial clusters in Eastern India and shall spur job creation, stimulate R&D, and establish India as a global hub for defence exports, while securing national interests across all three borders,” FICCI says.

Budget 2026 should also focus on giving an impetus to defence exports which have risen at a compound annual growth rate of 46% between 2016–17 and 2023–24. This has largely been driven by higher exports from private sector firms. The central government aims to achieve defence exports worth Rs 50,000 crore by 2028-29. FICCI suggests that the government considers setting up a Defence Export Promotion Council (DEPC) that can co-ordinate with armed services, their foreign directorates, DPSUs, private manufacturers, MEA, Indian embassies, and MoD and communicate with foreign governments and buyers.

Budget 2026 for defence: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s Union Budget 2026 should look to prioritise growth-enhancing productive capital expenditure, with a special focus on the defence sector at a time when the global environment is marked with uncertainty, says FICCI in its pre-Budget memorandum.According to the industry body, India needs to lay special emphasis on technology-driven defence innovation. “India’s external security environment today is marked by heightened uncertainty and rise in disputes and conflicts. India’s adversaries are investing heavily in advanced military technologies such as autonomous weapons, hypersonic systems, UAV swarms, and AI-enabled warfare, posing heightened risks. A strong, modern, and well-resourced defence architecture has thus become critical for safeguarding India’s territorial integrity and preserving strategic autonomy,” FICCI has said in its Budget 2026 wishlist.FICCI has advocated for higher emphasis on ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence, with modern techniques using artificial intelligence, and not just platform-driven enhancements.“Future warfare will be defined by technology-driven, multi-domain and information-centric operations. Conflicts will increasingly span land, air, sea, cyber, space and electromagnetic spectrum domains. For India, preparing for such challenges requires a shift from platform-centric to networked, integrated, AI-enabled capabilities backed by robust indigenous defence innovation,” it says.According to FICCI, increasing the defence budget should not just be about a budgetary choice but a strategic imperative. So what should the Union Budget 2026 for defence focus on? FICCI advocates a four-pronged approach:","In Budget 2025, the Ministry of Defence was allocated Rs 6,81,210.27 crore for FY 2025–26. FICCI has advocated for higher emphasis on ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence, with modern techniques. The share of capital outlay should be increased to 30% from around 26% earlier.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126516286,imgsize-76226,width-400,resizemode-4/budget-2026-for-defence.jpg"

Benchmark indices traded with a downward bias as investors remained cautious amid a risk-off environment. Persistent selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), coupled with escalating geopolitical tensions in regions including Venezuela, Greenland, and Iran, weighed on market sentiment. Additionally, investors are closely tracking the ongoing Q3FY26 earnings season and developments related to India–US trade negotiations. The combination of global uncertainties, geopolitical risks, and trade-related concerns led to elevated risk aversion, resulting in subdued market performance.The index traded with heightened volatility and formed a bearish candle during Wednesday’s session, marking a lower high and lower low. This price action indicates ongoing consolidation amid increased stock-specific movements, as the Q3FY26 earnings season gets underway.Nifty is currently consolidating near its 100-day exponential moving average (EMA). On the downside, Monday’s panic low of 25,473 is expected to serve as an immediate key support level. On the upside, the 25,950–26,050 zone is likely to act as immediate resistance, as it coincides with the 20-day EMA and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of last week’s decline.Overall Nifty is likely to consolidate in the range of 26000-25,500 only a breakout or a breakdown will signal the next directional moveBank Nifty continues to outperform the Nifty, displaying clear relative strength as it continues to consolidate around 60000 levels.Index during current week is seen rebounding from the lower band of the last five weeks range placed around 58700-59000. Going ahead a follow through strength above Wednesday’s high (59,796) will open upside towards the recent all time high of 60,430 levels in the coming week. Overall, we expect the index to extend the consolidation within the 58,700–60,400 range. A decisive breakout above this range or a breakdown below it will provide clarity on the next directional move.The key short-term support zone lies at 59,000–58,700. This area is significant as it represents a confluence of the 50-day EMA and the previous month’s low, making it a crucial level to watch.The stock is rebounding taking support at the previous major breakout area signaling a change of polarity thus offers fresh entry opportunity.On the downside key support is placed at 295-293 levels being the confluence of the recent breakout area and 100 days EMA.We expect the stock to head towards 335 levels being the recent high of October 2025. TheBuying demand emerging from the key support area of 750-760 being the recent trendline breakout area and 50 days EMA thus offers fresh entry opportunity.We expect the stock to head higher towards 845 levels being the 161.8% external retracement of the previous breather (812-761).On the lower side key support is placed at 735-740 levels being the confluence of the 100 days EMA and the recent breakout area.","Nifty is currently consolidating near its 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) The index traded with heightened volatility and formed a bearish candle during Wednesday’s session, marking a lower high and lower low.

India, Italy Deepen Ties With Joint Initiative Against Terror Financing: EAM

NEW DELHI: Ambassador of Italy to India, Antonio Bartoli, emphasised the ""reliable"" partnership between Rome and New Delhi and said it will be further enhanced by the conclusion of the European Union-Indian Free Trade Agreement.Speaking with ANI, Antonio Bartoli said Europe provides many advantages in the current era of ""geopolitical turmoil.""""In an era of geopolitical turmoil where unpredictability seems to be the only predictable feature, Europe provides many advantages. It is a vibrant economy with an ancient culture and a rich civilisation like India's...Within this friendship (between Europe and India), Italy is one of the most interesting and reliable partners, and we can develop a lot together. This will be even more enhanced by the conclusion of the FTA,"" he said.This comes ahead of the European Council President, Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who will visit India to represent the EU at the 16th EU-India Summit, scheduled for January 27.The FTA aims to boost bilateral trade between India and the EU, which is already India's largest trading partner, with goods trade totalling $136.53 billion in 2024-25.The agreement is expected to cover areas such as market access for goods, rules of origin, services, investment, and intellectual property rights.India is seeking zero-duty access for labour-intensive sectors like textiles, leather, and handicrafts. The agreement will include safeguards for farmers and Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The FTA will promote regulatory cooperation and transparency, making it easier for businesses to operate in both markets.Reflecting on the India-Italy relationship, Antonio Bartoli said, ""The two Prime Ministers adopted a roadmap, a joint strategic action plan covering five years, 2025 to 2029 and they identified main areas of cooperation. Trade and investment aim to raise the volume to at least 20 billion euros.""""Investments in defence, space, connectivity, IMEC and the Indo-Mediterranean corridor.

Brazil's Lula hails historic EU-Mercosur deal ahead of no-show at its signing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/brazils-lula-hails-historic-eu-mercosur-deal-ahead-of-no-show-at-its-signing/articleshow/126600821.cms,"AP image

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday celebrated the expected signing of the free trade agreement between the EU and four South American countries the following day at a ceremony that Lula will not attend.This is the first major trade agreement for Mercosur, which includes the region's two biggest economies, Brazil and Argentina, along with Paraguay and Uruguay. The two blocs are expected to formally sign their quarter-century-in-the-making trade pact this Saturday at a ceremony in Paraguay. Bolivia, the newest Mercosur member, was not involved in negotiations but can join the agreement in the coming years.While local media reported that Argentina's Javier Milei and Uruguay's Yamandu Orsi will be present at the ceremony hosted by Paraguay's Santiago Pena, Lula decided not to make the trip to the capital Asuncion.Instead, the Brazilian leader will be represented by Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira.That caused some surprise, in light of Lula's energetic efforts in favor of the deal, particularly since returning to Brazil's presidency in 2023 for a third, nonconsecutive term.Lula's December disappointment Experts say the move may hint at Lula's disappointment the deal was not signed in December, when Brazil had the rotating presidency of Mercosur.In Rio, Lula again pointed to how long the negotiations had taken.""It was more than 25 years of suffering and attempts to get a deal,"" Lula said during a short statement to the press at Itamaraty Palace in downtown Rio alongside von der Leyen.But he hailed the historic nature of the pact.""Tomorrow in Asuncion, we will make history by creating one of the world's largest free trade areas, bringing together some 720 million people and a GDP of over $22 trillion,"" he said.The European Commission's president paid warm tribute to Lula for his efforts in making the deal happen.""The political leadership, the personal commitment and passion that you have shown in the last weeks and months, dear Lula, are truly second to none,"" said von der Leyen.At a late press conference in Copacabana on Friday, European Council President Antonio Costa also said that the latest Brazilian presidency of Mercosur was crucial to advance negotiations, paving the way to its signature in Paraguay.""Power of friendship"" The significance of creating one of the world's largest free-trade zones while U.S. President Donald Trump yanks the United States out of the international economy is not lost on the signatories.""This is the power of partnership and openness. This is the power of friendship and understanding between peoples and regions across oceans,"" von der Leyen said. ""And this is how we create real prosperity - prosperity that is shared. Because, we agree, that international trade is not a zero-sum game.""The victory for the EU and Mercosur comes at the expense of the U.S. and China, experts say, as Trump aggressively asserts American authority in the resource-rich region and Beijing uses its massive trade and loans to build influence.The accord grants South American nations, renowned for their fertile land and skilled farmers, increased access at a preferential tax rate to Europe's vast market for agricultural goods.Apex, a Brazilian government investment agency, estimates that EU-bound agricultural exports like instant coffee, poultry and orange juice will rake in $7 billion in coming years.But Lula on Friday warned that Mercosur would not limit itself to the ""eternal role"" of commodity exporters. ""We want to produce and sell industrial goods with higher added value,"" he said.Flavia Loss, an international relations professor at Foundation School of Sociology and Politics in Sao Paulo, said that Lula's absence on Saturday may be retaliation for the delay - another sign that Brazil and Mercosur are seeking equal terms with the EU.""I see Lula's absence as signaling: 'The deal is important but we're not going to change everything for them,'"" Loss said.Rebuke of MAGA logic While the deal is asymmetrical and economically favorable to the European Union, politically the agreement is beneficial for both parties, said Roberto Goulart Menezes, an international relations professor at the University of Brasilia.For the European Union, which is under pressure amid Trump's threats to seize control of Greenland, the deal shows that the group of countries is betting on the diversification of its partners and multilateralism, Goulart said, in a symbolic rebuke of Trump's MAGA logic.""And for Mercosur, it illustrates that the bloc is relevant, despite accusations of being insignificant and on its last legs.""Speaking to journalists, Costa addressed criticisms that the deal favors the EU. ""It's a trade deal, but it's also an investment agreement. (...) Because our policy is not, unlike the Chinese approach, to simply arrive and extract the minerals so that the added value is generated elsewhere.""""There is no longer that post-colonial logic of going around extracting natural resources,"" he said.","Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen celebrate the expected signing of the free trade agreement.

MUMBAI: RBI is stepping up efforts to promote internationalisation of the Indian rupee by amending foreign trade rules to allow exporters more time to realise export proceeds when transactions are invoiced and settled in rupees, signalling a clear policy preference for Indian rupee-denominated trade.Under the revised 2026 regulations, exporters invoicing in foreign currency will continue to have up to 15 months to realise export proceeds, but those billing and settling transactions in Indian rupees will be allowed a realisation period of 18 months. The differentiated timeline is aimed at enabling Indian exporters to offer more flexible credit terms to overseas buyers if they agree to transact in rupees, thereby encouraging wider global use of the currency.

January 26, 2026:

January brings with it a series of festivals and events, and many are wondering whether January 15 is a bank holiday or not. It is therefore advisable to check the bank holiday calendar if a branch visit is on your to-do list.Missing a holiday can quickly turn a simple bank errand into a wasted trip, especially in the early days of the year as people settle back into work and manage their finances. In India, banks observe a combination of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can vary from state to state.Banks in many states will remain closed today, on January 15, 2026.Banks in Maharashtra will remain closed due to the election to Municipal Corporations in the state.FBanks in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh will also remain closed on the occasion of Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal , Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be closed to mark Thiruvalluvar Day and Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks nationwide will be closed on account of Republic Day.In addition to these, banks across the country remain closed on the second and fourth Saturdays of every month.Being aware of bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute inconvenience. While branch services are unavailable on holidays, customers can still access online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical branch visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available. Account holders are advised to plan such activities ahead of time and make use of digital banking options during closures.","Banks in many states will remain closed today, on January 15, 2026.

US President Donald Trump, during a health roundtable at the White House, suggested that the countries that don't go along with his Greenland plan may face tariffs.""I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,"" he said.While the tariff threats are fresh to the matter, his remarks come amid the renewed push to purchase the self-governed territory that is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.

This came as Trump pushed the Nato to support his decision to acquire Greenland.After the meeting, Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said Copenhagen and the White House still have a “fundamental disagreement” over Greenland.However, the meeting did conclude with an agreement to form a working group, though Denmark and the White House publicly gave sharply different explanations of its purpose.A week ago, he claimed that if the US does not step in, then Russia or China will try to acquire the strategically located Arctic territory.Reinstating the claims, he said he would not want Beijing or Moscow to become neighbours to the United States.Speaking to reporters during a meeting with top oil and gas executives, he said, ""We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland -- and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbour. I would like to make a deal the easy way, but if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way""Greenland and Denmark have made their stance clear about ""Greenland not being for sale.""

Taiwanese companies will specifically invest $250 billion in sectors such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and energy. The deal also exempts certain imports from tariffs, including generic pharmaceuticals and aircraft components, while Taiwanese semiconductor firms investing in the US will receive favourable tariff treatments.Beijing had already criticised the arrangement before its announcement, calling it “an economic plunder” by the US on Taiwan.","The United States and Taiwan finalised a trade deal on Thursday, lowering tariffs on Taiwanese goods in exchange for $250 billion in new investments in the US technology sector.

The company reported a net profit for the fourth quarter that exceeded market expectations, signalling continued demand for AI-driven technologies.Meanwhile, oil prices remained steady as geopolitical tensions appeared to ease. The United States said on Thursday that Iran had stopped 800 executions of protesters following pressure from Trump, after Gulf allies reportedly discouraged military action in response to Tehran’s crackdown on demonstrations.Precious metals also found some stability amid the calmer backdrop.

US tariffs no bar: China’s trade surplus hits $1.2 trillion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tariffs-no-bar-chinas-trade-surplus-hits-1-2-trillion/articleshow/126536714.cms,"Bloomberg

China’s exports ended last year with a growth spurt and sent its trade surplus to a record $1.2 trillion in 2025, extending a boom that’s seen factories escape Donald Trump’s tariffs by making deeper inroads into markets beyond the US.The resilience was the biggest surprise for an ailing Chinese economy and could cushion it in the months to come. Defying expectations for a slowdown, exports picked up last month — a feat given a high base of comparison from a year ago, when Trump’s re-election to the presidency sparked panicked front-loading of orders.The 6.6% gain in Dec was the quickest in three months, official data showed on Wednesday, and faster than any forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.“We expect export resilience to extend into this year, with exports remaining an important growth driver and partially offsetting weaker domestic demand,” Barclays economists wrote in a report.The combined increase in shipments to Southeast Asia and Europe more than offset a deepening contraction in sales to the US last year.A surge in exports of highend goods shows the headway China has made in moving up the value chain, which also led to its shrinking imports for products like cars.And as supply chains shift overseas, the construction of factories elsewhere — partly driven by Chinese investment — is pushing up demand for Chinese components, equipment and machinery. The factors driving China’s booming trade and large surpluses are unlikely to fade soon.The country’s current account surplus — a measure of trade in goods and services — was projected by the International Monetary Fund at 3.3% of gross domestic product last year. That would be the highest level since 2010, when the country’s last great export upswing was tapering off following its ascension into the World Trade Organization in the early 2000s.The swelling trade surplus also underscores the imbalance between China’s manufacturing strength and stubbornly weak domestic consumption. It’s a vulnerability likely to persist into this year and beyond.While exports have powered the world’s second-biggest economy, its years-long property slump and falling investment are restraining the country’s appetite for foreign goods, reducing imports such as crude oil. Deflation at home also led to depreciation of the yuan in inflation-adjusted terms, making Chinese products more appealing elsewhere. But as China navigates tariffs and growing economic protectionism around the world, it’s stirring anxiety abroad as it pours exports into Africa, Latin America and beyond.Chinese authorities are taking steps to address the rising trade tensions, including by reducing export tax rebates for hundreds of products such as solar cells and batteries. In another sign of easing frictions, the European Union is considering a minimum price system for Chinese electric vehicles to replace import tariffs. As exports surge ever higher, the domestic implications are also far-reaching. The strength of external demand will likely weaken urgency for Chinese policymakers to boost domestic consumer spending and investment.",China's exports ended last year with a growth spurt and sent its trade surplus to a record $1.2 trillion in 2025.

‘US Is Screwed If…’: Trump Fears Supreme Court Ruling As Tariff Empire Faces Trillions In Losses

Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump

The US Supreme Court on Wednesday issued three decisions but did not deliver a verdict on the closely watched legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s global tariffs, keeping markets and governments waiting for clarity on a case with wide economic implications.As per news agency Reuters, the court did not indicate when it would rule on the tariffs dispute and, as is customary, did not announce in advance which cases would be decided on the day.The latest decision day marked the second missed opportunity for a ruling, following another session that passed without a verdict.The case is seen as a major test of presidential powers and the Supreme Court’s willingness to scrutinise Trump’s expansive claims of authority since returning to office in January 2025, reported Reuters.The outcome is expected to have a significant impact on global trade and the wider economy.At the centre of the dispute is Trump’s use of a 1977 law — the International Emergency Economic Powers Act — to impose sweeping tariffs on trade partners by declaring various national emergencies.During arguments heard in early November, both conservative and liberal justices appeared sceptical about whether the law actually authorises the imposition of tariffs, according to Reuters.The Trump administration is appealing lower court rulings that found the president had exceeded his authority.The case, formally titled, is being closely followed by businesses that have challenged the tariffs in court. As per Yahoo Finance, companies such as Costco are seeking refunds on import duties if the Supreme Court ultimately rules against the president’s actions.Trump has publicly voiced strong concerns about the potential outcome. On Monday, he wrote on social media: “If the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE’RE SCREWED!”His comments followed weeks of online posts warning that losing the power to impose tariffs would be a serious blow to the country.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters that even if the court were to strike down the tariffs — an outcome he described as unlikely — the Treasury has sufficient funds to cover any refunds.However, he questioned whether companies would pass that money back to consumers. “It won’t be a problem if we have to do it,” Bessent said, adding that businesses suing the government may not share refunds with customers.The delay comes amid broader global trade tensions. Yahoo Finance noted that China recorded a record $1.2 trillion trade surplus in 2025 despite Trump’s tariffs, with Beijing blaming the US for growing global trade imbalances.The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in the tariffs case before the end of its current session in June. Until then, uncertainty remains over the future of Trump’s tariff regime and the scope of presidential power over trade.","The US Supreme Court on Wednesday issued three decisions but did not deliver a verdict on the closely watched legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s global tariffs.

NEW DELHI: The United States has decided to freeze immigrant visa processing indefinitely for citizens of 75 countries, including Pankistan, Iran, Russia, Somalia and Afghanistan, in what is being described as one of the Trump administration’s most far-reaching immigration enforcement measures.The US State Department will suspend the immigrant visa processing beginning January 21 while it reassesses screening and vetting procedures, a person familiar with the matter said. The individual spoke on condition of anonymity as the internal department memo has not been made public.According to the memo, consular officers have been instructed to refuse visas under existing law as part of a broader effort to tighten enforcement of the “public charge” provision of US immigration law. The move is aimed at denying entry to applicants deemed likely to rely on public welfare benefits.The list of affected countries includes Pakistan, Somalia, Russia, Afghanistan, Brazil, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Nigeria, Thailand and Yemen, among others. While applicants from some of these countries already face significant hurdles in obtaining US visas, the decision is expected to come as a shock to nationals from others, including Brazil.Also read: US freezes immigrant visa processing for 75 countries: Is India, Pakistan in the list? Check the complete details The pause will remain in effect indefinitely until the State Department completes its reassessment of visa processing procedures, the report said.Somalia has drawn particular scrutiny following a major fraud investigation in Minnesota, where prosecutors uncovered widespread abuse of taxpayer-funded benefit programmes. Federal officials said many of those implicated were Somali nationals or Somali-Americans.In November 2025, the State Department sent a cable to US diplomatic posts worldwide directing consular officers to apply stricter screening standards under the public charge provision. The guidance instructs officers to deny visas to applicants considered likely to depend on public benefits, taking into account factors such as health, age, English proficiency, financial status and the potential need for long-term medical care.Under the guidance, older or overweight applicants could be denied visas, as could individuals with any past use of government cash assistance or institutional care.In a statement, State Department spokesperson Tommy Piggott said, “The State Department will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people.”“Immigration from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits,” he added.The public charge provision has existed in US immigration law for decades, though enforcement has varied widely across administrations, with consular officers traditionally given broad discretion in applying the standard.Exceptions to the visa pause will be “very limited” and will only be granted after applicants have cleared public charge considerations, according to the report.Under a 2022 version of the public charge rule implemented during the Biden administration, the scope of benefits considered was narrowed mainly to cash assistance and long-term institutional care. Programmes such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Women, Infants and Children nutrition programme, Medicaid and housing vouchers were excluded.The Immigration and Nationality Act has long allowed consular officers to deny visas on public charge grounds. In 2019, President Donald Trump expanded the definition to include a broader range of public benefits. That move was challenged in court, with parts of it blocked before being rescinded by the Biden administration.","The US State Department will suspend the immigrant visa processing beginning January 21 while it reassesses screening and vetting procedures.

US stock markets edged lower again on Wednesday as mixed earnings from major banks and a rise in oil and gold prices kept investors cautious. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 per cent, extending its decline a day after hitting an all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 84 points, or 0.2 per cent, while the Nasdaq composite was down 0.5 per cent in early trade, AP reported.Market sentiment remained fragile as crude oil prices added about 1 per cent to recent gains amid concerns that protests in Iran could disrupt global oil supplies. Gold rose nearly 1 per cent, moving closer to record levels, while Treasury yields eased as investors sought safer assets.Bank stocks weighed on the benchmarks. Wells Fargo dropped 4.5 per cent after reporting quarterly profit and revenue that missed expectations, with analysts pointing to weaker trading fees and other items. Bank of America slid 3.4 per cent despite posting stronger-than-expected profits, while Citigroup pared early gains to trade 0.3 per cent lower after its results fell short of forecasts.With equity valuations elevated, analysts said companies need to deliver solid earnings growth to justify current price levels.Consensus estimates tracked by FactSet suggest earnings per share for S&P 500 companies in the final quarter of 2025 are expected to be about 8 per cent higher than a year earlier.Energy stocks offered some support. Exxon Mobil rose 1.3 per cent, helping limit broader market losses, as US benchmark crude gained 0.8 per cent, taking its year-to-date increase to 7 per cent.In the bond market, yields edged lower following mixed economic signals. Data showed US retail spending in November exceeded expectations, a positive sign for consumer demand, though economists flagged underlying weaknesses. “Sales of big-ticket items fell from the prior year,” Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management, said.Another report showed US wholesale prices rose modestly in November, following data earlier this week that indicated consumer inflation remained above the Federal Reserve’s 2 per cent target but broadly met expectations.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury slipped to 4.15 per cent from 4.18 per cent on Tuesday, while the two-year yield eased to 3.52 per cent.Overseas markets were mixed. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5 per cent to a fresh record amid expectations that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may call early elections. In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.6 per cent, while Shanghai’s index fell 0.3 per cent after data showed China’s trade surplus surged 20 per cent in 2025 despite US tariffs.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 per cent, extending its decline a day after hitting an all-time high.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

No clarity in will: Arbitrator could take important call on future of Tata’s fortune,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-clarity-in-will-arbitrator-could-take-important-call-on-future-of-tatas-fortune/articleshow/117938544.cms,"In 2022, Ratan Tata established two entities to manage his personal wealth: the RTEF under Section 8 of the Companies Act 2013 and the Ratan Tata Endowment Trust.

Laying the foundation

In light of uncertainty regarding trustee appointments to the Ratan Tata Endowment Foundation ( RTEF ), Tata stakeholders are considering opting for an arbitrator. A retired Supreme Court chief justice is likely to be approached to determine whether the authority to appoint trustees rests with Ratan Tata's will executors, the Tata family, or Tata Trusts members, according to sources close to the matter.In 2022, Ratan Tata established two entities to manage his personal wealth: the RTEF under Section 8 of the Companies Act 2013 and the Ratan Tata Endowment Trust, both dedicated to charitable and philanthropic endeavours.His direct ownership in Tata Sons , the group's holding company, stood at 0.83%, with a net worth of Rs 7,900 crore according to the Hurun India Rich List of August 2024. The RTEF additionally holds minor stakes in Tata Digital and Tata Technologies.Sources told ET that his wealth exceeds Rs 15,000 crore. Officials familiar with the situation confirm Ratan Tata intended the foundation to operate independently from Tata Trusts, which holds a 66% stake in Tata Sons.His vision included allocating a substantial portion of his wealth towards charitable causes. The foundation is expected to manage the majority of his assets, whilst the trust oversees the remaining portion.His personal vehicle collection, including a Ferrari and Maserati, may be sold at auction with proceeds directed to the foundation. During his lifetime, Ratan Tata appointed RR Shastri and Burjis Taraporewala as RTEF holding trustees and Jamsheed Poncha as CEO, whilst expressing his preference for Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran as managing trustee, according to informed sources.The authority for RTEF trustee appointments remains unclear. The will's executors include Darius Khambata, Mehli Mistry, and Shireen and Deanna Jejeebhoy. Although Khambata serves as senior counsel and will executor, stakeholders may need guidance from a more senior legal expert. The Jejeebhoys are Ratan Tata's half-sisters, whilst Mistry, a close associate, serves as board trustee for the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust.Following the execution of probate, the foundation will receive substantial funding through Ratan Tata's holdings in Tata Sons and associated group companies.Rata, Tata envisioned RTEF's mission to address novel and underserved philanthropic areas, advance research in contemporary technologies for modern India, and support enduring initiatives aimed at creating meaningful social impact across the country. The foundation operates under board management, adhering to its charitable objectives.According to Ajay Khatlawala, managing partner at Little & Co., executors typically manage the deceased's estate as per their wishes when specific instructions are not provided in the will.""However, as RTEF is a company incorporated under Section 8 of the Companies Act 2013, it will be governed by the provisions of its Memorandum of Association, Articles of Association and the provisions of the Companies Act,"" said Khatlawala. ""The issue of appointment of trustees or directors of RTEF will therefore be governed by the provisions contained in its Articles of Association.""Khatlawala noted that this situation could establish a benchmark for legacy foundation governance in India.""It will affirm the need and importance of clear, written instructions in the will to avoid disputes and ambiguity amongst stakeholders after the passing away of the founder,"" Khatlawala added.Regarding private trusts, Shrenik Gandhi, managing partner at Chambers of Shrenik Gandhi, explained that under the Indian Trust Act, 1882, trustees accept the trust author's confidence. ""The author of the trust may provide for the roles, responsibilities and powers of the trustees and may also appoint a person as a 'managing trustee' or 'holding trustee' with certain additional powers,"" said Gandhi. ""If the instrument of trust grants powers to any trustee to appoint anyone at a key position in the trust, such power may be exercised. However, the ultimate responsibility of the trustee is to realise, and protect the benefit of the trust property.""","Ratan Tata established two entities to manage his personal wealth: the RTEF under Section 8 of the Companies Act 2013 and the Ratan Tata Endowment Trust.

Budget 2025: Rent a home or buy one? That’s a yuge dilemma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2025-rent-a-home-or-buy-one-thats-a-yuge-dilemma/articleshow/117857317.cms,"Representative image

Pros:

Cons:

Is it better to stay on rent or get your own place? It’s complicated, to borrow a phrase from romantic conundrums. So, should one spend a big sum on a house property – especially with the help of a home loan – given that prices are higher and the capital appreciation in many towns is not as significant as it once was? Isn’t living on rent, perhaps closer to the office, easier? On the other hand, an investment in a house property is a secured and tangible investment. Plus, a house is not just four walls; there is a lot of emotion attached to it. Let’s look at it from the tax perspective…One of the biggest advantages of renting a house from a tax perspective is the exemption for house rent allowance (HRA), a tax-efficient salary component. If HRA is not a part of your salary package — for example if you are self-employed or a consultant— you can avail deduction of up to 5,000 a month from gross taxableincome, under the old tax regime. The HRA exemption is not available to taxpayers who opt for the new tax regime. The exemption is on the lowest of the following:● Rent paid less 10% of salary (basic salary and dearness allowance)● 50% of salary if the house is in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata or Chennai, or 40% of salary in other cities● Actual HRA received● Rent may be lower than a home loan EMI● More choice of location and type● Easy to relocate to another area of city● Tax benefits are available (under old tax regime)● Rent, however high, does not go towards creating an asset● Rents usually increase every year, leading to higher cash outflow● No or limited scope of making structural changes● One may have to vacate on short noticeTax benefits are only available under the old tax regime. If you take a home loan to buy a house property, the EMI is typically made up of two parts: one part goes towards the principal (the amount you took as loan) and the other towards the interest (the cost of servicing the loan).Deduction is available under the overall 1.5 lakh limit under Section 80C under the old tax regime. Principal repayment, stamp duty, registration fee and other expenses related to transfer of the house property qualify for the deduction, under this limit.Three situations apply: the house is self-occupied, vacant or rented out. For a self-occupied house property, there is deduction available on the interest paid on home loan up to 2 lakh per annum under the old tax regime. This can be set off against any other income. The same rules apply even if the house is vacant. If you have rented out the house, you can claim deduction for not only the interest paid on the home loan, but also municipal taxes paid and a standard deduction of 30% of the rental income.If your house is a self-occupied property bought using a home loan, it means you do not earn any rental income from it. Therefore, interest paid on the home loan will result in a loss. Total loss up to 2 lakh from house property (either self-occupied or letout) can be adjusted in a financial year against any other head of income (such as salary or income from other sources). Loss exceeding 2 lakh can be carried forward for eight subsequent assessment years but can be setoff only against ‘Income from house property’.The concept of notional rent applies when an individual owns three houses or more. In such cases, two house properties are considered self-occupied (without any conditions as per the 2025 Budget proposals) and the remaining are treated as ‘deemed let-out’, thus attracting notional rent. This is based on the expected market rent and becomes a taxable income.● A house is an asset and EMIs go towards creating this asset● Substantial tax benefits on home loans● Heavy upfront costs such as down payment and registration, followed by property taxes and repairs● House properties are illiquid as they cannot be sold quickly● Property prices see fluctuations and may not fetch expected returns● EMIs have to be paid regularly, mostly irrespective of situations like loss of income","One of the biggest advantages of renting a house from a tax perspective is the exemption for house rent allowance (HRA), a tax-efficient salary component. If HRA is not a part of your salary package, you can avail deduction of up to 5,000 a month from gross taxableincome.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117857373,imgsize-147566,width-400,resizemode-4/117857373.jpg"

Budget 2025 tightens tax rules for NRIs: What Indian students and professionals abroad must brace for,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/budget-2025-tightens-tax-rules-for-nris-what-indian-students-and-professionals-abroad-must-brace-for/articleshow/117824889.cms,"Indian Students Abroad Face New Tax Scrutiny Under Budget 2025 Changes. (Representative Image)

Tightening NRI Tax Regulations: What Changes?

Greater scrutiny of foreign-earned income: Indian authorities will now have enhanced data-sharing agreements with multiple jurisdictions, especially with countries that are part of India’s Double Tax Avoidance Agreements (DTAA). This means Indian students who take up jobs abroad may need to declare their foreign earnings in India, even if they have no active income sources in the country.

Expanded residency definition for taxation: Previously, NRIs were taxed on their Indian-sourced income only if they spent over 182 days in India within a financial year. However, earlier reforms in Budget 2020 reduced this to 120 days for high-income individuals. Budget 2025 hints at further tightening, making it more difficult for students and professionals to maintain NRI status if they have substantial financial ties to India.

Potential impact on tax treaty benefits: While India maintains DTAA treaties with countries like the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, the government has indicated its intent to rework these agreements to close loopholes exploited for tax avoidance. This could mean increased withholding tax rates on foreign remittances or stricter documentation requirements for those claiming tax relief under DTAA.

What This Means for Students and Professionals Abroad



Increased reporting requirements

Complexity in financial transfers

Higher tax liabilities for returning NRIs

Should Students Worry About This?



The Bottom Line: A More Complicated Financial Future for NRIs



The Union Budget 2025 , while focused on accelerating domestic growth and fiscal consolidation, also signals a more stringent tax regime for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), including students and young professionals abroad. As the government moves to strengthen regulatory oversight and clamp down on tax evasion, individuals with overseas earnings now face tighter scrutiny and expanded reporting requirements. These reforms, positioned as part of India’s broader alignment with international tax norms, introduce new layers of financial complexity for those balancing obligations between their host country and India.Indian students planning to stay abroad post-graduation, whether through work permits, permanent residency, or citizenship, are now facing new challenges following recent changes. Historically, India's tax policies have been relatively lenient for students and young professionals overseas, but the Budget 2025 introduces stricter compliance regulations. While the government's focus on fiscal transparency aligns with global standards, it could impose a substantial reporting burden on young professionals juggling financial obligations across multiple countries.The budget proposes stricter monitoring of income earned abroad by NRIs through amendments in tax treaties and compliance rules. Some of the key changes include:For students who remain in the US, UK, Canada, or Australia on post-study work visas, these regulatory shifts mean higher tax-related obligations and potential double taxation risks if they don’t structure their finances carefully. Some implications include:Indian tax authorities will likely demand detailed disclosures on overseas earnings, investments, and bank accounts. Failing to report these correctly could result in penalties or potential legal action under anti-tax evasion laws.If students or professionals continue sending money to India—for family support, investments, or savings—they might face stricter tax scrutiny. Transactions through the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) may attract compliance checks, particularly for individuals transferring large sums back to Indian accounts.Many students consider returning to India after a few years abroad. However, if their foreign assets (such as savings, stocks, or property investments) are not declared properly, they could be taxed upon repatriation. The Foreign Asset Disclosure Rule under the Black Money Act may also apply, which imposes severe penalties for non-disclosure.While these changes may not immediately impact students, they will become critical for those who transition into long-term residency or citizenship abroad while maintaining financial ties to India. Students seeking permanent residency in countries like Canada and Australia, or H1B sponsorships in the US, must now be more diligent in structuring their tax status.For those who plan to return to India later in their careers, early tax planning—including declaring foreign assets and ensuring proper documentation of earnings—will be crucial to avoid tax disputes.India’s growing scrutiny of offshore income is part of a global push for tax transparency, aligning with initiatives like the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (CRS). While this helps curb tax evasion, it adds layers of compliance for NRIs—including students and young professionals—who must now navigate a tighter regulatory web when managing their earnings abroad.","The Union Budget 2025 signals a more stringent tax regime for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), including students and young professionals abroad.

NEW DELHI: After giving major tax relief to middle class salaried individuals in Union Budget 2025 , finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the significant tax relief provided by the Modi government has put more more money in people's hands compared to the tax structure in 2014 under the previous Congress-led government. The reforms, aimed at putting more money back into taxpayers' hands, have resulted in substantial savings across different income brackets, Sitharaman said.""If you compare what we have done today with what was done in 2014 under the Congress government, the change in rates has also benefited people earning Rs 24 lakh.

The government feels that on the average Rs 1 lakh per month (income), you need not pay tax.""Speaking on the changes, officials emphasised that middle-class and higher-income earners alike are benefitting from the lower tax rates and increased rebates. The government provided a comparative breakdown:The government stressed that the benefits extend beyond just those earning up to Rs 12 lakh, where tax rebates have been introduced.Even those earning Rs 24 lakh per year will see a reduction in their tax liability, ensuring a more progressive and taxpayer-friendly system.Additionally, the Finance Ministry provided a comparison with the prevailing 2024 tax rates and the newly proposed structure:Finance Secretary emphasised that these tax cuts represent a ""substantial amount being put back into the hands of people who deserve it."" He also noted that not only have rebates been introduced, but the overall tax rates have been lowered, benefiting a broader segment of taxpayers.With these changes, the government has reinforced its commitment to reducing the tax burden, boosting disposable income, and supporting economic growth, ensuring that taxpayers retain a greater share of their earnings.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the significant tax relief provided by the Modi government has put more more money in people's hands.

How will a person who has an income Rs 12 lakh benefit from new rates?

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat. India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.In the proposed new tax regime, the maximum total income for which tax liability for individual taxpayers is NIL is Rs. 12 lakhs.The benefit of such Nil tax liability mentioned above is available only in the new tax regime. This New tax regime is the default regime. To avail the benefit of rebate allowable under proposed provisions of new tax regime, only return is to be filed otherwise no other step is required to be taken.Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs 12 lakh. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime.

Goldman Sachs has a ‘sell’ call on Asian Paints with a target price of Rs 2,275. Analysts said October-December quarter was below estimates, as EBITDA and margins declined, driven by negative operational leverage impacted by increase in staff costs. The paints major’s revenue decline worsened, driven by deteriorating mix. They feel near term demand likely to remain subdued and it has to withstand the impact of increased competitive intensity.HSBC has a ‘buy’ recommendation on Godrej Properties with a target price of Rs 3,700 (+61%). The real estate major’s Oct-Dec pre-sales were below estimates due to some missed launches but the company remains confident of meeting its FY25 guidance. Analysts expect an upcycle driven by strong margins and higher bookings.CLSA has an ‘outperform’ recommendation Indraprastha Gas with a target price of Rs 220 (+7%). Analysts said that the company has not increased CNG prices in Delhi for over three months while its peers MGL and Gujarat Gas have already raised prices by 2-4%. After the Delhi elections, now the window opens up for IGL to raise CNG prices by 4%. This may limit any impact on IGL’s volume growth.Jefferies on has maintained its ‘buy’ recommendation on Gateway Distriparks but with a target price of Rs 100 (+32%) from Rs 110 earlier. Analysts said that industry volume growth was weak during the Oct-Dec quarter. They expect the company’s EBITDA could rise 5-20% over FY25-27. They also believe rail container volume growth will revert from the next quarter.Morgan Stanley has an ‘overweight’ recommendation on Titan with a target price of Rs 3,876 (+11%).

""I think India should be one of the leaders of the AI revolution. It's really quite amazing to see what the country has done in embracing technology and building the entire stack,"" he said during a fireside chat with IT & electronics minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.""India is an incredibly important market for AI in general, (and) for OpenAI in particular. It's our second biggest market. We tripled our users here last year.""He said India has a high degree of creativity, and should be a ""leader"" when it comes to developing reasoning models at efficient costs.Ashwini Vaishnaw - while talking about the work under the India AI Mission and the need for developing local foundation models keeping India's context, languages, cultural and regional nuances in mind - said the country has the capability to do cutting-edge work but at a fraction of costs being incurred by US companies.""Our young entrepreneurs, our startups, our researchers, they are really, really focused on getting to that next level of innovation which will reduce the cost. Our country sent a mission to the Moon at a fraction of the cost that many other countries spent. Right. Why can't we do a (AI) model which will be a fraction of the cost that many other countries do? So yes, innovation will bring that cost down. We think that kind of thing will come out in this process,"" the minister said to an audience that included startup founders and those engaged in the field of AI.Altman agreed that cost for a given unit of intelligence seems to have fallen by about 10x in the last one year. ""What's happening with the reduction in cost of AI models is extraordinary.""The OpenAI founder, however, said that while certain costs around AI development have come down, training of models and doing frontier research on projects such as Stargate will still continue to be expensive.""To stay at the frontier, we believe those costs will continue to rise on this exponential curve. But also the returns to increase in intelligence are exponential in terms of the economic value, (and) the scientific value that you can create.""","OpenAI founder Sam Altman says India should be one of the leaders of the AI revolution.

RBI set to end longest rate pause,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-set-to-end-longest-rate-pause/articleshow/117962535.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI's monetary policy committee began its meeting on Wed and is expected to end its longest pause with a rate cut on Friday, the first in nearly five years.The last rate cut was in May 2020 when RBI lowered the repo rate to 4% to support the economy during the Covid-induced lockdown. It later raised rates seven times to 6.5% due to inflation amid the Ukraine war, supply chain disruptions, and global price surges. The pause has remained since Feb 2023.Most economists expect a 25bps cut, but some believe it would be premature if US President Donald Trump escalates tariff threats, worsening financial market volatility. Lower interest rates could also pressure the rupee, making US debt more attractive for foreign investors.Dipanwita Mazumdar , an economist at Bank of Baroda , said risks to growth from uncertainty, highlighted in the IMF's latest report, could prompt RBI to start cutting rates. ""For other economies, rate cuts began earlier, giving them room for a 'wait and watch' approach,"" she said. ""Balancing macro and geopolitical factors, we believe there is space for a 25bps rate cut.""The policy meeting includes two new RBI members - governor Sanjay Malhotra and deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao - who will be attending the meeting for the first time in place of their predecessors Shaktikanta Das and Michael Patra, respectively. Malhotra recently announced liquidity measures injecting Rs 1.5 lakh crore, seen as paving the way for rate transmission. A liquidity deficit could keep borrowing costs high even if RBI cuts rates.

The companies were responding to an earlier Nikkei newspaper report that said Nissan will pull out of an agreement with Honda because the two sides are unable to agree on terms.A collapse of the discussion would spell trouble for Nissan, which was counting on its Japanese peer for a lifeline.

Shares in France's Renault, Nissan's biggest shareholder, fell as much as 3.4% in Paris. Honda and Nissan reiterated that they plan to make an announcement about their future around mid-Feb. The companies had already postponed plans to offer an update on the direction of their potential integration by the end of last month.Friction emerged this week after several media outlets reported that Honda had floated the idea of acquiring Nissan and making it a subsidiary. That proposal was a departure from plans made public on Dec 23 to establish a joint holding company and was met with strong opposition within Nissan. bloomberg","Honda shares rose 8.2% on Wednesday, while Nissan slumped 4.9% before the Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading due to the Nikkei report.

Trump’s crypto policies



Cryptocurrency prices fell after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. Bitcoin dropped from around $105,000 on Saturday to about $92,000 on Sunday night. However, it later recovered to over $100,000 on Monday after Trump paused tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods.While bitcoin showed some recovery, other cryptocurrencies saw larger losses. Ethereum , dogecoin, and other digital assets declined sharply. Trump’s own meme coin traded at around $19 on Monday, about 75 per cent below its peak when he launched it before his second inauguration.“These are riskier cryptos than bitcoin,” Garrick Hileman, a cryptocurrency analyst was quoted as saying by news agency Associated. “But it’s a little surprising how big the gap is.”Financial markets also saw major shifts before the tariffs were set to take effect. Trump warned that Americans might feel “some pain” from the tariffs but said the move was necessary. He also suggested that tariffs on the European Union and possibly the United Kingdom could follow.Bitcoin was created in 2009 as digital cash outside government control. Over the years, it has become more mainstream, with its price movements now closely tied to tech stocks.Meme coins, a more volatile part of the crypto market, have also seen sharp declines. First Lady Melania Trump’s meme coin, launched before Trump took office, is down nearly 90% from its highest value.Trump, who was once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, has now embraced digital assets. He has promised to make the US a leader in crypto and has appointed officials supportive of the industry.Despite recent declines, cryptocurrencies have gained value since Trump’s election. Bitcoin remains close to its record high of $109,000.","Cryptocurrency prices fell after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China.

But the conservative leader may also be seeking favor with Washington, where the Trump administration said Saturday it would impose its own 25% tariffs on Mexico.Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced Monday that the tariffs would be halted for now to give the two sides more time to negotiate. Trump has demanded that Mexico do more to crack down on illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling across the border.Noboa, who took time away from a re-election campaign to attend Trump's inauguration last month in Washington, has hailed Trump's win as a victory for Latin America.Ecuador's announcement comes amid the South American country's separate and bitter diplomatic dispute with Mexico, which last year severed diplomatic ties after Ecuadorian police broke into the Mexican Embassy to arrest Ecuador's former Vice President Jorge Glas.Ecuador's move was widely condemned as a breach of international law, while Ecuador said that Glas was wanted for fraud and not for political reasons and accused Mexico of illegitimately granting him political asylum at the diplomatic compound.Trade between the two countries is minimal, however, accounting for less than 1% of Mexico's total exports, according to Mexican central bank data.Noboa, heir to a banana fortune, is running Sunday in elections for his first complete constitutional term after being elected 18 months ago to finish the aborted mandate of ex-President Guillermo Lasso.","Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa said Monday that the 27% tariff to be applied on Mexican goods was aimed at boosting local manufacturers.

Asian stocks took a hit overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei tumbling 2.8 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng down 1 per cent.However, mainland Chinese markets remain closed until Wednesday due to the Lunar New Year holiday.European markets are bracing for further declines as investors assess the risk of a global trade war . The pound slipped 1 per cent against a stronger US dollar, trading just under $1.23, though it gained 0.4 per cent against the euro, which is also weighed down by the tariff war.Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, told The Mirror, financial markets are likely to react strongly to Trump’s tariff measures. She noted that while the FTSE 100 could be somewhat shielded due to its defensive nature and the absence of immediate UK-specific tariffs, the index still pointed to a 0.8 per cent decline at the start of the week.""This does not mean that the UK economy will avoid impact from the tariffs, but it does mean that the UK economy could be more resilient than elsewhere. It’s too early to know exactly what impact tariffs will have on the global economy, but it is fair to say that they have a high potential of triggering inflation, and weighing heavily on global growth, including the US economy,"" she said.","The blue-chip index fell 105.8 points to 8,568.2 during early trade on Monday.

Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and ether witnessed steep declines on Monday as rising tariff war tensions weakened investor sentiments. During early trade in Asia, Bitcoin fell to $94,476.18, briefly hitting a three-week low of $91,441.89.Ether saw an even steeper drop of 24 per cent, hitting its lowest level since September, to $2,494.33.The downturn extended into Sunday, with bitcoin slipping 7 per cent to $93,768.66, according to Coin Metrics. The CoinDesk 20 index, which tracks the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation, dropped 19 per cent.The selloff follows US President Donald Trump’s announcements of a a 25 per cent levy on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, set to take effect on Tuesday. Given that the US conducts around $1.6 trillion in annual trade with these three nations, the move has heightened fears of an economic slowdown.In retaliation to the levies, Canada and Mexico vowed to impose countermeasures, while China signalled plans to challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organisation.""Crypto is really the only way to express risk over the weekend, and on news like this, crypto resorts to a risk proxy,"" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, told CNBC. The market volatility is expected to weaken economic growth, affect corporate earnings and drive inflation higher.Following Trump's victory in elections, Bitcoin had surged 40 per cent, reaching an all-time high of $107,071.86 on January 20, the day of his inauguration as the 47th US President. Much of this rally was driven by expectations that his administration would introduce crypto-friendly policies, with Trump himself vowing to make the US the ""crypto capital of the planet.""However, despite early optimism, some investors have grown impatient over the lack of concrete regulatory reforms. Last month, Trump ordered the formation of a cryptocurrency working group to explore potential regulations and even consider a national crypto reserve, but rigid policy changes remain absent.Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, believes the ongoing tariff war could ultimately benefit bitcoin in the long run. ""“A sustained tariff war will be amazing for bitcoin in the long run due to an eventual weakening of the dollar and US rates."" he told ET.Analysts are keeping a close eye on the $90,000 support level for bitcoin, warning that a drop below this threshold could trigger a slide towards $80,000.

Further lookout for trade war

US President Donald Trump’s latest trade war proved to be a major blow for Canada, Mexico and China, pushing their currencies to multi-year lows.The greenback recorded a major gain while weighing down Euro to a two year low and injuring the conventional safe haven Swiss frank to its lowest since May.However, two biggest trading partners for the States’ Canada and Mexico, wasted no time in vowing retaliation measures. China also condemned the move, claiming it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization, news agency Reuters reported.Last month after assuming office, Trump had threatened to hit Canada and Mexico with a 25 per cent tariff and while China stood at a levy of 10 per cent, alleging to combat issues like illegal immigration and drug trade.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, gained 0.11 per cent to 109.65 after hitting a three-week high previously in the session.The tariff news also shifted expectations for Federal Reserve policy . Traders scaled back bets on interest rate cuts, pricing in just 41 basis points of easing this year—down from 47 basis points previously.The US dollar climbed 0.7 per cent to 7.2552 yuan in offshore trading, after briefly hitting a record 7.3765 yuan. With Chinese markets closed for Lunar New Year, traders expect further volatility when trading resumes on Wednesday.It jumped 2.7 per cent to 21.40 Mexican pesos, the highest since March 2022.The Canadian dollar weakened 1.4 per cent to C$1.4755 per US dollar, a level last seen in 2003.It plunged 2.3 per cent to $1.0125, a low last recorded in November 2022, before a minor reverse back to $1.0257.It fell 0.74 per cent reaching $1.2304.Though global markets were tumbling down, the Japanese yen held firm at 155.50 per dollar.US economic data released on Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, closely observed by the Federal Reserve—rose 0.3 per cent in the past month, the largest increase since April 2024. This suggests the Fed may be in no rush to resume cutting interest rates.Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies took a hit. Bitcoin slid 4.4 per cent to $97,622, falling back below $100,000 for the first time in nearly three weeks. Ether tumbled 15 per cent to $2,812.8, its lowest level since early November.Donald Trump is expected to discuss the tariffs with Canada and Mexico, arguing that Americans may feel economic ""pain"" from the 25 percent duties but that it will be ""worth the price.""He informed news agency AFP of ""speaking with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau tomorrow morning, and I'm also speaking with Mexico tomorrow morning.""""I don't expect anything very dramatic,"" he added.China, Mexico and Canada are the top three US trade partners and all have vowed to retaliate when the tariffs take effect Tuesday.","US President Donald Trump’s latest trade war proved to be a major blow for Canada, Mexico and China, pushing their currencies to multi-year lows.

NEW DELHI: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday announced that Canada would impose 25% tariffs on $106 billion worth US imports in a retaliatory move against Donald Trump. This came moments after the latter signed the executive order imposing steep tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, escalating tensions in an emerging trade war.""Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25% tariffs against Can$155 billion ($106 billion) worth of American goods,"" he saidHe urged the Canadians to prevent vacationing in US to fight back over the tariff imposition.Further, Trudeau announced that retaliatory duties on $30 billion worth of US alcohol and fruit will take effect Tuesday, coinciding with the implementation of US tariffs. He began his address with a direct message to American consumers.“It will have real consequences for you, the American people,” he said.“The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together,” Trudeau said, warning that it could bring about “dark times"" for many.Trump declared an economic emergency to impose tariffs of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada. However, energy imports from Canada—including oil, natural gas, and electricity—would be subject to a reduced 10% tariff.""Today, I have implemented a 25% Tariff on Imports from Mexico and Canada (10% on Canadian Energy), and a 10% additional Tariff on China.

We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all. I made a promise on my Campaign to stop the flood of illegal aliens and drugs from pouring across our Borders, and Americans overwhelmingly voted in favor of it,"" Trump said in a post on social media.Trump has argued that the government should rely more on tariff revenue, as it did before the introduction of the income tax in 1913. He asserts—despite economic evidence to the contrary—that the US was at its wealthiest during the 1890s under then-President William McKinley.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday announced that Canada would impose 25% tariffs on $106 billion worth US imports.

Why did the profits dip from the previous quarters ?

South Korean electronics giant Samsung reported a staggering 129.85 per cent year-on-year surge for the fourth quarter ending in December.It registered a growth of 6.5 trillion won, in its operating profits on Friday, against 2.82 trillion won, over the corresponding period last year.However, this growth in the fourth quarter was still low from its previous quarter for 2024 which stood at 9.18 trillion won, amid struggles in fulfilling demand for chips used in artificial intelligence servers.This announcement follows the company’s announcement in October, when it admitted going through a “crisis” and concerns were raised about its ""fundamental technological competitiveness and the future of the company"".The company recorded a net income growth of 22.2 per cent from the previous year at 7.75 trillion won.Sales also followed an upward momentum with a 11.8 percent growth at 75.78 trillion won.AFP reported that the company's net profit was higher than expected, according to Yonhap News Agency, which cited its own financial data firm.Samsung, the family-controlled conglomerates that dominate Asia's fourth-largest economy, said that the dip in profits from the previous quarter was due to ""soft market conditions especially for IT products, and an increase in expenditures including R&D.""""In the first quarter of 2025... overall earnings improvement may be limited due to weakness in the semiconductors business,"" it added.It has also been facing tough competition from its Korean rival SK hynix, which is US tech giant Nvidia’s main supplier of high-bandwidth memory (HBM).Samsung has been falling short of meeting Nvidia's requirements.Gloria Tsuen, a Moody's Ratings vice president and senior credit officer toldd AFP that Samsung’s technology leadership ""in the semiconductor market has been eroded over the last few years.""""The rapidly increasing demand for AI chips also heightens the technological difficulty in developing new, custom-made chips for customers in a timely manner,"" she added.","South Korean electronics giant Samsung reported a staggering 129.85 per cent year-on-year surge for the fourth quarter ending in December.

Donald Trump Economy: Donald Trump inherits strong economy as US growth rate hits 2.8% in 2024 amid ongoing inflation concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-growth-data-donald-trump-inherits-strong-economy-as-us-growth-rate-hits-2-8-in-2024-amid-ongoing-inflation-concerns/articleshow/117746316.cms,"Consumer spending remains robust



Inflation pressures persist



Donald Trump inherits a healthy economy



Global comparison



The US economy wrapped up 2024 on a solid note, with consumer spending and government support playing key roles in driving growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department.Despite some challenges, the economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected. For the full year, GDP grew by 2.8%, a strong performance, although slightly down from the 2.9% growth in 2023.Consumer spending rose by 4.2% in the final quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since early 2023. This growth was up from 3.7% in the previous quarter. The economy also benefitted from government spending and continued investment, although business investment slowed, particularly in equipment spending, which fell sharply after two strong quarters.Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, said, ""Consumers have been the foundation of the economy, and they've been the biggest driver of resilient growth in 2024,"" as quoted by the AFP news agency. He believes this growth will continue, supported by low layoffs, healthy job growth, and rising wages.The report also showed ongoing inflation. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, increased by 2.5%, slightly up from 2.2% in the previous quarter.Despite these inflation pressures, the economy remained strong. A key part of GDP, which excludes volatile items like exports and inventories, grew by 3.2% in the third quarter, down from 3.4% in the previous quarter.President Donald Trump, who took office in January 2025, inherited a strong economy, with growth continuing despite high interest rates. Unemployment was 4.1% in December, and job gains stayed steady. The Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged in December, after cutting it three times since September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell was quoted as saying to the Associated Press, “We do not need to be in a hurry to make more cuts,” due to the economy’s strength.The US economy is growing strongly, while Europe is struggling, having seen zero growth at the end of last year. The European Central Bank recently lowered its benchmark rate due to weak performance. In the US, strong consumer spending, low unemployment, and rising wages have helped maintain growth, despite ongoing inflation concerns.Trump has promised to cut taxes and reduce business regulations, but his plans on tariffs and immigration might slow growth and raise prices. KPMG's chief economist, Diane Swonk, pointed out that the effects of these policies will take time. While some analysts expect growth to slow in 2025, they still believe the US economy will remain strong for now.","US economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected.

Tesla reported lower than expected profits Wednesday but confirmed key 2025 benchmarks, saying it will return to sales volume growth and move forward with fully autonomous driving.The results -- the first since the return of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ally Donald Trump to the White House -- capped a mixed year for Tesla in which Musk's big bet on US electoral politics was countered by profit pressures as Tesla's streak of annual car volume growth came to an end.The electric car company reported fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter, where profits were boosted by a one-time tax benefit.Revenues rose two percent to $25.7 billion, also missing analyst estimates, but reflecting a more than doubling of sales in energy generation and storage.Musk has sought to temper expectations about Tesla's near-term financial growth, while employing superlatives in touting Tesla's autonomous driving and robotic ventures, saying they could make Tesla ""the most valuable company in the world by far,"" worth more than the ""next five companies combined.""Musk, who spent some $270 million or more to help Trump win the White House, largely steered clear of political subjects during the 65-minute conference call.The company has been confronted by intensifying EV competition in leading markets, including China and the United States, where General Motors and Ford have introduced more models.Another factor has been lower sales than expected from the Cybertruck, Musk's futuristic auto giant that has won cheers from Tesla fans and jeers from critics.But Tesla expects growth in 2025, saying in its earnings release that ""with the advancements in vehicle autonomy and the introduction of new products, we expect the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025.""The company confirmed plans to unveil new, more affordable vehicles in 2025 and said its launch of a new robotaxi venture in parts of the United States was on track to begin this year.Tesla named its driver-assistance programs ""autopilot"" and ""full self-driving"" (FSD), even though the programs require the driver to maintain attention, while rival robotaxi venture Waymo has achieved full driverless functionality in three US cities so far.Musk has repeatedly missed earlier targets towards full autonomy, quipping during Wednesday that he was like the boy who cried wolf.""But I'm telling you, there's a damn wolf this time, and you can drive it,"" Musk said. ""In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf.""Musk said he intends to launch FSD as a paid service in Austin, Texas this year, where the company also plans to introduce robotaxi services.""Teslas will be in the wild,"" he said, describing a gradual expansion of service once the company can demonstrate its autonomous service is ""unequivocally safer"" than a human driver.Musk did not directly comment on how his alliance with Trump will affect Tesla.The billionaire's widening influence and activism on behalf of far-right political movements has drawn rising attention and blowback. Polling data released Wednesday by YouGov showed Musk with a 44 percent favorable public opinion compared with a 48 percent negative.That's a worse ratio than Trump, who came in at three points net-positive, according to YouGov.A coalition that includes a public workers union has filed a lawsuit to block Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, arguing the panel flouts federal laws and is ""beset"" by the conflicts of interest of an extremist ""libertarian billionaire class.""And only days after being criticized for a hand gesture at Trump's inauguration that resembled a Nazi salute, Musk drew scrutiny last weekend for reiterating support for Germany's far-right, anti-immigrant AfD party, including comments that young Germans should feel able ""to move beyond"" expressing regret for the Holocaust.During the call, Musk's most overtly political comment concerned what he described as the cumbersome process to introduce FSD in Europe, calling Europe ""a layer cake of regulations and bureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed.""Shares of Tesla rose 4.4 percent in after-hours trading.","Tesla reports fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

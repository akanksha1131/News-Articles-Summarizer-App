Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in green on Monday. While Nifty50 went above 24,600, BSE Sensex was up over 150 points. At 9:18 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,627.85, up 63 points or 0.25%.

A clear direction will emerge on news surrounding the US-India trade deal happening after the next round of trade negotiations. A deal with a tariff of 20% or below will be positive from the market perspective. If this doesn’t happen, and the 25% tariff remains, the market is likely to drift down since it will impact India’s growth and corporate earnings making it difficult to justify the current elevated valuations.“From the global market perspective, indications are that a rate cut from the Fed in the September FOMC meeting is likely after the latest jobs report indicating declines in job additions in July and downward revisions in the jobs created in May and June. Clearly, the U.S. economy is slowing down and Fed is likely to respond with a rate cut in September. With the inflationary impact of the tariffs kicking in, a stagflationnary scenario for the US cannot be ruled out. The market will respond to incoming data and evolving outlook.""Asian equities continued their downward trend for the seventh consecutive session following disappointing US employment data, which led to a decline in stocks and increased speculation about Federal Reserve rate reductions.US stocks fell on Friday, with the S&P recording its largest daily percentage drop in over two months, triggered by new US tariffs affecting multiple trading partners and an unexpectedly poor jobs report.Gold prices decreased on Monday as traders took profits following a significant increase in the previous session, after disappointing US employment data strengthened predictions of a Federal Reserve interest rate reduction in September.Oil prices continued to decrease on Monday following OPEC+'s agreement to another substantial production increase in September, whilst worries about economic slowdown in the United States, the world's largest oil consumer, contributed to downward pressure.Foreign portfolio investors net sold shares worth Rs 3,366 crore on Friday.

India's Crude Oil Imports From U.S. Jump 51% Since Donald Trump's Return To White House

How Much Russian Oil Does India Buy?

Traditionally, India sourced the majority of its oil requirements from Middle Eastern nations, particularly Iraq and Saudi Arabia. This procurement pattern shifted significantly following Russia-Ukraine in February 2022.

As the world's third-largest crude importer, following China and the US, India began purchasing Russian oil at discounted rates after Western nations boycotted Russian supplies as a punitive measure against Moscow's military actions in Ukraine.

Russia has evolved from holding a minimal 0.2% share in India's import portfolio before the Ukraine conflict to becoming the country's primary supplier, surpassing both Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and reaching a peak share of 40%.

Currently, Russian oil comprises 36% of India's total crude oil imports, which is subsequently processed into various fuel products including petrol and diesel.

India's crude oil imports from Russia stood at 68,000 barrels per day in January 2022, as reported by Kpler, a global real-time data and analytics provider. During the same period, India received 1.23 million bpd from Iraq and 883,000 bpd from Saudi Arabia.

Russia emerged as India's primary oil supplier in June 2022, surpassing Iraq. Russian supplies reached 1.12 million bpd, whilst Iraq provided 993,000 bpd and Saudi Arabia delivered 695,000 bpd, according to a PTI report quoting Kpler data.

Russian oil supplies reached their highest point at 2.15 million bpd in May 2023, with fluctuations based on available price discounts.

The supply consistently remained above 1.4 million bpd, exceeding India's pre-Ukraine conflict imports from its then-leading supplier, Iraq.

Current Russian oil imports average 1.78 million bpd, significantly higher than Iraq's 900,000 bpd. According to Kpler's data, Saudi Arabia's contribution stands at 702,000 bpd.

Following western sanctions on Russian energy after the Ukraine war, Russia offered substantial price reductions to willing crude oil buyers. The difference between Russia's primary Urals crude and the globally recognised Brent benchmark initially reached $40 per barrel, but has since narrowed to under $3.

US Penalty Risk For India

Will India Stop Buying Crude From Russia?

How Much Defence Equipment Does India Buy From Russia?

India is faced with the prospect of an additional penalty from the Donald Trump administration for its procurement of oil and defence equipment from Russia. While announcing a 25% tariff rate for India this week, Trump also warned of a penalty for India’s trade ties with Russia.He specifically criticised these actions ""at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE.""""India will therefore be paying a tariff of 25%, plus a penalty for the above (Russian purchases), starting on August First,"" he posted on Truth Social.India's dependency on Russian oil has gone up significantly from a mere 0.2% prior to the Russia-Ukraine conflict to currently representing 35-40% of total crude imports! This shift has attracted renewed attention following US President Donald Trump's announcement of additional penalties atop a 25% tariff on all US-bound goods.Also Read | Donald Trump's 25% tariff: India expects minimal impact; indicates agriculture, dairy, GM food no-go areas in trade deal talks Trump administration officials have said that India buying oil from Russia is an ‘irritant’ for the US. How much crude oil does India get from Russia? What will happen if the US imposes a penalty and has India stopped buying Russian oil? We take a look:In December 2022, G7 nations announced a $60 per barrel ceiling on Russian crude prices. This arrangement allowed European firms to continue shipping and insuring Russian oil deliveries to third countries, provided the sales price remained below the ceiling - aiming to maintain global oil supply whilst reducing Russian revenue.The European Union has recently adjusted the price cap to $47.6, incorporating an automatic review system. This revision aims to maintain the cap at 15% below average market prices.The recent EU ban on Russian-origin refined product imports, coupled with Trump's warning, creates significant challenges for Indian refiners.According to analysts, if India is forced to shift away from Russian crude due to US threats of additional tariffs or penalties on Indian exports, the nation's yearly oil import expenses could increase by $9-11 billion.According to a PTI report, Kpler's Lead Research Analyst (Refining & Modeling), Sumit Ritolia, describes this situation as ""a squeeze from both ends"".Also Read | Donald Trump to help Pakistan build ‘massive oil reserves’! How much known crude oil does it have & how does that compare to India? Top points to know The EU sanctions, which take effect from January 2026, could require Indian refiners to modify their crude intake patterns, whilst the US tariff threat suggests possible secondary sanctions affecting shipping, insurance, and financing aspects of India's Russian oil trade.These combined measures restrict India's crude procurement options, increase compliance risks, and create substantial cost uncertainties.India's crude oil imports in the previous fiscal year exceeded $137 billion, which is processed to produce fuels including petrol and diesel.The situation is particularly critical for major refiners such as Reliance Industries Ltd and Nayara Energy, who together process more than 50 per cent in 2025 of India's Russian crude imports, ranging between 1.7-2.0 million barrels per day (bpd).Interestingly, India has substantially boosted its crude oil purchases from the United States following President Donald Trump's re-election to the White House, according to an ANI report. Imports have risen more than 50% when compared with last year.“From January to June 25, India increased its imports of US average crude supplies by 51 per cent compared to the same period last year. (From .271 mb/d in January to June 2025 as compared to 0.18 mb/d in the same period last year),” sources told ANI.US President Donald Trump on Friday commented that India might stop purchasing Russian oil, describing it as ""a good step"" if accurate. However, India has consistently maintained its right to implement energy policies aligned with national interests.Also Read | Donald Trump’s 25% tariff, ‘dead economy’ jibe: India sends clear message to the US in 5 points - what Piyush Goyal said When questioned about potential penalties for India and discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump stated, ""I understand that India is no longer going to be buying oil from Russia. That's what I heard, I don't know if that's right or not. That is a good step. We will see what happens...""India continues to maintain its independent stance on Russian oil purchases, with no directives issued to refiners to halt imports.. Both government-owned and private refiners retain autonomy in their procurement decisions, which are based on commercial considerations, sources told Bloomberg.Sources told ANI that Russia holds a significant position in global oil markets, producing approximately 9.5 mb/d, which represents nearly 10% of worldwide demand. As the second-largest crude producer and exporter globally, Russia exports about 4.5 mb/d of crude and 2.3 mb/d of refined products.Sources speaking to ANI specifically rebutted speculation about India discontinuing Russian oil purchases and Trump's subsequent remarks supporting these reports.Trump’s post on Truth Social not only targeted India’s oil purchases from Russia, but also its procurement of arms. The United States was the world’s largest arms exporter with a share of 43% in global arm exports between 2020-2024. Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and Japan are the main recipients of these exports.Russia was the third largest arms exporter in the same period, with a 7.8% share in global arms exports. This has dropped by 64% from 21% in 2015-2019. The main recipients of Russia’s arms were India, China and Kazakhstan.India ranked as the second-largest arms importer globally during 2020-24, accounting for 8.3% of worldwide arms imports. It saw a decline of 9.3% in arms imports when comparing the periods 2015-19 and 2020-24.Also Read | Russia oil squeeze: Trump’s 100% tariff threat - should India panic?

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates continue to hover in a range as news on Donald Trump’s trade policies flows in. Where are gold prices headed and what should investors do?Gold futures remain under pressure as the MCX Gold October Futures contract struggles to recover from recent declines. After a brief pullback from the intraday lows, prices are currently hovering around ₹98,778, with key technical indicators pointing to a weak rebound lacking bullish momentum. In light of the current setup, traders are advised to adopt a Sell on Rise strategy near ₹99,000, with a stop-loss at ₹99,450.The 8-period EMA is at ₹98,765, and the 21-period EMA is at ₹98,800. Price is trying to reclaim these levels but is struggling to close decisively above either, indicating hesitation and overhead resistance. A failure to sustain above ₹99,000 would confirm bearish control.A clear lower-high lower-low formation dominates the 15-minute chart. The attempt to bounce back from the ₹98,600–₹98,700 zone is facing headwinds from the declining short-term moving averages. Selling interest is visible on every upward tick.Despite a modest bounce, volume remains uneven and not supportive of a bullish reversal. Open interest trends also suggest caution, with no aggressive long buildup detected.This favors the view of a corrective pullback rather than a trend change.The previous day’s pivot and price action suggest that the ₹99,000–₹99,200 range remains a critical resistance zone. The multiple failed attempts to hold above this level make it an ideal sell zone for intraday setups.• The RSI is approaching the 50–52 zone but has not broken above convincingly, implying weak upside momentum.• While the MACD is not visible in the chart, the price structure suggests a shallow or weak crossover at best, lacking strength to confirm bullish continuation.Given the confluence of resistance around ₹99,000, lack of follow-through volume, and weak momentum, traders may consider a Sell on Rise strategy in the range of ₹99,000–₹99,100, maintaining a stop-loss at ₹99,450. Downside targets include ₹98,550, followed by ₹98,200 if selling intensifies. Until the price decisively breaks and sustains above the 21 EMA with supportive volume, the trend remains vulnerable to further declines.","Gold futures remain under pressure as the MCX Gold October Futures contract struggles to recover from recent declines.

Trump's Pakistan Oil Gambit Backfires On Day 1; 'U.S. Being Deceived, No Reserves In Pak' | Watch

How ‘Massive’ Are Pakistan’s Oil Reserves Really?

Oil Reserves: Pak Not Even a Drop

Oil Refining: India at 4, Pakistan nowhere

Oil Production: Miles Behind Even India

Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Enterprises has mocked US President Donald Trump’s suggestion that Pakistan may one day sell oil to India. Trump has said that America will help Pakistan build ‘massive oil reserves’ such that it may even sell to India some day.Taking a witty dig on the statement, Goenka posted on X (formerly Twitter), “Saying Pakistan will sell oil to India is like saying a tailender will hit a triple century in a T20 match. Technically possible. Realistically? More likely to happen in Lagaan than in real life.”Earlier this week, Trump posted on Truth Social, “We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,"" Trump posted on Truth Social. ""We are in the process of choosing the oil company that will lead this partnership. Who knows, maybe they'll be selling oil to India some day!”Also Read | Donald Trump's 25% tariff: India expects minimal impact; indicates agriculture, dairy, GM food no-go areas in trade deal talks Trump’s deal with Pakistan imposes a 19% tariff on Pakistan’s exports to the US.The US-Pakistan deal comes at a time when India-US trade negotiations appear to have hit a deadlock. Trump has announced 25% tariffs on India, effective August 7, 2025. He has also said that an additional penalty will be levied for India’s continued imports of Russia’s oil and defence equipment. Trump administration officials have said that India’s Russia oil buys are an ‘irritant’ for the US.Trump's assertion about assisting Pakistan in building huge oil reserves for potential exports to India appears overly optimistic.According to a TOI report, Pakistan has merely 0.02% of worldwide crude oil deposits.Pakistan’s daily oil production stands at approximately 70,000 barrels, which is less than 10% of India's output. Rather than being positioned as a prospective energy exporter, Pakistan's current standing in the international oil sector remains notably insignificant!According to a Reuters report, Pakistan holds proven crude oil reserves of just between 234 million and 353 million barrels, placing it at the 50th position globally in terms of crude oil reserves.For a contextual comparison, Venezuela possesses the world's largest crude oil reserves, at 303,221 million barrels, as per recent OPEC statistics! India's known crude oil reserves as of 2024 are around 4,800-4,900 million barrels, which exceeds Pakistan's reserves by more than tenfold!Although Pakistan has time and again claimed that it has huge crude oil reserves along its coastline, actual extraction of these resources has never happened. Pakistan continues to seek foreign investments to develop these potential resources.Last year, Pakistan announced the finding of potentially substantial oil and natural gas reserves within its maritime territory. It suggested that these resources, if confirmed, could have a transformative impact on Pakistan's economic prospects.A three-year underwater survey, conducted with support from an unnamed ""friendly country,"" identified significant submerged geological structures indicating possible oil and gas deposits. However, these preliminary findings currently lack verification.The actual presence, volume and quality of these resources remain unconfirmed, as no commercial drilling activities have been undertaken to validate the initial survey results.The structural geology of the Indus Basin, shaped by tectonic activity and rich in mudstone deposits, creates suitable conditions for finding hydrocarbons. Analysis of seismic data reveals significant source rocks and possible reservoirs, yet Pakistan has not achieved successful extraction in its offshore regions. Earlier exploration efforts, including the Kekra-1 drilling operation, have not yielded positive results.Pakistan presently depends on Middle Eastern countries for its petroleum requirements through imports. The country's oil import bill stands at $11.3 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, which is actually its highest import expenditure. The country’s central bank data indicates that petroleum imports constitute approximately 20% of Pakistan's overall import costs.Also Read | After Donald Trump’s ‘massive oil reserves’ deal, US to ship crude to Pakistan soon; here’s why it’s significant for Pak","Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Enterprises has mocked US President Donald Trump’s suggestion that Pakistan may one day sell oil to India.

India is rapidly emerging as a major force in the global semiconductor landscape, with its domestic market aimed to grow from $38 billion in 2023 to between $100 and $110 billion by 2030. This projection comes as the global semiconductor industry is set to touch the $1 trillion mark by the end of the decade, according to a government statement cited by ANI on Sunday.The government noted that India is transitioning swiftly from policy formulation to tangible production in the semiconductor space, with fabrication, assembly, and design centres being set up across the country. ""The global semiconductor market is expected to reach USD 1 Trillion by 2030 with India's market occupying a substantial portion of it,"" it said, quoted by ANI.Several large-scale investments have been committed to semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, reinforcing India’s ambitions. In June 2023, Micron Technology announced a Rs 22,516 crore investment in an ATMP (Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging) facility in Sanand, Gujarat. In February 2024, Tata Electronics, in partnership with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, committed Rs 91,000 crore to a wafer fabrication plant in Dholera, Gujarat, with a planned capacity of 50,000 wafers per month.Also in February, CG Power & Industrial Solutions, along with Renesas and Stars, proposed a Rs 7,600 crore chip-making facility in Sanand, aiming to produce 15 million chips daily. Tata Semiconductor Assembly and Test Pvt Ltd (TSAT) is setting up a Rs 27,000 crore facility in Morigaon, Assam, with a production target of 48 million chips daily. In September 2024, Kaynes Semicon Pvt Ltd is set to launch operations in Sanand with a Rs 3,307 crore investment and a daily output of 6.33 million chips. By May 2025, a joint venture between HCL and Foxconn will begin operations in Jewar, Uttar Pradesh, with a Rs 3,700 crore facility producing 20,000 wafers monthly—equivalent to 36 million units annually.The government also outlined how India is poised to contribute to three critical pillars of the semiconductor supply chain. In equipment, India is leveraging its robust MSME ecosystem to scale up the production of essential semiconductor equipment components. In materials, India’s reserves of chemicals, minerals, and industrial gases position it well to support raw material needs for chip production. In services, the country boasts a large talent pool skilled in R&D, logistics, and next-generation technologies such as AI, big data, cloud computing, and IoT, strengthening its backend and design capabilities.To support this transformation, the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) was launched in December 2021, with an outlay of Rs 76,000 crore. The initiative aims to incentivise investments in chip fabrication, display manufacturing, and design infrastructure. Guided by global experts, ISM serves as the central agency for implementing semiconductor-related schemes and policies. Alongside ISM, initiatives like the SEMICON India Programme and India-US Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) are helping deepen India’s global integration in the electronics value chain.Semiconductors form the backbone of all modern electronics—from smartphones to satellites. India’s push into this domain is expected to fuel the digital economy, enhance national security, reduce dependency on imports, and increase technological self-reliance. A recent example of domestic capability was seen during the Chandrayaan-3 mission, where the Vikram lander used Indian-built chips and AI to autonomously identify a safe landing site—showcasing homegrown semiconductor applications in space and defence.As approved facilities begin operations and new projects gather momentum, India is steadily evolving from a chip consumer into a critical global contributor to semiconductor manufacturing.",India is rapidly emerging as a major force in the global semiconductor landscape.

Leh: Nippon India MF is exploring the launch of simple, easy-to-understand mutual fund products for first-time investors in remote areas.At the launch of the fund house's Leh branch - the first physical presence for any asset management company in Ladakh - CEO Sundeep Sikka said that though people in the region were earning well, they invested in unregulated informal products due to limited financial literacy.The move aims to boost mutual fund participation in a region that accounts for just over 0.1% of India's MF assets.

Mumbai: The country's oldest bad loan company, IPO-bound Arcil (Asset Reconstruction Company of India) , gives an insight into the future of loan recovery for retail loans in its offer document filed with Sebi.The company has said it is setting up a digital platform that will allow defaulting retail borrowers to submit settlement offers and receive instant acceptance, eliminating the need for manual intervention. With a shrinking pool of corporate NPAs, Arcil is pivoting towards technology-driven retail loan recovery as its promoters look to sell a third of the company through an IPO.The shift marks a strategic overhaul for Arcil, which was set up in 2002 to clean up banks' balance sheets by acquiring large stressed corporate loans. According to its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), Arcil also plans to pilot its recovery infrastructure as a service for banks managing overdue retail loans. If successful, this could create a fee-based revenue stream and reduce its dependence on acquiring bad assets.The company also now sees greater opportunity in retail and SME loans, where defaults are rising. Retail loan stress has grown from Rs 3.5 lakh crore in FY20 to nearly Rs 6.9 lakh crore in FY25, at a CAGR of 14.8%.To tap this market, Arcil is expanding its footprint in semi-urban and rural areas, where most of the stress is concentrated. It is in discussions with small finance banks and NBFC-MFIs to acquire retail and SME loan portfolios. At the same time, it is deploying data analytics and geo-tracking of field agents to improve recovery efficiency, while offering QR code-based and UPI payment solutions to defaulting borrowers.The company is not exiting the corporate segment entirely. It will continue to target mid-sized stressed accounts, particularly in commercial real estate, where resolution timelines are shorter. However, its overall corporate recovery pipeline has thinned, with corporate stress in banks and NBFCs falling to Rs 6.5 lakh crore in FY24, down from Rs 6.9 lakh crore in FY22. Arcil has filed draft papers for an IPO comprising a 100% offer for sale.","The shift marks a strategic overhaul for Arcil, which was set up in 2002 to clean up banks' balance sheets by acquiring large stressed corporate loans.

Mumbai: The less, the merrier - that's the mantra in the startup and venture capital space, where there's an increasing shift towards building smaller teams. More investors are now also considering the size of a startup's team while weighing potential funding - it is not a big determining factor yet, but at least it is a metric being considered, with the 'revenue per employee' metric making its way into investor discussions.AI has a part to play in this shift - the tech is not leading to wide-scale job reductions, but it certainly is eliminating the need to hire more, and nudging companies to redeploy human capital towards more complex tasks.""Investors have become intensely focused on startups that demonstrate capital efficiency and a high revenue per employee ratio. The excesses of the last funding boom, marked by aggressive headcount growth has given way to an era where impact is measured by output, not team size,"" Manu Iyer, general partner at Bluehill VC, which funds early-stage startups, told TOI, adding that, on average, today, series A (early stage) startups globally and in India come to market with fewer full-time employees.Even as startups as big as Paytm and Ola are betting on AI to cut inefficiencies at work, the trend of building smaller teams is more rampant among deep tech and AI-native startups.

Slow Hiring, Job Cut Hit

Not Out Of The Woods Yet

Mumbai: Layoffs in India's IT sector is bad news for consumption. After IT giant TCS announced cutting more than 12,000 jobs, a spectre of uncertainty looms over the sector with industry body Nasscom hinting at more layoffs - this could have a bearing on discretionary consumption, squeezing demand for apparel to and electronics, say experts, as during periods of downturn, people tend to save more.A slowdown in the tech industry, which employs thousands of engineers every year, many of whom are millennials and Gen Zs who drive a significant share of household spending.Company earnings show that consumption growth in India is uneven - it seems to be on a gradual path to recovery after several sluggish quarters, but it certainly isn't galloping with firms such as Colgate-Palmolive calling out ""tough"" operating conditions in its Q1FY26 earnings.Economic sentiments and job uncertainties in the IT sector can have a ""cascading"" effect on consumption, Joy Alukkas, CMD at Joyalukkas Group told TOI, adding that ""sustained consumption growth will depend on economic stability and job security"". Alukkas, however, expects the impact on jewellery segment to be somewhat limited given the emotional and investment value Indians attach to gold.Even at a slower rate of hiring growth, IT added some 120,000 jobs in the previous fiscal, said Nitin Bhatt, technology sector leader at EY India. The FY26 hiring outlook remains bleak, Bhatt said.Low inflation, reduced interest rates and tax breaks (which kicked in from April) had set the pitch for consumption to take off across the board with companies hoping that the benefits would soon start to trickle in. Not everyone has seen the full benefit yet and uncertainty in the job market risks impeding any potential macro gains.Akhil Jain, CEO & MD at fashion brand Madame said that despite some tailwinds from easing inflation and tax reforms, the broader recovery in full-price retail demand remains patchy. ""Job uncertainty in sectors like IT does impact consumption, particularly in categories like fashion,"" said Jain.Sunil Agarwal, chairman at RSH Global, which makes personal care brand Joy, said that the company is seeing signs of cautious spending. ""The IT layoff trend has created some unease in consumer sentiment,"" Agarwal said, adding that the festive season sales will be the real indicator of the impact on demand.","IT giant TCS announced cutting more than 12,000 jobs, with industry body Nasscom hinting at more layoffs.

US Tariffs on India

The US decision to impose 25% tariffs will have minimal effect on India, sources told PTI. India is clear that duty exemptions for agricultural, dairy and genetically modified (GM) products in trade agreements is a no-go area, the report said, quoting sources.Negotiations between New Delhi and the US regarding the trade deal are ongoing. The US delegation is scheduled to visit India on August 25 for the sixth round of discussions.In the fiscal year 2024-25, trade between India and the US reached $131.8 billion, which includes $86.5 billion in exports and $45.3 billion in imports.A significant portion of Indian exports, including pharmaceutical and electronic items, already fall under the US exemption category and therefore would not incur duties, sources told PTI.""More than half of India's exports to the US (are expected) to remain unimpacted. Due to the Section 232 exemption of the US, only exports worth about $40 billion would be impacted with these tariffs,"" they added.Several sectors would face a 25% duty impact, including electrical and mechanical machinery (approximately $9 billion), gems and jewellery ($12 billion), shrimp ($2.24 billion), textiles/clothing ($10.3 billion), leather and footwear ($1.18 billion), animal products ($2 billion), chemicals (2.34 billion).""More than half of India's exports to the US will not be impacted by the duty. Due to the Section 232 exemption of the US, only exports worth about $48 billion would be impacted with these tariffs,"" they said, adding that the remaining exports will have a little impact on a country with a GDP of about $4 trillion and a consumer base of 140 crore.Officials highlighted concerns regarding the US dairy sector's use of animal feed, noting that India has consistently refrained from offering duty concessions in this sector across all its trade agreements.""There are religious sentiments in the dairy sector. So, it is not acceptable. There will be no compromise on these segments in any of India's trade pacts,"" they said, according to the report.Also Read | Donald Trump tariff impact?

SEBI Unveils ‘Valid’ UPI System to Protect Investors from Fraud in Capital Markets Starting Oct 1

UPI New Rules 2025: Top Things to Know

Cap on balance enquiries to prevent system overload

Limit on bank account access via “list account” API

Restrictions on UPI autopay transactions during peak hours

Industry reaction welcomes move towards efficiency

Deadline set for compliance; penalties for violations

Starting August 1, 2025, UPI will see changes as the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the UPI ecosystem.The changes are aimed at improving system efficiency, preventing outages, and ensuring better user consent mechanisms.Payment Service Providers (PSPs), UPI apps, and banks must implement the changes by July 31, as per NPCI’s compliance notice dated May 21.A major change includes a cap on balance enquiry requests, now limited to 50 per app per customer in a rolling 24-hour period, as per ET.These requests must be user-initiated only, with no automatic prompts by apps or systems. UPI apps must also introduce the ability to reduce or halt such requests during peak load hours to minimise system strain.The guidelines also require issuer banks to include the available account balance in every successful UPI transaction message, streamlining user experience and reducing the need for separate balance checks.NPCI has also put in place access limits on the “list account” API, which lets users view bank accounts linked to their mobile number. This API will now be restricted to 25 requests per customer per app per day, and only after the user selects their bank in the app.Any retries must be made with explicit customer consent, ensuring transparency and avoiding unnecessary API calls.To further address system congestion, NPCI has restricted UPI Autopay executions to non-peak hours only. Peak hours are defined as 10:00 to 13:00 and 17:00 to 21:30.Each autopay mandate will be allowed one initial attempt and a maximum of three retries, clearly capped at four total executions per mandate sequence.Welcoming the new rules, Tarun Nazare, co-founder and managing director of Neokred was quoted as saying by ET that “These measures are prudent and forward-thinking, as they prioritise system efficiency and user security. By capping balance requests and optimising API usage—especially with clear restrictions during peak hours—the guidelines will effectively reduce server overloads and potential service outages. ”He also highlighted the value of “emphasis on customer consent and timely compliance” in enhancing system accountability.The NPCI has clearly warned that failure to comply with these directives by July 31, 2025, may result in UPI API restrictions, penalties, suspension of new customer onboarding, or any other appropriate action.NPCI has advised all member banks and UPI ecosystem participants to communicate these changes across their systems and partners ahead of the compliance deadline.","The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the UPI ecosystem.

Donald Trump tariffs: US advisor rules out talks; says rates are ‘pretty much set’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-tariffs-us-advisor-rules-out-talks-says-rates-are-pretty-much-set/articleshow/123080067.cms,"AI image

US President Donald Trump's trade advisor Jamieson Greer has said the new American tariff rates are “pretty much set” with limited scope for negotiation, defending the Trump administration’s latest round of levies, including harsh duties on Brazil.In a pre-recorded interview aired on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday, US trade representative Greer said the rates were mostly determined by previously announced or confidential deals. “A lot of these are set rates pursuant to deals... others depend on the level of the trade deficit or surplus we may have with the country,” he explained.As per news agency AFP, Greer further noted that while some countries might still seek dialogue, the administration had reached a point where “we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.”The newly announced tariffs, unveiled last Thursday, will take effect on August 7 instead of the earlier proposed August 1 deadline. The move allows more time for US Customs and Border Protection to update its systems, reported AFP, citing a senior official.One of the most significant tariff hikes targets Brazil, which now faces a 50 per cent duty on exports to the US. However, exemptions have been made for some key products like aircraft and orange juice.US President Donald Trump has openly admitted the measure is linked to Brazil’s prosecution of his political ally Jair Bolsonaro. The former Brazilian president is facing charges related to an alleged coup plot. Trump called the prosecution a “witch hunt.”Greer defended the geopolitical use of tariffs, saying: “The president has seen in Brazil, like he’s seen in other countries, a misuse of law, a misuse of democracy.” He added, “It is normal to use these tools for geopolitical issues.”White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett echoed Greer’s views, telling NBC’s Meet the Press with Kristen Welker that while minor discussions may continue, most tariff rates are “more or less locked in.” He also ruled out any major revisions even if markets react negatively. “These are the final deals,” Hassett stated.As per AFP, the latest tariff move is part of Trump’s broader push to rebalance global trade ties.His executive order signed last Thursday enforces increased tariffs on 95 countries and territories, ranging from 10 per cent to 41 per cent.India, for example, has been hit with a 25 per cent duty over what the White House termed “obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers” and ongoing energy ties with Russia. Switzerland faces a 39 per cent tariff, while Syria tops the list with 41 per cent.Legal challenges are also emerging. An appeals court panel expressed scepticism last week over the administration’s authority to impose such duties, indicating the case may go to the US Supreme Court.","US President Donald Trump's trade advisor Jamieson Greer has said the new American tariff rates are “pretty much set” with limited scope for negotiation. Greer said the rates were mostly determined by previously announced or confidential deals. The newly announced tariffs, unveiled last Thursday, will take effect on August 7.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123080209,imgsize-53718,width-400,resizemode-4/123080209.jpg"
"OPEC+ output hike: V8 to raise oil production by 547,000 bpd; move aimed at reclaiming market share",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/opec-output-hike-v8-to-raise-oil-production-by-547000-bpd-move-aimed-at-reclaiming-market-share/articleshow/123079023.cms,"AI image

Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other key members of the OPEC+ alliance, collectively known as the Voluntary Eight (V8), have agreed to increase oil production by 547,000 barrels per day (bpd) starting September 2025, a move seen as an attempt to regain market share amid resilient oil prices.As per news agency AFP, the decision was finalised after a meeting of the eight producers, Iraq, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, Oman, along with the Saudis and Russians, who currently produce around 41-42 million bpd.The new hike represents an increase of about 1.5% in total output.The group had already begun rolling back output cuts in April, part of a wider plan to unwind the 2.2 million bpd production reduction announced last year. As per the post-meeting statement, ""The eight participating countries will implement a production adjustment of 547,000 barrels per day in September 2025 from the August 2025 required production level.""OPEC added that the increase is being undertaken “in view of a steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories.”The group also left the door open to revisiting the decision, stating that “the phase-out of the additional voluntary production adjustments may be paused or reversed subject to evolving market conditions.”Analysts believe the hike is unlikely to cause significant price fluctuations. Brent crude is currently trading at around $70 per barrel. ""OPEC+ has passed the first test, unwinding 2.2 million barrels per day without crashing prices or compromising unity,"" Jorge Leon of Rystad Energy was quoted as saying by AFP.However, he warned that “the next task will be even harder: deciding if and when to unwind the remaining 1.66 million barrels, all while navigating geopolitical tension and preserving cohesion.”The latest move also includes a specific allotment of 300,000 bpd for the UAE, accelerating the timeline for production recovery by nearly a year from the initially planned 18-month schedule.Despite the shift towards higher output, OPEC+ continues to stress its commitment to stability. “The alliance is striving to find a balance between regaining market share and avoiding a sharp drop in oil prices,” said Tamas Varga of PVM Oil Associates, as per AFP.Experts are also wary of emerging uncertainties. According to AFP, analysts are closely watching potential risks from US President Donald Trump's trade and geopolitical policies, including tariffs and the evolving situation in Ukraine.The V8 will next meet on September 7 to assess market conditions, while the full 22-member OPEC+ alliance will hold its ministerial meeting at the end of November to decide on the path forward.","Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other key members of the OPEC+ alliance have agreed to increase oil production by 547,000 barrels per day starting September 2025.

Steep tariffs for those resisting Trump's demands

Legal battle escalates as costs rise for US consumers

Winners still end up paying more

US President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariff regime, set to take effect August 7, has triggered a wave of economic disruption across the globe, from low-income nations like Laos and Algeria to wealthy trade partners such as Canada and Switzerland.Under the new policy, countries face steep new import duties unless they agree to revised trade terms with the US. Trump has framed the plan as a campaign for ""fairness"" under the slogan of ""Liberation Day,"" invoking a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency and bypass Congress. But legal and economic blowback is mounting, with US courts weighing challenges and allies questioning Washington's reliability, AP reported.""In many respects, everybody's a loser here,"" said Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School. ""The U.S. consumer's a big loser,"" added Alan Wolff, a former WTO deputy director-general and trade official.Even countries that struck deals to reduce their tariff exposure are still facing steeper import duties than before. The UK agreed to raise tariffs on its exports to the US from 1.3% to 10%, despite the US running a trade surplus with it for nearly two decades.The EU and Japan accepted 15% tariffs, lower than the threatened rates but still significantly higher than last year's levels.Nations that refused to negotiate fared far worse. Laos and Algeria, despite low per capita incomes, now face tariffs of 40% and 30% respectively. Brazil was slapped with a 50% levy, reportedly over its treatment of former president Jair Bolsonaro. Canada drew a 35% tariff, tied in part to its position on Palestinian statehood.Even Switzerland, which did not reach an agreement, was hit with a 39% import tax, exceeding the originally announced 31%.""The Swiss probably wish that they had camped in Washington to make a deal,"" said Wolff, now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Five US businesses and 12 states have filed lawsuits against the new tariffs, arguing that Trump overstepped his authority. In May, the US Court of International Trade sided with plaintiffs, blocking the tariffs, though collections continue during the appeal process.Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that US businesses and consumers are absorbing most of the cost. Companies including Walmart, Nike, Best Buy and Procter & Gamble have all raised prices in response.""This is a consumption tax, so it disproportionately affects those with lower incomes,"" said Appleton. ""Your appliances are going to go up. Your TV and electronics are going to go up. Your video game devices, consoles are going to go up.""According to Yale University's Budget Lab, the average US tariff has jumped from 2.5% at the start of 2025 to 18.3%, the highest since 1934. The lab estimates this will cost the average US household $2,400 annually.Even countries that reached deals to avoid Trump's harshest penalties are still absorbing high tariffs. Taiwan saw its rate lowered from 32% to 20%, and Angola's from 32% to 15% — but both were paying less than 2% before the new policy.Lesotho, one of the poorest nations affected, saw its tariff reduced from 50% to 15%, though economists say the damage may already be done.""He [Trump] wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,"" said Wolff, referring to Trump's transactional approach to global trade.","US President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariff regime, set to take effect August 7, has triggered a wave of economic disruption across the globe.

Insane Tesla Coil Performance BLOWS Elon Musk Away: Electricity Flies Between Performers | WATCH

A federal jury in Miami has ruled that Tesla must pay over $200 million in damages after finding its Autopilot driver-assist technology was partly responsible for a fatal 2019 crash that killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injured Dillon Angulo in Florida.The jury awarded $200 million in punitive damages and $43 million out of a total $129 million in compensatory damages to be paid by Tesla, concluding that the company’s driver-assist system failed and bore significant responsibility for the crash. This decision makes Tesla liable for nearly two-thirds of the total damages, reported AP.The verdict also comes at a critical time for CEO Elon Musk, who is pushing to expand Tesla’s autonomous vehicle technology and roll out a driverless taxi service in multiple US cities.The incident occurred when George McGee, who was driving a Tesla vehicle, ran through flashing lights, a stop sign, and a T-intersection at 62 mph, crashing into the parked Chevrolet Tahoe.Responding to the ruling, Tesla issued a statement calling the verdict “wrong,” and argued that it undermines the industry's efforts to develop lifesaving technology.“Today’s verdict is wrong,"" and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla’s and the entire industry’s efforts to develop and implement lifesaving technology”.They said the plaintiffs concocted a story ”blaming the car when the driver from day one admitted and accepted responsibility. ”The plaintiffs’ lead attorney Brett Schreiber, conceded that the driver, George McGee, acted negligently by running through flashing lights, a stop sign, and a T-intersection at a speed of 62 miles per hour before crashing into a parked Chevrolet Tahoe.“I trusted the technology too much,” McGee said during his testimony. “I believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.”However, Schreiber maintained that Tesla also bore responsibility. He argued that the company enabled dangerous driving behavior by failing to automatically disable Autopilot when drivers became distracted, and by permitting its use on roads like the one McGee was on—routes the system wasn’t intended to operate on.Tesla’s lead defense attorney in the Miami trial, Joel Smith, responded by emphasizing that the company clearly instructs drivers to stay attentive and keep their hands on the wheel. He said McGee ignored those warnings while searching for a dropped cellphone and was speeding, increasing the risk. Smith pointed out that McGee had driven through the same intersection 30 to 40 times without incident, concluding, “The cause is that he dropped his cellphone. ”Jury called out Tesla’s use of the term “Autopilot” as misleading.Brett Schreiber argued that while other automakers use terms like “driver assist” or “copilot,” Tesla’s branding gave consumers a false sense of full autonomy, leading to over-reliance on the system.Lawyers for the family of the deceased also claimed that Tesla either hid or lost key evidence, including data and video recorded seconds before the accident.Financial analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities comments on the verdict, “It's not a good day for Tesla. It's a big number that will send shock waves to others in the industry.”The ruling marks a rare outcome in product liability litigation against Tesla. A car crash lawyer Miguel Custodio, said, “This will open the floodgates.” “It will embolden a lot of people to come to court.” Several similar lawsuits have been filed against the company in recent years, but many have been dismissed or settled before reaching trial.","Jury awards Tesla $200 million in punitive damages and $43 million in compensatory damages.

But on Thursday, Trump took aim at all indirect American imports, which he blames for part of the $1.2 trillion US trade deficit. Trump imposed 40% tariffs on so-called transshipments, which will take effect in a week. And a senior administration official who briefed reporters said work was under way that could broaden considerably the definition of indirect shipments.The new rules cover indirect shipments from anywhere, not just China. But China, with its massive factory infrastructure and expansive manufacturing ambition, has been the main country to develop a global network for such shipments. Trade experts were quick to predict that China would be the most affected - and the most annoyed.Trump's executive order Thursday created a new category of imports: goods that are transshipped through other countries instead of coming straight from the country of origin.The 40% tariffs on these goods will be on top of whatever tariffs would have applied if the goods had come directly from the country where they were originally made.The legal definition of transshipment is narrow: a good that did not undergo a ""substantial transformation"" in the country through which it was indirectly shipped. Countries in Southeast Asia have long denied that they allow a lot of transshipment. They contend that their soaring imports of Chinese components are being assembled into new and different products that can appropriately be labelled made in their countries, and not labelled ""made in China.

"India in, China out: Majority of iPhones sold in the US from India, says Apple CEO Cook",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/india-in-china-out-majority-of-iphones-sold-in-the-us-from-india-says-apple-ceo-cook/articleshow/123047653.cms,"NEW DELHI: Despite US President Donald Trump’s regular rants about Apple’s manufacturing in India, company CEO Tim Cook on Thursday confirmed what is generally now more or less known – the “majority” of iPhones sold in the US in the past quarter were Made in India. China – the erstwhile production giant – is only playing a second fiddle and is used more to service non-US markets.Cook, speaking to analysts post the company’s quarterly results, said India has been the mainstay when it comes to producing iPhones for the US, while Vietnam is the location for making other products for America such as MacBook, iPad, and Watch.“In terms of the country of origin, it's the same as I referenced last quarter. There hasn't been a change to that, which is the vast majority of the iPhone sold in the US or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin of India,” the Apple CEO said when asked about China versus India production plans.On China, Cook had this to say, “… the products for other international countries, the vast majority of them are coming from China.”While the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on India earlier this week, smartphones, computers and other electronics devices are exempted from the reciprocal tariffs for now.Trump, however, has been pushing Apple and Cook not to make the iPhones in India for meeting the needs of the US consumers. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook… I said to him, my friend, I am treating you very good… but now I hear you are building all over India. I don’t want you building in India,” he had said during his visit to Doha in May.Cook’s clear stance on India manufacturing, however, is being seen as a signal that the American electronics giant stays bullish on India, especially as the country is also consistent in showing strong growth when it comes to local sales.Cook said that revenues in India are witnessing record growth, led by the growth in sales of iPhones. India is among the high growth markets for Apple which recorded 10% growth globally in its quarterly revenues which closed the quarter at $94 billion.“We saw an acceleration of growth around the world in the vast majority of markets we track, including greater China and many emerging markets, and we had June quarter revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including the US, Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. These results were driven by double-digit growth across iPhone, Mac, and services.”The Apple CEO also said the company is in the process of expanding its retail presence in India by opening more stores.On sales, India was again amongst the high-growth countries. “We saw iPhone growth in every geographic segment and double-digit growth in emerging markets including India, the Middle East, South Asia, and Brazil.”And commenting on the global impact of US tariffs across regions (but without identifying any particular country), Cook said the “situation around tariffs is evolving.”“… so let me provide some colour there. For the June quarter, we incurred approximately $800 million of tariff-related costs. For the September quarter, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter, and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add about $1.1 billion to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters, as there are many factors that could change, including tariff rates. ”","Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that the “majority” of iPhones sold in the US in the past quarter were Made in India.

The underwhelming numbers came despite Amazon investing $31.4 billion in capital expenditure — outpacing peers — and forecasting full-year spending of $118 billion.As of 11:13 am ET, Amazon shares were trading at $215.95, down 7.76%.“The spotlight was firmly on AWS and it didn’t quite shine as brightly as expected,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, quoted Reuters. “While Microsoft and Alphabet have already shown strong momentum in cloud growth, AWS wasn’t the knockout many wanted to see.”The market reaction was swift, with Amazon’s stock falling to $216.60 in early trading, wiping out nearly $170 billion in market value.The tech giant's forward price-to-earnings ratio stood at 33.87, slightly behind Microsoft’s 34.19 but well above Alphabet’s 18.64, according to LSEG data.AWS, long seen as Amazon’s profit engine, accounted for about 60% of its operating income but saw its margins shrink to 32.9% — the lowest since Q4 2023. The company’s forecast for total operating income in the current quarter also fell short of market expectations.CEO Andy Jassy said during the earnings call that Amazon was still in the “very early days” of the AI race and that its scale would provide advantages once existing capacity constraints ease.At least 30 analysts raised their price targets for Amazon, while three lowered theirs, giving the stock a median target of $260.Even as AWS drew scrutiny, Amazon’s retail business remained a bright spot. The company reported an 11% jump in online store sales in Q2, beating estimates and showing resilience despite Trump-era tariffs. CEO Jassy said Amazon had not seen a notable rise in consumer prices or demand erosion so far this year.“If Amazon’s retail business was a standalone entity, it would be trading dramatically higher following the near-perfect results,” said Michael Morton, analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Unfortunately, as we all know, the success of the retail business is not what’s going to matter in the near term for Amazon’s stock price.”","Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue rose 17.5% in the June quarter, narrowly beating Wall Street estimates, but trailing far behind Microsoft Azure’s 39% growth.

From clothing to coffee: Trump escalates tariff war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/from-clothing-to-coffee-trump-escalates-tariff-war-whats-going-to-get-more-expensive-for-americans/articleshow/123046199.cms,"Clothes, cars and coffee to cost more



The US has slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries like China, Vietnam and Brazil, directly affecting items like apparel, coffee and vehicles.

BBC reported that clothing prices are expected to surge by up to 37%, according to Yale’s Budget Lab. Department stores such as Walmart and Target have already warned of incoming price hikes.

Coffee from Brazil now carries a 50% tariff, and Vietnamese beans face 20%, meaning daily staples could soon weigh heavier on American wallets.

While tariffs on EU and Japanese cars have been reduced to 15%, imports from the UK still face 10% levies. US-made cars relying on foreign parts are also seeing higher costs, complicating Trump’s aim to boost domestic auto production.

Canada hit hard: food, appliances and retaliation



Tariffs on Canadian exports have risen from 25% to 35%, with Canada retaliating on a wide range of US goods, including ketchup, washing machines and peanut butter, as per BBC.

Canadian grocers like Loblaw have begun labelling about 7,500 items with a “T” to indicate price hikes due to US tariffs.

Canned soups, which rely on US aluminium and steel for packaging, have seen an 8% price increase, while fruit juice prices are up 7.5%.

New and used cars in Canada have also seen price jumps of over 5%, BBC reported, as cross-border auto supply chains are hit with multiple tariffs.

Homes, beer and fuel: A ripple effect



Trump’s levies on steel, aluminium and copper are expected to increase home-building costs. The National Association of Home Builders warned: “Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices.”

Trump has floated further tariffs on lumber, impacting US housing even more. Canada supplies 69% of US lumber and is now subject to 35% duties.

Beer prices may rise due to tariffs on Mexican aluminium, affecting canned beer like Modelo and Corona. According to the Beer Institute, 64.1% of beer in the US is canned.

While European energy imports are rising under the new US-EU trade deal, Canada faces a 10% tariff on oil exports to the US. Since Canadian crude powers many US refineries, any disruption could raise fuel prices.

Canada reacts



Loopholes, uncertainty and legal challenges



President Donald Trump has pushed ahead with a sweeping set of new tariffs on imports from dozens of countries, including Canada, China and the European Union, as part of what he calls a mission to “make America GREAT & RICH Again. ” While some nations have negotiated lower rates, others are now bracing for significant increases on key exports. Consumers, meanwhile, are already beginning to feel the effects in their grocery bills, wardrobes, and housing costs.Trump insists the tariffs will bring “billions in revenue” and incentivise domestic manufacturing. But as BBC reports, critics warn that the fallout could spark inflation, worsen trade tensions, and raise prices across several sectors.Canada has sharply criticised President Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on Canadian exports not covered by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) to 35%, calling the move unjustified and harmful to vital sectors of its economy. In a statement, the Canadian government said it remained committed to CUSMA but warned that industries such as lumber, steel, aluminium and automobiles were now “heavily impacted by US duties and tariffs.Ottawa also rejected Washington’s justification linking the tariff hike to the cross-border flow of fentanyl, noting that Canada accounts for just 1% of US fentanyl imports and has significantly stepped up border security. “We will act to protect Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian, and diversify our export markets,” the statement added.According to CNN, Trump’s tariffs will apply from 7 August, but goods already in transit will be exempt if they arrive by 5 October. This loophole, however, is unlikely to ease much pressure due to fixed shipping schedules.Trump has called the tariff process “very well, very smooth,” though negotiations remain incomplete with many nations.Legal challenges are mounting. A US appeals court recently heard arguments questioning whether Trump exceeded his authority by declaring a trade “emergency” to bypass Congress.“The only things we’ll know for sure... are that growth-sapping US import taxes will be historically high and complex,” Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute told news agency AP.","The US has slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries like China, Vietnam and Brazil, directly affecting items like apparel, coffee and vehicles.

Oil earnings slip: Exxon and Chevron Q2 profit hits 4-year low; revenue dips as crude prices stay weak despite output rise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/oil-earnings-slip-exxon-and-chevron-q2-profit-hits-4-year-low-revenue-dips-as-crude-prices-stay-weak-despite-output-rise/articleshow/123045143.cms,"Exxon Mobil and Chevron on Friday reported their lowest second-quarter profits in four years, as lower global energy prices and a surge in oil supply from OPEC+ weighed on revenues. However, both US oil giants still managed to beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations, driven by higher production volumes.Texas-based Exxon Mobil posted a net profit of $7.08 billion, or $1.64 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, down from $9.24 billion, or $2.14 per share, in the same period last year. Revenue dropped to $81.51 billion from $93.06 billion, missing analyst projections of $82.82 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research, AP reporyted.Exxon does not adjust its earnings for one-time items, such as asset sales. Still, its reported profit exceeded analysts’ average forecast of $1.49 per share.“We achieved our highest second-quarter Upstream production since the merger of Exxon and Mobil more than 25 years ago,” said Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil. The company reported second-quarter net production of 4.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, up by 79,000 barrels compared to the first quarter.Chevron Corp, meanwhile, posted a net income of $2.49 billion, or $1.45 per share. Excluding special items, adjusted earnings came in at $1.77 per share, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.70. Revenue for the quarter stood at $44.82 billion, lower than expectations.The earnings decline marks a significant reversal from the boom period of 2022, when oil and gas companies posted record profits due to high energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since then, prices have eased. U.S. benchmark crude has largely traded below $70 per barrel this year and briefly dropped under $60 in May.Chevron said production in the Permian Basin reached 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter. Total US net oil-equivalent production rose by 123,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period.Chevron is also in the process of acquiring Hess Corporation for $53 billion, after securing a crucial legal clearance from a Paris court in July.The global oil market faces fresh uncertainties after eight OPEC+ members announced they would increase output by 548,000 barrels per day in August. The group cited improving global economic conditions and depleted inventories for the decision, which is expected to further pressure crude prices.While oil briefly surged in June during a 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran, it quickly dropped after the US brokered a truce and launched targeted strikes on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.The combination of geopolitical volatility and OPEC+ actions suggests energy markets could remain under pressure in the near term, despite stronger output by US producers.","Exxon Mobil posted a net profit of $7.08 billion, or $1.64 per share, for the quarter ended June 30.

Donald Trump vs Jerome Powell: US President urges Fed board to overrule Powell on rates; calls him ‘stubborn’ as dissent grows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-vs-jerome-powell-us-president-urges-fed-board-to-overrule-powell-on-rates-calls-him-stubborn-as-dissent-grows/articleshow/123045446.cms,"Photo credit- AP

US President Donald Trump on Friday called on the Federal Reserve’s board of governors to wrest control of monetary policy from Chair Jerome Powell, escalating his public campaign for deep interest rate cuts and directly attacking Powell as “stubborn. ”In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said, “If Powell doesn’t ‘substantially’ lower rates, THE BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL, AND DO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HAS TO BE DONE!”The US president, who has nominated several members to the Fed board, has repeatedly criticised Powell for maintaining the central bank’s benchmark rate — currently averaging 4.33% — even as Trump pushes for a 3 percentage point cut to stimulate growth and lower government debt costs. Powell has argued that the Fed must first assess the inflationary impact of Trump’s broad tariff regime before adjusting policy, AP reported.Two Fed governors — Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman — both dissented at the Fed’s meeting on Wednesday, issuing statements that suggested a more dovish stance. They said the recent inflation uptick was likely a one-time effect and the job market showed signs of softening.Trump seized on these internal disagreements.“STRONG DISSENTS ON FED BOARD,” Trump posted. “IT WILL ONLY GET STRONGER!”Despite claiming that the US economy is booming, Trump has repeatedly insisted that inflation is virtually nonexistent — even though the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is running at an annualised rate of 2.6%, slightly above its 2% target.Friday’s jobs report added fuel to Trump’s demands, showing only 73,000 jobs were created in July. Revisions lowered June and May figures to 19,000 and 14,000 respectively, indicating a sharper-than-expected slowdown.Trump contends aggressive rate cuts would boost growth and help homebuyers and the federal budget. But some economists warn that such steep cuts could release more liquidity than the economy can absorb, risking higher inflation.The dispute has also turned legal. A May ruling by the US Supreme Court indicated that Powell cannot be removed solely for policy differences. However, the Trump administration is reportedly exploring whether Powell can be dismissed “for cause,” citing cost overruns in the Fed’s ongoing $2.5 billion renovation project.Powell’s current term as Fed Chair ends in May 2026. Trump would then have the authority to nominate a successor, subject to Senate confirmation.",US President Donald Trump called on the Federal Reserve’s board of governors to wrest control of monetary policy from Chair Jerome Powell.

"US hiring slowdown: Economy likely added 115,000 jobs in July trailing last year's pace; grads, young workers hit hardest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-hiring-slowdown-economy-likely-added-115000-jobs-in-july-trailing-last-years-pace-grads-young-workers-hit-hardest/articleshow/123041714.cms,"AI-generated image

The US labour market is showing signs of gradual weakening, with job growth slowing even as widespread layoffs and overall unemployment stays low, according to the Assoicated Press report.Recent graduates are among the worst affected. The jobless rate for Americans aged 22–27 with a university degree rose to 5.8 per cent in March—its highest non-pandemic level since 2012—well above the national average. Meanwhile, workers more broadly appear hesitant to switch jobs, with many believing the current market reflects peak employment opportunities.That perception is gaining weight as hiring momentum wanes across most sectors, marking a sharp reversal from the post-pandemic surge when employers wooed talent with signing bonuses, flexible schedules, and even pet insurance.The latest US Labor Department employment report, due Friday (US time), is expected to show a gain of 115,000 new jobs in July, according to a FactSet survey of analysts. Though not weak, this would trail both June’s 147,000 additions and last year’s monthly trend. So far in 2024, the economy has added an average of 130,000 jobs per month- down 23 per cent from 2023 and 68 per cent below the 2021–2023 recovery period.Economists say several forces are driving this cooling: the Federal Reserve’s high interest rates to curb inflation, President Donald Trump’s newly reinstated import tariffs, and fears of declining international labour supply under looming deportation plans.“The labour market is poised for a summer slowdown as businesses put hiring plans on hold but refrain from broad-based layoffs,” Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, wrote this week, quoted by AP. “We see job growth slowing well below trend in the coming months.”Despite this, job security remains relatively strong. The national unemployment rate stands at 4.1 per cent, while unemployment benefit applications remain in a normal range.But that headline figure masks disparities. “A low unemployment rate and a muted pace of layoffs mask underlying weakness,” said Adam Schickling, senior economist at Vanguard. “The health of the job market can be a matter of perspective. If you're a nurse, prospects are excellent—the unemployment rate for experienced health care practitioners is under 2 per cent. But for young people or older workers re-entering the market, opportunities may appear scarce. ”The voluntary resignation rate—a key sign of worker confidence—has also dropped below pre-pandemic levels.Employment growth is now largely confined to a few sectors. Of the 644,000 private-sector jobs added in 2024, around 405,000- over 63 per cent- have come from healthcare and social assistance alone.Young entrants and returning workers are struggling most amid fewer openings and longer job hunts. The number of discouraged workers—those who have stopped looking because they believe no jobs are available- rose by 256,000 in June to 637,000, according to the Labor Department.“Historically, a drop in hiring has come with a spike in layoffs, a one-two punch that pushes up unemployment,” said Schickling. “Today’s labour market is defying that pattern.”Part of the explanation lies in the shrinking role of manufacturing, where companies once made sweeping headcount cuts. “There’s simply less headcount to cut,” he added.Ultimately, the job market appears to be softening—not collapsing. “Firms are pulling back on hiring without shedding existing workers in significant numbers,” Schickling noted. “The result is a gradual slowdown, not a sharp downturn.”","Recent graduates are among the worst affected.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices have been somewhat stable in the last few days, with safe haven assets being in focus even as global economic uncertainty wanes despite US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. A strong dollar has capped gains in gold. What’s the outlook for gold prices and what strategy should investors adopt in the current scenario? Here's the analysis from Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities:Gold prices have shown resilience around key support levels, with the MCX Gold August Futures currently trading around ₹97,480. The underlying tone remains cautiously optimistic, supported by a bounce from critical moving average confluence. With momentum indicators showing signs of stabilization, the intraday bias shifts towards a Buy on Dip strategy near ₹97,350, with downside risk capped around ₹96,800.1. EMA Alignment Signals Support: The 8-period EMA stands at ₹97,450, while the 21-period EMA is at ₹97,350. The price is currently testing the 21-EMA support, creating a favorable entry zone around ₹97,350. This confluence of moving averages provides a strong foundation for potential upward momentum.2. Bollinger Bands Indicate Consolidation: The Bollinger Bands show price action consolidating within the bands, with the lower band providing support near the ₹97,350 zone. This tight range suggests potential volatility expansion, favoring a breakout scenario once the accumulation phase completes.3. Pivot Point Perspective: Previous day's pivot points reveal strong support confluence around the ₹97,350 level. The price structure shows respect for these technical levels, with multiple touches confirming the zone's significance for intraday positioning.4. RSI (14) Reading: The Relative Strength Index is currently in neutral territory, suggesting room for upward movement without immediate overbought concerns. This positioning supports the buy-on-dip thesis as momentum can expand in either direction.5. MACD Momentum: The MACD indicator shows potential bullish divergence forming, with the histogram suggesting underlying strength building. This technical pattern often precedes renewed upward momentum from support zones.6. Price Structure and Volume: Recent price action shows strong buying interest near the ₹97,350 support level, with volume accumulation suggesting institutional participation. The price closing above key congestion zones confirms sustained demand at these levels.Gold intraday bias remains constructive on pullbacks. Traders can adopt a Buy on Dip strategy near the ₹97,350 mark, placing a protective stop-loss at ₹96,800. Upside targets for the session could be ₹97,800 and ₹98,200, provided the global sentiment remains supportive and prices hold above the 21-period EMA confluence.","Gold prices have shown resilience around key support levels.

Stock market recommendations:Equity benchmark indices traded sideways within a tight range, mirroring muted investor sentiment amid elevated uncertainty around the India-US trade dialogue and the onset of the Q1 FY26 earnings season. Market action remained largely stock-specific as participants adopted a wait-and-watch approach, seeking greater clarity on macroeconomic developments and corporate earnings visibility.Notably, the index has taken 12 sessions to retrace merely 50% of the preceding 11-session uptrend (from 24,473 to 25,669), reflecting a shallow pullback and signaling a healthy consolidation. This price action underscores a structurally positive setup, with the formation of a higher base around the psychological and technical support zone of 25,000, reinforcing the bullish undertone.Over the past two sessions, the index has posted near-identical intraday highs around the 25,255 marks, coinciding with the 20-day EMA—creating a critical confluence zone. A decisive breakout above this level could act as a trigger for the next leg of the uptrend, with potential upside toward the 25,600 zone in the coming weeks. Conversely, inability to convincingly surpass the 25,255 hurdles may result in continued consolidation within the 25,000–25,250 band.Amid this setup, intermittent volatility cannot be ruled out, given the overlapping headwinds from the Q1 FY26 earnings season and persistent ambiguity around India–US tariff negotiations.From a structural standpoint, the index continues to form higher highs and higher lows—demonstrating resilience in the face of geopolitical noise and policy uncertainty. Additionally, improving market internals add conviction to the bullish narrative, with 67% of Nifty 500 constituents now trading above their 200-day SMA—up significantly from 52% last month—signaling broad-based participation and lending credibility to the sustainability of the ongoing structural uptrend.Nifty has strong support between 24,900-25,100 levels which we expect to hold being the confluence of (a) the rising 50 days EMA (b) rising trendline support joining lows of May and June 2025 (c) 61.8% retracement of the previous up move (24473-25669) (d) the upper band of the recent breakout area placed around 25000 levels.Bank Nifty traded within a narrow consolidation band last week, reflecting subdued investor sentiment amid heightened uncertainty surrounding the India-US trade negotiations and ahead of the Q1 FY26 earnings season of the banking stocks.The index continues to trade above its 20-day EMA level it has consistently respected since April—signaling that the underlying bullish trend remains firmly intact. This, combined with improving market breadth, reinforces the higher high–higher low-price structure, suggesting a well-entrenched uptrend. The setup paves the way for a potential move towards the 58,500 zone in the upcoming weeks.The index on expected lines in the last 10 sessions is seen consolidating in the range 56,500-57,600. We expect the index to extend the same, and only a move beyond this range will signal the next directional move in the index.Key short-term term support is placed at 56,000–55,500 region, representing a confluence of the 50-day EMA and the key retracement level. The broader trend remains positive, and the current consolidation should be viewed as buying opportunities.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, UPL and Varun Beverages are the top stock picks for today.

The move comes after revelations that the material, which is a major component used in manufacuring electric vehicle batteries, is sold in the US at prices less than fair market value.According to a commerce department fact sheet cited by Reuters, the decision applies a single anti-dumping margin and cash deposit rate of 93.5% to all Chinese producers. The measure targets imports worth $347.1 million in 2023.The duties affect anode-grade graphite with a minimum graphite purity of 90% carbon by weight. This includes synthetic graphite, natural graphite, and combination of both.The announcement follows a separate but related investigation by the commerce department into subsidies for Chinese anode-grade graphite, which on 20 May led to preliminary countervailing duties. Most Chinese producers were hit with a rate of 6.55%, while Huzhou Kaijin New Energy Technology Corp faced a staggering 712.03%, and Shanghai Shaosheng Knitted Sweat (sic) was assigned an even higher rate of 721.03%.Final decision on both the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures are expected by 5 December 2025, as per Reuters.The cases were brought forward by the American Active Anode Material Producers, an ad hoc coalition of U.S. manufacturers.

Allianz ties up with Jio Fin after Bajaj break-up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/allianz-ties-up-with-jio-fin-after-bajaj-break-up/articleshow/122774853.cms,"-

MUMBAI: German insurance giant Allianz and Jio Financial Services have announced a 50:50 joint venture to enter India’s domestic reinsurance market. The pair also signed a non-binding term sheet for potential joint ventures in both life and general insurance. The move comes four months after Allianz ended its twodecade long joint venture with Bajaj Finserv.India’s reinsurance landscape remains relatively concentrated. GIC Re, the state-owned reinsurer, remains the sole Indian-incorporated firm in the sector. The rest, which includes global heavyweights such as Munich Re, Swiss Re and SCOR SE, operate via branches. By forming a locally incorporated reinsurance entity, Allianz and JFSL aim to embed themselves more deeply into the regulatory and commercial fabric of India’s insurance ecosystem.Jio Fin, spun off from Reliance Industries and listed just last year, is rapidly establishing itself as a fullfledged financial services group. Its businesses already spans credit, payments, leasing, insurance broking and partnerships, including a separate joint venture with BlackRock for asset and wealth management. This latest tie-up with Allianz enhances its ambition to offer a full suite of financial services.For Allianz, the pivot from Bajaj to Reliance’s financial arm suggests not just a change in partner, but a shift in strategy—from legacy joint ventures to new, digitally enabled platforms. The firm’s CEO, Oliver Bäte, said the opportunity to “democratise access to world-class financial services” across India, where Allianz seeks to be more than just a reinsurer: it wants to be a cornerstone of the country’s evolving risk management architecture.The venture, if approved, would mark the first significant reinsurance JV in India in recent memory. India is the 10th largest insurance market in the world but is expected to climb higher owing to its sustained growth. Life insurance premiums crossed Rs 8.7 lakh crore in FY25 while non-life touched nearly Rs 3.1 lakh crore.",German insurance giant Allianz and Jio Financial Services have announced a 50:50 joint venture to enter India’s domestic reinsurance market.

Wider investment basket

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi on Friday floated a consultation paper for changes to the scheme categorisation process, financial instruments into which each fund would be allowed to invest in, and if fund houses should be allowed to launch solution-oriented schemes.Sebi is also mulling allowing fund houses to launch sectoral debt funds, on the lines of sectoral equity funds.If the proposals are accepted, most of the schemes will be allowed to invest some part of their corpus in REITs and InvITs. The nomenclature of MF schemes could also see some changes with tenure of funds, like 3-5 years, 7-10 years included in the scheme names, along with the current names like medium term fund, long term fund etc.One of the proposals, according to Sebi, is to allow fund houses to offer solution-oriented life cycle fund of funds (FoFs), with a lock in, for specific goals such as retirement, housing, marriage etc. A solution oriented open-ended FoF with a target date, could have various structures, the Sebi paper said.For example, a Retirement Life Cycle FoF with the target maturity in 2055 (that is a tenure of 30 years) will remain invested in equity funds for the first 24 years, then shift the same in hybrid funds for the next three years.During the last three years of its tenure, its investments will be in debt funds.Sebi is also asking the public if such solutions-oriented life cycle FoFs should have different lock-in periods such as three years, five years, 10 years etc. “However, the said lock-in period would not be applicable to any existing investment by an investor, registered SIPs and incoming STPs in the existing solution-oriented schemes as on the date on which such scheme is getting realigned with these provisions,” Sebi said.According to Sebi, if its proposals are approved, investment objectives, investment strategies and benchmark of each scheme will be suitably modified to bring them in line with the categories of schemes.The regulator would also allow fund houses to launch an additional scheme in the existing scheme categories, provided those fund houses meet certain conditions.",Sebi is also mulling allowing fund houses to launch sectoral debt funds.

Uncertainity taking a toll

Fluctuating sentiment

MUMBAI: Geopolitical uncertainty and trade tariff jitters are weighing on hiring and new job openings in certain sectors, impacting discretionary spending by consumers across sectors ranging from apparel to auto. In the jewellery space which still has an edge given the intrinsic value gold and diamond hold, spends have been a bit better comparatively but fluctuating gold prices have hit demand in the sub Rs 50,000-1 lakh (pricing) category, said Ajoy Chawla, CEO of jewellery division at Titan.Mass markets are largely bearing the brunt of the surrounding uncertainty at least in the jewellery space; premium and luxury segments continue to fare well. “Sentiment has been subdued in the lower price points, the customer there is beginning to feel the pinch of high gold prices. “At the same time, some are going through tough times (referring to factors such as job uncertainty) ….and customerers are a bit under pressure.Many international IT/tech companies have been reducing jobs and some of that is kind of flowing back. The volatility that we have come to live with now for the past five-six quarters continues,” Chawla told TOI in an interview on the sidelines of a company event here on Friday, adding that early end of season sales being rolled out by certain firms (across industries) indicate wobbly demand.“The sentiment is not bad but it is fluctuating…uncertainty affects consumers in different ways. The greatest stress is below Rs 50,000 and 1 lakh segment in both gold and diamond,” Chawla said, pinning hopes on tax breaks to partly lift broader consumption through the course of the year.For Titan which owns brands Tanishq and Zoya, the June quarter has been decent but it could have been better, said Chawla who is set to take over as the MD of Titan from Jan 1. Consumers in the mass segment may shift to jewellery with lesser gold content and light weight items and the industry as a whole will need to innovate to boost demand in the near-term.“We are getting people used to lower caratage products in gold. We have piloted it in the North and the East and the initial response has been good. All the fundamentals of the India growth story are here. We have to stimulate demand in the short run, manage our inventory and gold prices with agility,” Chawla said.There’s also a push to bolster the trust of people in diamonds which only has a 15% penetration in India. To this end, Tanishq has partnered with De Beers Group to set up diamonds expertise centres across its stores.","Gold prices have hit demand in the sub Rs 50,000-1 lakh (pricing) category, said Ajoy Chawla, CEO of jewellery division at Titan. “Sentiment has been subdued in the lower price points, the customer there is beginning to feel the pinch of high gold prices,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122774935,imgsize-80542,width-400,resizemode-4/122774935.jpg"

MUMBAI: The US-based Viceroy Research’s report on Vedanta Group contains serious allegations, causing harm to the conglomerate’s business and reputation, former Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud has said in his legal opinion.“The elements required to establish defamation — both civil and criminal — are satisfied in this case, given that Viceroy has published public, reputationally damaging statements directly targeting the querist (Vedanta),” the former CJI said.Viceroy in a July 9 report accused Vedanta’s Londonbased parent Vedanta Resources of systematically draining the Indian-listed company. Its report, based on publicly available information, said that the entire group structure is “financially unsustainable”, operationally compromised, poses severe risks to creditors, and “resembles a Ponzi scheme”.Vedanta had dismissed the report. “The report contains serious imputations such as “Ponzi scheme” and “parasite”, which have caused harm to the querist’s (Vedanta) business and reputation. In these circumstances, the querist would be well placed to seek legal remedies,” Chandrachud said.The former CJI who had passed the final order on the Adani-Hindenburg case, further said, Viceroy’s report lacks credibility as it has a track record of taking short positions in listed companies and then publishing misleading reports to profit unlawfully from the resulting market impact.“The purported researchers behind the report have dubious credentials. Viceroy’s disclaimer that the allegations may be made to further its short-selling interests and the suspicious timing of publication further diminish the veracity of the report.”","Viceroy in a July 9 report accused Vedanta’s Londonbased parent Vedanta Resources of systematically draining the Indian-listed company.

1st entered in 1960s

MUMBAI: Reliance Retail has acquired home appliances brand Kelvinator for India from Sweden’s Electrolux as it looks to expand market share in the consumer durables space, stepping up competition against global and local giants such as Samsung and Tata’s Voltas in the market. Reliance Retail has been holding manufacturing and distribution rights for the brand in India since 2019 through a licensing deal signed with its Swedish owner.The company did not disclose the financial specifics of the deal. In an earnings update, Electrolux, however, said that it has realised a gain of about $18.5 million (around Rs 160 crore) from the divestment of the Kelvinator brand in India. Alicensing deal is typically signed for a certain period of time; a full acquisition expands a company’s scope and coverage for the brand.Kelvinator first entered India in 1960s and became popular in the local market in the 1970s and 80s before competition in the space intensified. The brand has had a chequered history in India — Whirlpool for India acquired the brand in 1995 to access the refrigerator category.Later, it went on to get acquired by Videocon in the mid 2000s, eventually being relaunched by Reliance Retail in 2019. One of Reliance’s key growth strategies has been to revive iconic brands and launch them in the market.Before Kelvinator, it has acquired homegrown brands like Campa and Velvette.Besides, Reliance Retail through its subsidiary Reliance Brands has also been building a portfolio of global labels as more consumers with higher disposable incomes seek better choices. In 2019, Reliance Brands acquired Hamleys marking the first acquisition of a global retail brand.",Kelvinator first entered India in 1960s and became popular in the local market in the 1970s and 80s.

MUMBAI: Reliance Industries, India’s largest company in terms of market value, reported a 76% increase in quarterly profit to Rs 30,681 crore on Friday, led by gains from the sale of some of its listed investments and strong growth across its key businesses.Other income surged 280% to Rs 15,119 crore due to profit (Rs 8,924 crore) on sale of its stake in Asian Paints. Excluding the Rs 8,924 crore gain, profit was higher by 25%.

AHMEDABAD: Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is likely to be inaugurated around Sep 30, and within a fortnight operations will start with 60 daily flights, reaching up to 300 in six months, Adani Group director (airports) Jeet Adani told TOI exclusively on Friday. He said the demolition of T1 at Mumbai (CSMIA) will be completed in 2029-30 once NMIA gets its second terminal, reports Saurabh Sinha. The new T1 at CSMIA will be ready by 2032.Work has started on NMIA T2 and construction will begin in 6-12 months of the new airport getting operational. He said the Adani Group has asked the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority to consider CSMIA and NMIA as one airport with common charges. When general aviation flights are shifted to Navi Mumbai next year, charters and business jets will continue to fly into CSMIA but will not be allowed to park.The much-awaited Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) will see both domestic and international flights this Oct, a week to 15 days after inauguration on or around Sep 30. Starting with 60 daily flights (30 arrivals and as many departures) in the first month, the number will double after 30 days and then reach the 240-300 mark in six months.In its first phase, with a capacity of 2 crore passengers annually (CPA), the greenfield airport will handle 400 daily flights within a year, Adani Group director (airports) Jeet Adani told TOI on Friday in an exclusive interaction.""We aim to have both domestic and international operations at NMIA from day one. If that does not happen for some reason, both will start for sure within the same month (Oct). The ratio of domestic and international flights will be 4:1 as T1 domestic capacity is 1.7 CPA and int'l is 30 LPA (lakh per annum). We have the flexibility to increase international passengers, based on demand,"" Adani said.While in its initial days connectivity may be an issue, eventually NMIA will be well-connected with a network of roads, rail, metro, air taxis and water connectivity. An aerocity is being developed that will, among other things, have hotels in all ranges from budget to luxury.""We have kept a digital first mindset at NMIA T1 with every service going to be digitally enabled from day one and the airport will be managed in a smart manner. From a consumer point of view, we will be able to give all the information in real time. Logging on to Adani One app, passengers will be able to know that their check-in bag is now on belt number so & so and we plan to do it from the day the airport gets operational. There will be no need to congregate at the belt and keep looking for one's check-in bag/s,"" Adani said.The digital footprint aims to change flyer ""anxiety to excitement"". ""What are the biggest flyer concerns? ‘Will I miss my flight? How long are the queues at various touchpoints? I forgot to pick up something for loved ones!' Scanning the boarding card will give all info on the app. So if you're able to give them information that ‘relax, your walking time to gate is exactly so many minutes or that boarding hasn't started or your aircraft hasn't even landed yet, they will be able to comfortably explore the airport',"" he said.Running both Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) and NMIA, the group has identified catchment areas for both. For people in the northern suburbs of Mumbai like Borivli, Kandivli and Virar, NMIA will be a long way off and they will continue to opt for CSMIA. ""The eastern Mumbai catchment area all the way to Pune will find NMIA perfect for them as they won't have to enter the city. South Mumbai will be equidistant from both airports,"" Adani said.","Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is likely to be inaugurated around Sep 30.

The Stabroek Block off Guyana’s coast has emerged as one of the biggest oil discoveries in recent times, propelling the South American nation to the forefront of global offshore production.Guyana, with a population of under 800,000, is expected to become the world’s fourth-largest offshore oil producer, ahead of Qatar, the US, Mexico, and Norway.“Given the significant value we’ve created in the development of the Guyana resource, we believed we had a clear duty to our investors to consider our preemption rights to protect the value we created through our innovation and hard work at a time when no one knew just how successful this venture would become,” Exxon said.The company added: “We welcome Chevron to the venture and look forward to continued industry-leading performance and value creation in Guyana for all parties involved.”Chevron’s acquisition follows Exxon’s own $60 billion move to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources, signalling intense competition among oil majors to consolidate access to strategic energy reserves.","Chevron has completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corp, securing a stake in one of the world's most lucrative oil fields.

July 2025. A packed Coldplay concert. Sixty thousand people swaying to Fix You. And then—on the stadium's Kiss Cam—two familiar-looking executives: Andy Byron , CEO of Astronomer, and Kristin Cabot, his Chief People Officer. They don’t kiss. But they don’t exactly recoil either.Within hours, the clip had gone viral. Was it an affair? A PR disaster? An HR crisis? But the more mundane—and surprisingly popular—question on Google was:What is Astronomer, and why is its CEO at a Coldplay concert with HR?Here’s the answer.Despite its celestial name, Astronomer is not a space company. It’s a tech firm that operates in the world of data orchestration. In other words, it builds the infrastructure that lets large companies move and manage their data in real time—so apps can give you accurate updates, AI models can make smart predictions, and dashboards can tell you what’s going wrong.Astronomer’s key product is a cloud-based service called Astro, which simplifies a popular open-source tool named Apache Airflow.Apache Airflow is an open-source system originally built at Airbnb. Think of it as a conductor for all the tasks in a company’s data pipeline. For example, if a firm wants to:Airflow makes sure each step runs in the right order, handles failures, retries automatically, and logs everything.It’s widely used across tech, finance, healthcare, and retail.Astronomer didn’t invent Airflow—but it has become the leading commercial company that packages, manages, and scales it for enterprises.Airflow is free, but running it reliably across a large company is not.

It offers:Companies like Apple, Stripe, Bloomberg and dozens of Fortune 500 firms now use Astronomer to manage their data pipelines.Modern businesses run on data. Whether it’s Netflix recommending your next show, a bank flagging fraud, or a health app warning about irregular heart rhythms—data needs to flow, cleanly and reliably.Astronomer ensures that happens. Without tools like Astro, companies would have to spend millions building in-house systems to handle the same problems.

"BP energy shift: Oil giant to sell US onshore wind assets to LS Power, trims $5 bn from clean push",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bp-energy-shift-oil-giant-to-sell-us-onshore-wind-assets-to-ls-power-trims-5-bn-from-clean-push/articleshow/122767989.cms,"BP has announced it will sell its entire onshore wind energy business in the United States to American firm LS Power, marking a major step in its shift away from renewables and back toward oil and gas. The sale includes 10 operational wind assets, though the deal value was not disclosed.“The onshore US wind business has great assets and fantastic people but we have concluded we are no longer the best owners to take it forward,” said William Lin, BP’s executive vice president for gas and low carbon energy, quoted AFP.Lin added that low-carbon energy will continue to have a place in BP’s simplified and more focused business model, but the company would keep rationalising its portfolio to create more value.LS Power CEO Paul Segal said the acquisition, expected to close by the end of 2025, would “help to meet growing energy demand across the US.”The move comes after BP, once seen as an industry leader in climate goals, reversed course in February by scaling back its emissions reduction targets and slashing its clean energy investments. It is now prioritising higher returns from oil and gas, under investor pressure to improve its share performance.As part of the revised strategy, BP plans to cut over $5 billion annually from clean energy spending and divest $20 billion in assets by 2027.BP's rival Shell has similarly pared back its climate ambitions in recent months.","BP to sell its entire onshore wind energy business in the United States to LS Power.

"'One of my worst appointments': Trump targets Fed Chair again, calls on 'too late, numbskull’ to lower rates",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/one-of-my-worst-appointments-trump-targets-fed-chair-again-calls-on-too-late-numbskull-to-lower-rates/articleshow/122766395.cms,"Can the president fire the fed chair?

US President Donald Trump has sharply intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of stalling the US housing market with high interest rates and hinting at possible dismissal over a controversial $2.5 billion renovation at the Fed's headquarters.In a pair of fiery Truth Social posts on Friday, Trump branded Powell a ""numbskull"" and ""one of my worst appointments,"" blaming him for keeping borrowing costs too high despite what Trump called “very low inflation” and a strong economy. ""He is truly one of my worst appointments. Sleepy Joe saw how bad he was and reappointed him anyway - And the Fed Board has done nothing to stop this “numbskull” from hurting so many people. In many ways the Board is equally to blame!"" said Trump in a post on Truth Social.“The USA is Rockin’. We deserve to be at 1%, saving one trillion dollars a year on interest costs,” Trump further added, urging Powell to “Lower the Rate, Too Late!” he added.The renewed tirade follows months of escalating tension between the White House and the independent central bank. Trump’s latest remarks go beyond monetary policy, raising questions about the legality and motivation behind the Federal Reserve’s multibillion-dollar renovation of its Washington, DC buildings.Trump has pointed to the rising cost of the project- now estimated between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion- as a possible avenue to remove Powell from office, even suggesting on Wednesday that “fraud” might be involved, reported AFP.In response, Powell sent a letter to White House budget director Russell Vought clarifying that there were no luxury features being added, such as VIP dining rooms or private elevators. He noted that the buildings required “significant structural repairs” and requested an independent review by the Fed’s inspector general.While Trump’s threats have stirred headlines, experts say removing a sitting Fed chair is far from straightforward. According to legal scholars, the president would need to show cause under federal law—such as “malfeasance,” “inefficiency,” or “neglect of duty”—to justify dismissal.“Right now, there’s no evidence that the White House has released publicly or pointed to that suggests mismanagement in connection with the renovation,” said Lev Menand, associate professor at Columbia Law School, quoted by AFP. “Based on publicly available information, there are no grounds for removing Powell ‘for cause’.”Any removal effort would require formal charges, a response from Powell, and a lengthy process that could further unsettle financial markets.Meanwhile, analysts warn that any attempt to forcibly remove Powell could trigger market volatility and shake investor confidence in the Fed’s independence. “Equities would likely sell off on impact,” said Padhraic Garvey of ING, as quoted by AFP. “This would be an effective forced exit of a reputable Fed chair by the US president, an unprecedented event for the market to get its head around,” he told AFP.However, some investors may eventually speculate that a leadership change could hasten interest rate cuts, potentially boosting stocks. But any quick monetary pivot remains uncertain, as the Federal Open Market Committee is composed of 12 voting members who independently weigh inflation and employment data.","US President Donald Trump has sharply intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Debt and shame: Why millions in China feel trapped and alone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/debt-and-shame-why-millions-in-china-feel-trapped-and-alone-despite-a-strong-economy/articleshow/122764778.cms,"TL;DR: Driving the news

China's economy grew at a 5.2% clip in Q2 2025 - faster than forecast and propped up by exports and subsidies. But a deeper look shows a troubling reality: millions of Chinese consumers are drowning in personal debt, clinging to side jobs, and quietly unraveling under financial pressure.

Many have stopped spending. Some are documenting their ruin online. Others are considering suicide.

“I can only endure. I don’t dare to quit,” Frank Huang, a 28-year-old teacher in Chongzuo, Guangxi, told Reuters. His salary hasn’t been paid in months, and he relies on his parents to survive. “If I were married with a mortgage, car loan and child, the pressure would be unimaginable.”

The government, on its part, has responded with $42 billion in subsidies and vague promises of reform. But the emotional toll is becoming as destabilizing as the economic one.

Why it matters

“In China, we generally don’t tell our parents about bad news,” Ms Bai, a former education executive whose business collapsed after the crackdown on tutoring told the Economist.

“So they were very, very affected.”

The big picture

The Chinese dream - built on homeownership, job security, and rising wealth - is cracking under pressure.

What began as a property-driven middle-class boom now looks like a debt trap:

65% of all household loans in China are mortgages, often for properties that have plummeted in value since the real estate crash.

Job insecurity is rampant, especially for younger and lower-income workers. State firms are slashing wages, and teachers are going unpaid for months.

China’s long-promised shift to a consumption-driven economy is being smothered by inaction and intimidation.

“Rather than just being short of money, people tend to compare and make choices with more consideration,” Zhan Demi, who used subsidies to upgrade her home appliances - and then immediately cut back, told the New York Times.

Between the lines: A culture of silent distress

Behind the GDP growth and flashy subsidy campaigns is a culture of silent distress.

Side hustles are survival, not ambition. Zhang Jinming, an employee at a state-run real estate firm, now delivers food every night to make up for a 24% pay cut. “There’s just no other way,” he told Reuters.

Aggressive debt collectors, known as cuigou or “pressure dogs,” bombard friends and family.

Call-blocking is futile. Harassment is constant.

Legal options are scarce.

Personal bankruptcy laws exist in theory - but only 10% of applications in Shenzhen, the only city with such a law, have been accepted since 2021.

The emotional toll is massive. Bai, the ex-entrepreneur, considered suicide after her husband divorced her and she was blacklisted from high-speed trains and hotels.

“The pay cut has put me under huge pressure. Many colleagues have resigned, and I took over their workload,” Zhang told Reuters.

Zoom in: The 'Debt IP' phenomenon

What they’re saying

In Linquan, a rural county of 1.5 million in eastern China, a teacher who gave only her surname, Yun, said she is now receiving just her basic monthly salary of 3,000 yuan, with the performance-based portion—typically about 16%—""consistently delayed."" “After I pay for gas, parking and property management fees, what’s left isn’t enough for groceries,” she told Reuters. “I feel like begging,” she added. “If it weren’t for my parents, I would starve.”

Max Zenglein, Asia-Pacific senior economist at the Conference Board of Asia, describes China as a “dual-speed economy,” marked by strong industrial output but weak consumer spending—two dynamics he says are closely linked. “Some of the economic challenges including low profitability and deflationary pressure are largely driven by continued capacity expansion in the manufacturing and technology sectors,” said Zenglein. As for the ongoing trade war with the US he added, “What’s unfolding now is coming back home as a domestic issue.”

Chinese officials are aware of the growing crisis - but they’re sending mixed signals. “We are still facing a very severe and complex situation,” Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said. “Our toolbox is plentiful, and we will be fully prepared.”

Premier Li Qiang has promised to “expand domestic demand” and “make China a megasized consumption powerhouse.”

Xi Jinping , too, has vowed to “fully unleash” consumer potential. But meaningful structural reforms - like a national personal bankruptcy law or a real welfare safety net - remain stalled.

, too, has vowed to “fully unleash” consumer potential. But meaningful structural reforms - like a national personal bankruptcy law or a real welfare safety net - remain stalled. Instead, the government is throwing money at the problem: In 2025, China doubled its subsidy pool to $42 billion, offering up to 20% off home appliances, cars, and smartphones.

That program sparked a brief consumption bump - May retail sales jumped 6.4%. But in June, growth slowed to 4.8%, disappointing expectations. Several municipalities, including Chongqing, have already paused the subsidies to avoid budget overruns.

Spending deferred, dreams deferred

The social toll of China's lopsided recovery - strong exports, weak consumption - is visible in everyday decisions:

Frank Huang, a teacher in Guangxi, hasn’t been paid in months. “If I were married with a mortgage, car loan and child, the pressure would be unimaginable,” he told Reuters.

Another teacher in Linquan says her performance bonuses are delayed. “After I pay for gas, parking and property management fees, what’s left isn’t enough for groceries,” she said.

Job seekers like Huang Tingting now face fierce competition. She quit her waitress job in April and hasn’t found another since June. “This year is worse than last year,” she said.

Even those benefiting from subsidies are cautious. Coffee is being brewed at home. Rent payments take priority over outings. And families are saving more - not spending more.

What’s next

For now, Beijing is vowing more stimulus and regulatory tightening, but consumer sentiment remains low. Zhan Demi, a mother in Tianjin, summed it up: “Many people are even unemployed, or they are forced to stop working, or their salaries are cut. Rather than just being short of money, people tend to compare and make choices with more consideration,” Zhan told the NYT.

Across cities and countryside alike, middle-class families once lauded as China’s growth engine now wrestle with mounting debt, shrinking paychecks, and the erosion of hope.Debt is no longer just an economic metric in China - it's a psychological burden reshaping the social fabric.* Over 60 million Chinese adults are in default or behind on payments, according to Gavekal Dragonomics. That’s 5–7% of the population over 15.* Household debt has skyrocketed from 11% of GDP in 2006 to over 60% in 2025, nearing rich-world levels.* Social shame around money trouble means many suffer in silence - or fall into what researchers call *shesi*, or “social death.”In a country where discussing personal failure is taboo, some are breaking the silence - for survival.A growing class of micro-influencers is monetizing personal debt on social media. They record their fall from financial grace, detail harassment from collectors, and even mock their own poor decisions.Lily, a young woman in Shanghai who films her debt struggles to make ends meet on social media, owes 30,000 yuan ($4,200) and posts short videos chronicling her situation. “I haven’t hit the big time,” she told the Economist, but others have. Popular accounts now boast hundreds of thousands of followers.“Some people are even competing: ‘Oh, I’m 10 million in debt, I’m 100 million in debt,’” Lily said.This genre - sometimes dubbed “debt IP” - is part support group, part spectacle. But it's also a cry for help that the government isn't fully addressing.A personal bankruptcy law might offer relief, but only Shenzhen has a version in place-and courts reject 90% of applications. Meanwhile, online loan sharks thrive in the legal gray zones, and structural reforms to support household consumption remain sluggish. According to Capital Economics, consumer prices fell for four consecutive months this year, a warning sign of deepening deflation.Even growth data is under question. Some analysts, like Zichun Huang at Capital Economics, estimate actual GDP growth could be closer to 3.5% for 2025-not the officially reported 5.2%.The numbers may still look strong. But for tens of millions of Chinese citizens, the story is no longer one of growth. It’s one of survival.(With inputs from agencies)","China's economy grew at a 5.2% clip in Q2 2025 - faster than forecast and propped up by exports and subsidies.

"Sanctions on Russia: EU unveils strongest measures yet; oil cap lowered, shadow fleet hit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/sanctions-on-russia-eu-unveils-strongest-measures-yet-oil-cap-lowered-shadow-fleet-hit/articleshow/122755115.cms,"The EU on Friday unveiled one of its most powerful sanctions against Russia, since the beginning of its war with Ukraine which is now in its fourth year.The sanctions include a reduced oil price cap, a ban on dealings linked to the Nord Stream gas pipelines, and fresh action against Russia’s shadow fleet of vessels, according to EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.This move comes as European nations move to buy weapons from the US to help Ukraine better defend itself.The new measures include a reduction in the oil price cap from $60 to $45 per barrel, a ban on transactions involving the Nord Stream gas pipelines, and an expansion of restrictions on Russia’s so-called shadow fleet of tankers. Over 100 additional ships have been added to the EU's blacklist.“The message is clear: Europe will not back down in its support for Ukraine. The EU will keep raising the pressure until Russia ends its war,” Kallas was qyoted as saying by AP.The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, had initially proposed the lowered oil price cap to squeeze Russia’s energy revenues, a major financial lifeline for the Kremlin. Oil income continues to underpin Russia’s economy, funding its military operations while helping President Vladimir Putin avoid domestic inflation spikes and a currency collapse.Although a $60 per barrel cap was previously imposed in 2023 by Ukraine’s Western allies, it had little practical effect at the time, as most of Moscow’s crude sold below that threshold. However, the EU sees the lowered $45 cap as a renewed attempt to dent Russian finances more substantially.The EU had sought to align the cap with the broader G7 bloc to maximise pressure, but rising global oil prices, fuelled in part by conflict in the Middle East, and the absence of support from the Trump administration hindered those efforts.In a significant step, the EU also moved to block any future revenue from the Nord Stream gas pipelines linking Russia and Germany, despite the fact they are no longer operational. The pipelines were the target of a major sabotage incident in 2022, the origins of which remain unresolved.To further tighten the financial noose, the sanctions package also targets Russia’s banking sector, aiming to limit Moscow’s ability to raise capital and carry out international transactions. Two Chinese banks were included among the entities sanctioned.Russian oil giant Rosneft’s refinery in India was also hit by the new measures, part of a broader effort to curb the Kremlin’s energy partnerships beyond Europe.Sanctions have been piling up since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. So far, over 2,400 individuals and entities, ranging from government officials and banks to companies and organisations, have faced EU asset freezes and travel bans.However, reaching agreement on each successive round of sanctions is becoming more difficult. The latest package faced opposition from Slovakia, which relies heavily on Russian gas and raised concerns about further supply cuts.The previous round of sanctions, announced on 20 May, blacklisted nearly 200 vessels suspected of helping Russia sidestep existing restrictions. With Friday’s update, more than 100 additional ships have been added to the list, signalling Europe’s intent to cut off Russia’s alternative trade routes.","The new measures include a reduction in the oil price cap from $60 to $45 per barrel.

TSMC's global expansion: Eyes Arizona as global semiconductor hub; planning to establish a global gigafab cluster,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tsmcs-global-expansion-eyes-arizona-as-global-semiconductor-hub-planning-to-establish-a-global-gigafab-cluster/articleshow/122740562.cms,"Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC is accelerating its US expansion, stepping up the construction of its second and third chip fabrication plants in Arizona as part of plans to build a massive “gigafab” cluster in the state, as per a report by Focus Taiwan.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) is advancing its strategy to meet increasing global demand for advanced semiconductors used in smartphones, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-performance computing (HPC).At an investor conference on Thursday, TSMC chairman CC Wei highlighted Arizona’s growing strategic importance within the company’s global operations. He said the state is set to become a critical hub for TSMC’s most advanced manufacturing technologies.The company’s first Arizona fab began mass production in the fourth quarter of 2024, using 4-nanometre process technology. Wei further stated that the facility’s yield rate is already on par with TSMC’s similar fabs in Taiwan.Construction of the second Arizona fab, which will produce 3nm chips, the most advanced node currently deployed in Taiwan, has been completed. Due to strong customer demand, production is now scheduled to commence several quarters ahead of the original timeline.Meanwhile, groundwork has begun for a third fab in the state, which will use 2nm and A16 process technologies. Wei confirmed that demand for AI-related chips remains particularly robust.TSMC’s total investment across the three Arizona fabs stands at $65 billion. The company has also pledged an additional $100 billion over the next few years to deepen its US presence. This includes plans for three more fabs, two integrated circuit (IC) assembly plants, and a dedicated research and development centre.These projects are expected to transform Arizona into a self-sustaining semiconductor manufacturing hub, with the state’s facilities eventually accounting for roughly 30% of TSMC’s most advanced chip production, those using 2nm and newer technologies.TSMC’s global expansion plans extend beyond the US. In Japan, its first fab in Kumamoto began mass production in late 2024, producing chips using 12nm, 16nm, and 28nm processes. A second fab, originally scheduled to break ground in early 2025 and begin operations in late 2027, will manufacture 6nm, 7nm, and 40nm chips.However, Wei noted a slight delay in the project due to traffic infrastructure issues. Construction is now expected to start later this year, depending on local progress.In Germany, TSMC is also progressing smoothly with the construction of a fabrication facility in Dresden, which will focus on specialty semiconductor technologies.Back in Taiwan, the company continues its major domestic expansion. It plans to build 11 new wafer fabs and four advanced IC assembly facilities over the coming years. Current projects in Hsinchu and Kaohsiung are scheduled to begin mass production using 2nm process technology later this year.Despite the ambitious overseas expansion, TSMC’s chief financial officer Wendell Huang cautioned that the company will face short-term financial pressures. He projected a 2–3 percentage point dip in gross margins initially, with a broader 3–4 percentage point decline expected over the next five years due to the higher operating costs associated with international sites.","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Donald Trump's environmental rollback: Provides regulatory relief to coal-fired plants; reverses Biden era rules to 'national security',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-environmental-rollback-provides-regulatory-relief-to-coal-fired-plants-reverses-biden-era-rules-to-national-security/articleshow/122714749.cms,"US President Donald Trump is planning to reverse environmental regulations introduced during the Biden administration, announcing two years of regulatory relief for coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other industrial polluters.The decision, framed as a national security measure, was revealed through a series of presidential proclamations issued late on Thursday.The exemptions apply to a broad range of facilities, including taconite iron ore processors critical to steel production, and chemical manufacturers involved in making semiconductors and sterilising medical devices. These industries will now be permitted to comply with older Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards that were in effect prior to the Biden-era rules, the White House confirmed.Trump criticised the regulations imposed under President Joe Biden as prohibitively expensive and, in some cases, impossible to meet. A White House fact sheet claimed the exemptions would allow “critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs.”During his previous term, Trump’s EPA had already granted waivers to numerous coal-fired plants, citing similar reasons.The agency also gave polluting industries a chance to apply for relief from rules aimed at limiting emissions of hazardous chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. To streamline the process, the EPA introduced a dedicated email system that companies could use to seek presidential exemptions under the Clean Air Act.Environmental groups have strongly condemned the move, branding the new EPA contact point a “polluters’ portal” that could enable widespread avoidance of environmental laws. Advocates warned of the dangers associated with exposure to toxic substances, especially mercury, which can lead to brain damage in children and birth defects in unborn babies.Industry associations representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical firms quickly mobilised to request blanket exemptions from federal pollution controls. Under the Clean Air Act, the president has authority to grant such temporary exemptions if required technologies are not broadly available and the exemptions serve national security interests.Back in April, the EPA granted 70 coal-fired plants a two-year reprieve from federal mandates targeting toxic emissions. According to a list published on the agency’s website, 47 power providers operating at least 66 coal plants have already received exemptions from Biden-era regulations.In a broader push, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in March an ambitious plan to repeal dozens of major environmental regulations covering air, water and climate protections. Zeldin hailed the move as the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”However, news agency AP warned of the potential consequences. as the targeted regulations could have prevented an estimated 30,000 deaths and saved $275 billion annually.“Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help ... unleash American energy,"" Zeldin said.","US President Donald Trump is planning to reverse environmental regulations introduced during the Biden administration.

Tata-owned Jaguar Land Rover to reduce 500 management jobs in UK as profit falls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tata-owned-jaguar-land-rover-to-reduce-500-management-jobs-in-uk-as-profit-falls/articleshow/122706876.cms,"Jaguar Land Rover

Tata-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is to cut 500 management jobs in Britain in the wake of US tariffs and a fall in profits. On July 7 the carmaker revealed that its retail sales had plunged in three months to June 30, 2025 by 15.1% and wholesale sales were down 10.7% year-on-year.This largely reflects the planned wind down of legacy Jaguar models, ahead of the launch of new Jaguar, and a pause in shipments to the US in April 2025, following the introduction of US import tariffs, JLR said. The carmaker has largely stopped selling its Jaguar vehicles as it relaunches the brand, ahead of unveiling a new portfolio of luxury electric cars.It faced a public backlash over its controversial rebrand last year after it released a video showing models and no cars, leading to derision from Elon Musk and criticism from Nigel Farage who called it “woke.”In March US president Donald Trump announced that UK auto exports to the US faced an extra 25% tax, on top of an existing 2.5% levy. This led to JLR pausing shipments of its vehicles to the US in April. The Defender, made in Slovakia, still faces a 27.5% tariff.A JLR spokesperson told TOI: “We often offer eligible employees voluntary redundancy so this is no different to normal practice. These job losses are specific to the UK and will affect up to 500 management roles, which is only 1.5% of our UK workforce. Through this limited programme for managers, JLR is aligning its leadership workforce for the business’s current and future needs.

US solar manufacturing and inflation reduction act



Next steps: Commerce department review



A coalition of leading US solar panel manufacturers has filed a formal petition urging the US commerce department to impose tariffs on solar imports from India, Indonesia, and Laos.The group alleges that producers in these countries are flooding the American market with artificially low-priced solar panels, harming the domestic solar manufacturing industry.According to a Reuters report, the petition, submitted on Thursday by the Alliance for American Solar Manufacturing and Trade, includes major industry players such as First Solar, Qcells (Hanwha’s solar division), Talon PV, and Mission Solar. The alliance claims companies in the three countries are selling solar products below production costs and are benefiting from unfair government subsidies.According to the petitioners, Chinese-owned manufacturers have shifted operations to Indonesia and Laos to circumvent existing US tariffs on imports from other Southeast Asian countries. Indian manufacturers are also accused of dumping low-cost panels into the US market.The group highlighted a dramatic rise in solar imports from India, Indonesia, and Laos — jumping from $289 million in 2022 to $1.6 billion in 2023. The surge has raised concerns among US solar producers about the impact on recent investments aimed at boosting domestic solar manufacturing.""We have always said, vigorous enforcement of our trade laws is critical to the success of this industry,” said Tim Brightbill, lead attorney for the petitioners.While the majority of solar panels installed in the US are still imported, American manufacturing capacity has expanded significantly since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. The law provides tax credits to boost domestic clean energy production and reduce dependence on Chinese-made solar panels.The US now has around 50 gigawatts of solar panel production capacity, up from 7 GW in 2020. However, demand continues to outpace supply, with installations expected to reach nearly 43 GW annually through 2030, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).The US department of commerce has 20 days to decide whether to launch an investigation into the alleged dumping and subsidy practices. If it proceeds, the case could lead to new tariffs within a year, depending on the outcome of the investigation.","A coalition of leading US solar panel manufacturers has filed a formal petition urging the US commerce department to impose tariffs on solar imports from India, Indonesia, and Laos.

Byju’s goes to war: $2.5 billion lawsuit brewing against Glas Trust; here’s what the matter is about,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/byjus-goes-to-war-2-5-billion-lawsuit-brewing-against-glas-trust-heres-what-the-matter-is-about/articleshow/122667085.cms,"Representative image

Byju's founders Byju Raveendran and Divya Gokulnath are preparing a $2.5 billion lawsuit in India and overseas as the edtech giant battles insolvency proceedings and a legal dispute with Glas Trust, trustee for Term Loan B lenders.According to their legal counsel, the planned legal action will be pursued both in India and internationally, targeting those who have allegedly harmed their reputation and business interests, including their edtech company Think & Learn.In a statement issued on Thursday by Lazareff Le Bars Eurl, Senior Litigation Advisor J Michael McNutt said, ""Byju's founders reserve all rights to bring actions against those parties that have caused damage to them personally and their businesses, including Think & Learn. The conduct before the Courts by Alpha, Glas Trust and its counsel has been reprehensible and improper in our view. We reserve the right to use all legal means to obtain justice for Byju's founders. ”Glas Trust is the trustee representing lenders to whom Byju's owes $1.2 billion. However, the founders have contested the trustee’s claims and challenged its authority. According to them, Glas Trust only represents 17.38% of the voting rights of the consortium of lenders.The founders have already filed claims in India against Glas Trust and a former subsidiary of Think & Learn, which Glas now claims to control. Additional legal action is also being prepared in other jurisdictions. The lawsuits are expected to seek damages of no less than $2.5 billion.Byju's is currently undergoing insolvency proceedings initiated by Glas Trust. Though the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had earlier dismissed the case in an appeal filed by the BCCI, Glas Trust approached the Supreme Court, which allowed the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) to continue.Byju's founders are contesting the insolvency case and have filed a plea seeking the removal of the Interim Resolution Professional, alleging a conflict of interest due to links with consultancy firm EY, which is also connected to Glas Trust.Meanwhile, Glas Trust has gained control of Byju's Alpha, a special-purpose financing vehicle created to receive Term Loan B funds. Byju's Alpha has filed a lawsuit against Raveendran, Gokulnath, and senior executive Anita Kishore, accusing them of executing a scheme to hide and misappropriate $533 million of loan proceeds.The founders’ counsel has clarified that no court, either in India or the US, has ordered the payment of any amount by Raveendran or Gokulnath to Think & Learn or its affiliates.Raveendran is currently involved in legal proceedings in a Delaware court, which began in April 2025, but has challenged the court’s jurisdiction. He has denied all allegations and is actively defending himself. He is also seeking reconsideration of a civil contempt order issued on July 7, 2025, related to the disclosure of certain information, which he claims is already under review in Indian courts.""That Civil Contempt Order concerns requests for information that are duplicative of matters already before the Indian Courts. Byju and his counsel are addressing those matters before the Indian Courts as well. Byju and his counsel are evaluating how to address that Order and reserve all rights,"" the statement said.","Byju's founders Byju Raveendran and Divya Gokulnath are preparing a $2.5 billion lawsuit in India and overseas.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

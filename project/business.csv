Stock market recommendations:Trent surpassed the milestone of 1,000 fashion stores for FY25, reaching a total of 757 Zudio stores—an increase of 39%—and 248 Westside stores, marking 6% growth. In the March 2025 quarter alone, 122 new Zudio stores were added. Trent’s industry-leading growth, driven by healthy SSSG, store productivity, and robust footprint additions, along with the scale-up of Zudio and newer categories, offers a huge runway for growth over the next few years. TRENT’s focus on ramping up Star through Fresh and its own brands provides an additional growth driver in the grocery segment. We estimate a revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 32%/34%/39% over FY24-27, driven by 21% CAGR in area additions & mid-single-digit improvement in productivity.HDFC Bank is effectively addressing post-merger challenges (high CD ratio, costly borrowings) through robust deposit mobilization (+15% CAGR FY25-27E) and portfolio rebalancing toward high-yielding Retail/Commercial & Rural Banking loans (~11% CAGR). NIMs (3.43% in 3QFY25) are poised to expand to 3.5-3.6% by FY27 as funding costs ease, supported by a rising CASA mix. Prudent asset quality (GNPA/NNPA: 1.4%/0.4%) and a hefty INR262b provision buffer mitigate risks. Operational streamlining (cost-to-income: ~40% by FY27) and margin recovery underpin RoA/RoE targets of 1.8%/14.1%.","According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting April 7, 2025) are Trent and HDFC Bank.

"Long & short: Don't panic, don't be greedy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/long-short-dont-panic-dont-be-greedy/articleshow/120080098.cms,"MUMBAI: Investors, jittery about the present market situation, should not act out of fear, emotion or greed: This is the advice to them by people with decades of experience in the market.According to Mukund Seshadri, partner, MSVFP LLP, during any sudden and major change in the market, like Covid, US market turmoil, the current tariff war, there's a high chance for investors to react immediately. ""Investors should avoid such knee jerk reactions to market-related events,"" Seshadri said. ""Usually the markets are volatile in the short term but to make money in the market, investors should have a long-term view,"" he said.Market players remind investors of the old saying: It's not the 'timing the market' that makes money for investors. It's the 'time in the market' that creates wealth for investors. Fund managers and financial advisors said investors with a financial plan for the long run, should stick to their asset allocation plan. Just because the markets are volatile, they should not react to it and change their asset allocation plan.So where should investors with some funds in hands should invest. According to Prahant Jain, founder & CIO, 3P Investment Managers, in the current fall in the market, one should buy large caps. On the other hand, he says investors should avoid small and midcap stocks since most of those stocks still look very expensive, and risk-reward is not favourable.Jain, who was the first fund manager in India to manage Rs 1 lakh crore worth of money across equity funds, listed several reasons for buying large caps. According to him, Indian goods exports to the US are only 2% of the country's GDP, a small share compared to many other countries. The duty differential with India's key competitors in goods exports, like China and Vietnam, has increased, putting India at an advantageous position.Secondly, oil prices and US yields have fallen sharply. This is a material positive for India. Also given the volatile market conditions, companies taping the primary market for funds will not go there. So, the supply of stocks in that market will dry up, Jain said.Since the US markets__a favoured destination for global investors to put money for the last few years-is now underperforming other markets sharply. This should lead to realignment of capital flows with India coming out to be a potential beneficiary.Jain also thinks local fund flows will hold steady and should get deployed in the secondary markets, mostly in large cap stocks . While those who have funds can invest wisely, those who have recently come to the market and have never seen a bear phase, should reach out to an experienced advisor for help, rather than selling out, financial advisors said. Advisors can handhold such new investors to sail through the current rough phase, they said.","Investors, jittery about the present market situation, should not act out of fear, emotion or greed.

"Trump's tariffs: Larger the US business, bigger the stock hit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-tariff-larger-the-us-business-bigger-the-stock-hit/articleshow/120078506.cms,"MUMBAI: Stocks of companies with large exposure to the US market are being sold aggressively by investors as market players fears about a recession in the world's largest economy and slowdown in businesses globally grows. Economists and market strategists believe that the high import tariffs by the US could prompt other countries to retaliate with similar measures, which in turn could lead to a global slowdown in production, hurting almost every country.In the Indian market, companies from sectors like auto & auto parts, metals, software, pharma, textiles, and gems & jewellery have seen their stock prices slid sharply.Among leading conglomerates, Tata Group, with a large exposure to the US market, has seen its aggregate market capitalisation dip the most since the new tariff proposals were announced late on April 2. The group's market cap is down by about Rs 2.4 lakh crore to Rs 25.5 lakh crore. This is followed by Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries group, which has lost about Rs 1.3 lakh crore worth of market value.Among Tata Group companies, flagship TCS's market cap has fallen by about Rs 97,100 crore; Tata Motors, which has a large exposure to the US market through its international arm JLR, has lost about Rs 33,800 crore worth of market value. The current selloff in IT exporters is mainly on the back of fears that a slowdown in the US, which is the biggest market for software exports , could hit their income and profit. The biggest market cap loss among companies has been in Reliance Industries (Rs 1.1 lakh crore).Among metals companies, Tata Steel has lost nearly Rs 31,300 crore worth of market cap while Hindalco has lost about Rs 22,200 crore worth of market value. Metal stocks are down on fears that a global recession or a slowdown would substantially curtail demand for metals, sector analysts said. In Monday's market, six of the 30 sensex constituents hit 52-week low levels: Infosys, L&T, RIL, Tata Motors, TCS and Titan. And among BSE 100 constituents, as many as 22 stocks hit 52-week low levels.","Tata Group, with a large exposure to the US market, has seen its aggregate market capitalisation dip the most.

Stock market today : BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, rallied strongly in opening trade on Tuesday a day after the terrible stock market crash. While BSE Sensex went above 74,300, Nifty50 was above 22,500. At 9:40 AM, BSE Sensex was trading at 74,163.30, up 1,025 points or 1.40%. Nifty50 was at 22,472.05, up 310 points or 1.40%.The Indian stock markets have undergone a significant decline, largely due to worldwide market disruption caused by retaliatory trade tariffs. Market experts indicate that current year's unprecedented market lows have led investors to exercise increased caution whilst dealing with these difficult market conditions.Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services says, “The heightened uncertainty and volatility that has gripped markets worldwide will linger for some more time. There are some significant takeaways from the ongoing chaos. One, the trade war is like to be confined to US and China. Others including EU and Japan have opted for negotiations. India has already started negotiations on a BTA with US. Two, the risk of a recession in the US has increased. Three, China is likely to be the worst-hit economy. Trump’s threat of another 50% tariff on China will, if carried out, almost freeze Chinese exports to US. Four, China will try to dump its products like metals in other countries, and this will keep international metal prices depressed.""Investors may continue in wait and watch mode since it will take time for clarity to emerge. However, since India’s macros are stable and we can grow at around 6% in FY26 and the valuations are fair particularly in largecaps, long-term investors can start nibbling at high quality largecaps like the leading financials. Since Trump is unlikely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals at this stage, pharma stocks, which are attractively priced now, appear to be good buys,"" he adds.The aggregate market capitalisation of NSE-listed firms has declined by $280 billion across three trading sessions following the U.S. tariff announcement.On Monday, foreign institutional investors offloaded Indian equities worth $1.05 billion, marking the largest single-day withdrawal since February 28.""The current investor sentiment is characterised by uncertainty and fear, and it will persist till the time a new normal for global trade is established,"" Shiv Chanani, fund manager of equity at Baroda BNP Paribas Mutual Fund told Reuters, whilst acknowledging that Indian equities may experience a recovery.US markets showed mixed trends on Monday after volatile trading, with concerns about economic slowdown, recession and increasing inflation.

The Big Global Recession &

Stagflation

Risk

Several major investment banks have raised the probability of a US and global recession with the trade war creating an environment of uncertainty. JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have raised the likelihood of US recession further.

Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs and retaliations from major economies like China may fuel inflation globally, while also leading to a major economic slowdown, which may ultimately lead to a recession, fear experts.

The ripple effect of high inflation and stagnating growth or economic contraction may be extremely painful for the world economy, experts warn.

According to a Bloomberg report, BlackRock Inc.'s Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink has said that numerous CEOs that he is in touch with believe the US has entered a recession, cautioning that equity markets might experience further downturns due to President Donald Trump's trade policies disrupting global economic stability.

""The economy is weakening as we speak,"" Fink, 72, said during an interview on Monday at the Economic Club of New York, whilst predicting additional economic deceleration in the upcoming months.

Fink has expressed scepticism about multiple Federal Reserve rate reductions this year, suggesting that inflation rates would likely remain high.

Following Wednesday's tariff announcement, the S&P 500 experienced a substantial decline of 10.5% across two trading sessions, resulting in a market value fall of nearly $5 trillion. This represents the steepest two-day decline since March 2020. The index continued its downward trend on Monday with a 0.23% decrease.

The Trump administration seems largely unconcerned about the US market rout. ""Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump has said.

""The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done decades ago. Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a Panican (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!"" he said on social media.

Indian Markets in ‘unknown’ territory, but there’s a silver lining

What has US President Donald Trump unleashed on the world economy? That’s the question in the minds of global market experts and economists as the world enters a period of heightened volatility and uncertainty due to Trump’s reciprocal tariffs and the possibility of a trade war due to retaliatory measures by other countries.China has already announced 34% tariffs as a counter - a step that Trump has warned may invite another 50% tariffs on the world’s second largest economy.Asian financial markets experienced sharp declines on Monday, following the significant crash on Wall Street in the previous week. Trump maintained his stance on comprehensive import tariffs affecting most nations, stating he would continue unless countries balanced their trade relationships with the U.S.The Japanese market witnessed severe turbulence, with the Nikkei 225 index recording an initial decline of nearly 8% at opening. By midday, the index stabilised at a 6% decrease. Other regional markets showed substantial losses, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng falling 9.4%, whilst the Shanghai Composite declined 6.2%, and South Korea's Kospi reduced by 4.1%.Indian stock markets have not been spared either. BSE Sensex and Nifty50 crashed around 5% in trade on Monday, before making a smart recovery in the last hour of trading.Also Read | Stock market crash: What’s the road ahead for Sensex, Nifty? Top 5 reasons investors shouldn’t panic about short-term ‘noise’ due to Trump tariffs Market analysts indicate that this year’s unprecedented market decline has compelled investors to exercise heightened caution whilst dealing with the present difficult conditions.The current stock market downward trend in India stems primarily from the widespread weakness observed across global markets, significantly impacting investor confidence.""However, any signs of stabilization or improvement on the global front are likely to ignite a powerful recovery in the Indian markets, revitalizing confidence and sparking renewed optimism among market participants,"" said Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst, Angel One.The day's sell-off left investors poorer by Rs 14.2 lakh crore with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 389.3 lakh crore.The April 7, 2025 crash in the Indian stock markets is the third biggest market cap loss in a single day. It’s also the sixth biggest single-day crash on the BSE Sensex in terms of points.Investors are heavily offloading shares of companies that have substantial business interests in the US, as concerns mount over a potential recession in the largest economy and a worldwide business slowdownIn India's stock market, share prices have declined considerably across various sectors including automobile and components, metal manufacturing, information technology, pharmaceutical, textile manufacturing, and precious stones & ornaments.Among major business houses, the Tata Group, which has significant US market presence, has witnessed the largest decline in total market value since the fresh tariff proposals were announced late on April 2. The group's market capitalisation has reduced by approximately Rs 2.4 lakh crore to Rs 25.5 lakh crore. The Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries group follows with a market value reduction of about Rs 1.3 lakh crore.The market decline on Monday was primarily driven by overseas investors who offloaded shares valued at Rs 9,040 crore. Foreign institutional investors withdrew more than Rs 9,000 crore ($1.04 billion) from Indian equity markets, marking the second-largest divestment of Indian shares by value in the current year.In contrast, domestic institutional investors demonstrated confidence by making net purchases amounting to Rs 12,122 crore.Also Read | Will Nifty follow Nasdaq into the bear market zone? Stock market crash a direct echo of Wall Street bloodbath Top fund managers and strategists said world markets were in unknown territory, and hence risks are high. However, they said given India's small share in global trade, the impact could be limited.Narendra Solanki, who leads Fundamental Research - Investment Services at Anand Rathi Shares, expresses a positive long-term perspective regarding the Indian economy He maintains a 12-month target of 26,000 for Nifty50. Recent market volatility has emerged following the tariff announcement by former US President Donald Trump, raising concerns about global trade patterns and capital movements.However, he considers this disruption to be temporary. Whilst these short-term disturbances may temporarily affect investor confidence, corporate earnings visibility and asset price returns, they are unlikely to impede India's fundamental growth trajectory, he told TOI.In today's unpredictable global environment, India maintains a relatively protected and insulated position, according to A Balasubramanian, MD & CEO, Aditya Birla Mutual Fund.""India's domestic fundamentals remain strong, with a large economy and minimal direct impact from the tariff changes. Additionally, falling oil prices could help reduce inflation, potentially leading to rate cuts that would support growth.""India's resilience against worldwide disruptions stems from its robust internal economic framework, whilst policymakers actively implement stabilising measures and ensure effective policy execution, he indicated.Also Read | Warren Buffett defies market trend!

IT firms to tighten belts amid rising uncertainty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/it-firms-to-tighten-belts-amid-rising-uncertainty/articleshow/120079225.cms,"BENGALURU: Doing more for less is regaining traction in the IT sector. Indian IT firms are grappling with volatility and bearish sentiment amidst a widespread stock market rout . Infosys and HCLTech stock prices declined by nearly 4% on Monday, while Cognizant and Accenture dropped 4% and 2% respectively in early trade on Nasdaq. US remains the largest revenue-contributing geography for large IT firms, accounting for over 50% of industry revenue. The IT index declined approximately 20% year-to-date, indicating elevated uncertainty stemming from Trump's reciprocal tariffs. IT companies were hopeful of some recovery in discretionary spending, but the current scenario will further push the recovery cycle.Incred Equities, in its research note, said the recent uncertainty and lack of urgency to spend could potentially moderate spending pattern and, in turn, heighten call for 'doing more for less'.""This implies vendors need to optimise existing projects to fund discretionary/AI or AI-led data projects.""Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, said that the focus of most US businesses is going to be squarely on cost reduction , and this will have a direct impact on the global IT and BPO services industry. ""IT services and advisory firms will need to act quickly to address these consumer impacts by getting into war room footing with companies to seek out where manufacturing and imports that are tariffed less can be moved.""He said that IT firms must come up with strategies to help firms switch from innovation and growth models to responsible cost management and workforce realignment. ""There will be no free trade zones. This won't withstand the changing economics of this new world order, but it may allow savvy firms to help their customers shore up contracts and services needed to deliver goods as they lean out their operations,"" he added.Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and chairman of IT advisory Everest Group, said the impact of tariffs on the US and global economy is significant and it is causing widespread uncertainty and a pull-back in investment. ""This in turn is affecting discretionary IT spending which is affecting growth.""He believes focusing on cost savings and investing in non-US markets seems to have more upside currently.","Infosys and HCLTech stock prices declined by nearly 4% on Monday.

MUMBAI: Commerce minister Piyush Goyal blamed the present state of affairs on tariffs, on the world turning a blind eye to unfair trade practices adopted by China for over two decades after its admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001, driven by the narrative of low-cost manufacturing and cheap goods. He urged the world to act collectively to restore fair trade practices to preserve multilateral trade.He called upon India to turn the tariff crisis into an opportunity just like the country did during the Y2K (year 2000 IT transition) and Covid challenges. He also called upon Indian companies to be nationalistic and collaborate to support downstream and upstream players and align with national goals.Speaking at an India Global Forum event in Mumbai, Goyal said that despite Monday's stock market crash, India, with a 3% decline, was at the bottom of the list of countries ranked by fall in key indices with others having declined as much as 9%.Goyal said Trump's tariff war was a culmination of decades of imbalances which began with China gaining entry into the WTO and growing by leaps and bounds. ""But what everybody closed their eyes to was that this growth was fuelled by unfair trade practices. This growth happened at the cost of fair play. Its foundation lay in actions which, by the rules of the game, would be considered improper,"" said Goyal.""The current state of play, in some way, is a culmination of almost three decades of this attack on several economies. And because we played by the rules of the game-because India remained true to our commitments at the WTO, as did most other well-meaning countries-we saw, starting from there, an era of unprecedented damage to national economies, to the manufacturing ecosystem in large parts of the world,"" said Goyal. ""Many parts of the world was convinced China would reform itself-would transform its processes, bring transparency into its economy, and work on fair terms in the global economy"".", Commerce minister Piyush Goyal blamed the present state of affairs on tariffs.

What does Elon Musk think of Trump tariff?



As Tesla's stock reached a new low Monday, investors revisited what Donald Trump 's commerce secretary Howard Lutnick commented about Tesla stock a month ago. Last month, Tesla stock plummeted owing to the global protest against Elon Musk because of his influence in the Trump administration. Thousands of Tesla vehicles were set on fire in a global Tesla Takedown program. At that time, Lutnock said Tesla shares would not go down below this point and hence everyone should buy Tesla shares. But on Monday Tesla shares dropped to $214.80 down from $235.86 when Lutnick made his remarks.“I think if you want to learn something on this show tonight, it’s buy Tesla,” Lutnick told on Fox in March, urging viewers to put their money in the company of a Trump administration employee.“It’s unbelievable that this guy’s stock is this cheap,"" Lutnick said and added that Muyis the best person to bet on.The value of Tesla opened at $223 per share on Monday. It vascillated throughout the morning, rising to about $244 per share by 10:15 a.m. By 11:30 a.m., it had dropped back down to $225 per share and remained around $227 per share by noon. By 1 p.m. ET, it had leveled out at about $228 per share.Elon Musk has distanced from Trump's tariff and publicly countered Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro, calling for zero-tariff deal with Europe. “A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing,” Musk wrote about Navarro reacting to a post on X.Musk then pitched for a zero-tariff situation between the US and Europe, though Trump has imposed a 20 per cent tariff on the European Union. “I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America,” Musk said.Navarro reacted to Musk's comments and said Musk is speaking as a car-seller as his business interest has been hurt. “The thing that I think is important about Elon to understand is he sells cars. That’s what he does,” Navarro said.","The value of Tesla opened at $223 per share on Monday.

Bank US recession odds after tariffs US recession odds before tariffs JP Morgan 60% 40% Goldman Sachs 45% 35% S&P Global

30-35% 25% HSBC 40% -

Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast for the likelihood of a US recession to 45%, up from 35%, marking the second time in a week the investment bank has increased its odds amid growing concerns over the trade war. This adjustment follows heightened fears that tariffs proposed by US President Donald Trump could significantly disrupt the global economy.Goldman had initially raised its recession probability from 20% to 35% last week due to concerns that Trump’s planned tariffs would create a major economic shock. However, after Trump announced even steeper-than-expected tariffs, global markets experienced a selloff, prompting further revisions to the forecast, according to news agency Reuters.At least seven major investment banks have followed suit in raising their recession risk predictions. Notably, JP Morgan now estimates a 60% chance of both a US and global recession, warning that the tariffs will likely not only increase US inflation but could also provoke retaliatory actions from other nations, particularly China, which has already imposed tariffs on US goods.Goldman Sachs also revised its US economic growth outlook for 2025, lowering it to 1.3% from 1.5%. This revision is still more optimistic than Wells Fargo Investment Institute's (WFII) forecast of 1% growth. Meanwhile, JP Morgan has taken a more pessimistic view, forecasting a 0.3% contraction on a quarterly basis.On the other hand, Morgan Stanley noted in a Sunday report that while a recession is not included in their base case, it has become a “realistic bear case” given the current economic uncertainties, as per Reuters.Goldman Sachs now expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in June, earlier than previously anticipated, with a 25 basis point reduction in three consecutive meetings. The bank had initially forecast the first rate cut to occur in July.JP Morgan now predicts rate cuts in each of the Fed meetings in 2025, starting in June, with a further cut in January, bringing the upper bound of the policy rate to 3%. It had previously expected the Fed to lower rates twice this year, from the current range of 4.25% to 4.50%.Meanwhile, WFII has revised its forecast and now expects three rate cuts this year, up from one. According to data from LSEG, traders are currently expecting 116 basis points of rate cuts this year, signalling that the Fed may reduce rates in at least four of its remaining five meetings.Here’s a breakdown of US recession odds before and after Trump’s tariff announcements, as reported by Reuters:","Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast for the likelihood of a US recession to 45%, up from 35%.

Recession risks

Global bond yields have dropped sharply following US President Donald Trump 's tariff announcement last Wednesday, as investors flock to safe havens amid stock market turmoil.According to CNBC, Germany's 10-year bund --the benchmark for the euro area -- saw a decrease from 2.72% on Wednesday to 2.59% by Monday afternoon. Just last month, the yield had spiked above 2.9%, as markets anticipated a fiscal spending boost in Europe’s largest economy. With lower yields indicating stronger demand for government debt, the shift suggests a rush to safer assets in uncertain times.Analysts from Rabobank noted, “The Bund rally is unwinding the region-wide tightening of financial conditions.” They added that even if Trump were to reverse his tariff stance, it might mitigate market panic temporarily, but would not prevent a slowdown due to the unpredictability of the policy environment.Across the Atlantic, the US 2-year Treasury yield fell to its lowest level since September 2022, nearing 3.58%. Similarly, Japan's 10-year bond yield reached a three-month low after experiencing its largest weekly decline since 1998, as per CNBC report. Investors are grappling with the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s unpredictable tariff policy, pondering whether it could trigger a global growth slowdown or even a US recession.Susannah Streeter from Hargreaves Lansdown highlighted, “The big flight to cash continues as investors seek a shelter for their money amid the tariff storm.” The fall in treasury yields is a strong indication that recession fears are being priced in.George Lagarias, chief economist at Forvis Mazars, added that bonds are acting as a safe haven amid the volatility of the global equity market.However, concerns remain about the sustainability of the bond rally. Lagarias cautioned that if the situation stabilizes, the demand for bonds could subside, especially with inflation still posing a risk. Moreover, he warned that central banks’ actions could influence bond market dynamics , urging investors to remain vigilant.","Germany's 10-year bund --the benchmark for the euro area -- saw a decrease from 2.72% on Wednesday to 2.59% by Monday afternoon.

Billionaires and business leaders Jamie Dimon and Bill Ackman cautioned against Donald Trump's tariffs and its impact on the global economy as the trade war escalated affecting the stock markets across globe.Global markets reeled from the impact of tariff, and the turbulence extended to Wall Street as US markets opened to a sharp downturn on Monday. The announcement of reciprocal tariffs triggered a broad sell-off across major financial markets in Asia and Europe, fueling fears among investors.Ackman, a Trump supported, urged the US president to ""call a 90-day time out, negotiate and resolve unfair asymmetric tariff deals, and induce trillions of dollars of new investment in our country.""JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned about the economic hardships that could result from Trump-era tariffs, while also acknowledging that there are “of course” valid reasons behind the move.Trump, however, dismissed the concerns and said that the ""big business"" were not worried about the tariff impact.""Big business is not worried about the Tariffs, because they know they are here to stay, but they are focused on the BIG, BEAUTIFUL DEAL, which will SUPERCHARGE our Economy. Very important. Going on right now!!!"" he said.Calling out on Trump's advisers to ""acknowledge their error"", Ackman said, ""The formula used by the administration to calculate tariffs made other nations’ tariffs appear four times larger than they actually are.""""The President’s advisors need to acknoledge their error before April 9th and make a course correction before the President makes a big mistake based on bad math,"" he said.In another post, he said that the tariff move was a ""self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down"".""When markets crash, new investment stops, consumers stop spending money, and businesses have no choice but to curtail investment and fire workers,"" he said.""And it is not just the big companies that will suffer. Small and medium size businesses and entrepreneurs will experience much greater pain. Almost no business can pass through an overnight massive increase in costs to their customers. And that’s true even if they have no debt, and, unfortunately, there is a massive amount of leverage in the system,"" he added.In a 60-page annual letter addressed to his shareholders, Jamie Dimon said, “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.”“We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products,” he added.Dimon pointed to the unpredictability of possible retaliatory measures, fluctuating investor confidence, impacts on corporate earnings, and volatility in the US dollar. “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better,” he said.He, however, did not mention Trump directly in the letter.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned about the economic hardships that could result from Trump-era tariffs.

$9.5 trillion and counting: How Donald Trump's 'Chart of Death' has upended world markets- 10 big numbers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/9-5-trillion-and-counting-how-donald-trumps-chart-of-death-has-upended-world-markets-10-big-numbers/articleshow/120068358.cms,"Trump slapped steep tariffs on US trading partners last week, triggering swift retaliation from China and raising fears that the escalating trade war could slow economic growth and push inflation higher.

Over in midtown Manhattan, Jay Hatfield, the CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors, was feeling much the same, just with a large dose of anger mixed in. “This is unambiguously stupid.” He calls the big tariff chart that Trump brandished at the ceremony last Wednesday “the chart of death,” and when he saw it, told himself to check his anger and just focus on unloading risky assets. By the end of Friday, he had cut about 40% of them from the mutual funds he manages. An article in Bloomberg titled Trump's Tariff 'Chart of Death' Has Wall Street Facing Harsh Reality

$2 trillion: Collapse of the “Magnificent Seven”: The group of dominant tech stocks – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla – collectively lost around $2 trillion in market value on Monday alone. These companies, once seen as untouchable growth engines, are now leading the downturn. Tesla dropped 7%, Apple 6.3%, and Nvidia over 7%. The sudden collapse reflects fears that Trump 's tariffs will squeeze profit margins and disrupt global supply chains, especially for firms heavily reliant on China for production or revenue. 2,227 points: Sensex 's steepest fall in 10 months: India's benchmark BSE Sensex crashed by 2,226.79 points, a nearly 3% drop, marking its most severe daily fall since June 2024. At one point during the session, it was down over 5%. Nearly every major stock on the index closed in the red, with metals and IT firms hit hardest due to fears of slowing global trade. Investors saw ₹14 lakh crore ($170 billion) in market cap wiped out, with FIIs dumping ₹3,483 crore worth of Indian equities. 13.2%: Hang Seng suffers worst day since 1997: Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index plummeted 13.2%, the sharpest single-day loss since the Asian Financial Crisis. China's retaliatory tariffs and escalating geopolitical tension spooked investors. With major U.S. firms caught in the crossfire and fears of further decoupling between US and Chinese markets, foreign investment flows are pulling back rapidly. 4.52%: S&P 500 dive signals bear market: The S&P 500 fell 4.52% on Monday, pushing it down over 20% from its February peak and confirming a bear market. It has now lost more than $5 trillion in value in just two trading days. Wall Street’s worst fears – a global recession triggered by tariffs, rising inflation, and a Federal Reserve constrained in its response – are materializing in real time. $60: US crude drops below critical threshold: For the first time since 2021, benchmark US crude oil fell below $60 a barrel. Markets are betting on collapsing demand as trade slows and economic output contracts. With global shipping, auto, and airline industries expected to cut consumption, oil is pricing in a global recession. Energy stocks, from Exxon to Reliance, took a hit across the board. $78,000: Bitcoin breaks below key level: Bitcoin tumbled below $78,000, falling sharply from its January peak above $100,000. Crypto, often viewed as an alternative asset during uncertainty, was not immune this time. The selloff was compounded by margin calls and liquidations across crypto-linked equities. Coinbase, Marathon Digital, and MicroStrategy all saw double-digit losses as faith in risk assets crumbled. 4,200 points: S&P 500 bear case forecast: RBC Capital Markets revised its downside scenario for the S&P 500 to 4,200 – a 17% fall from Friday’s close. The forecast assumes that “full recession pricing” takes hold, reflecting collapsing consumer demand, lower corporate earnings, and aggressive central bank action. Strategists believe that even with the market already deeply oversold, more pain may be ahead if Trump escalates his tariff policies. 45%: Odds of a US Recession, per Goldman Sachs: Goldman Sachs now places the likelihood of a US recession at 45% within the next 12 months. The bank cited increased policy uncertainty, a slump in capital investment, and weakening consumer confidence as key reasons. While some firms had hoped the tariffs were a negotiating ploy, Trump’s weekend comments suggest a long-term shift in economic policy – with real-world consequences. 7.8%: Nikkei's brutal fall: Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped nearly 8%, one of its worst performances in recent years. Japanese companies with major exposure to US and Chinese markets – from automakers like Toyota to electronics giants like Sony – saw billions in market cap erased. Prime Minister Ishiba, a close US ally, expressed “strong concern” that tariffs would disrupt Japanese investment in America. 5 rate cuts: What markets expect from the Fed: Investors are now pricing in the equivalent of five quarter-point rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2025, with a 60% chance of an emergency rate cut by next week. The dramatic shift reflects panic across financial markets. With inflation still elevated, the Fed faces a dilemma: cut rates to soften the blow or hold steady to avoid stoking price pressures. Either way, markets see the central bank losing control.

On his social media platform Truth Social, the president wrote: “Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid!... Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!”

Global financial markets spiraled into chaos on Monday as a three-day selloff intensified, wiping out approximately $9.5 trillion in equity value and plunging major indices into bear market territory, a Bloomberg report said. The trigger: US President Donald Trump 's aggressive new round of tariffs and an equally defiant stance on the fallout. With recession fears escalating, investors rushed for safety, driving up Treasuries and the yen, while equities, commodities, and crypto all tumbled sharply.European stocks sank to 16-month lows, and Asia marked its worst session since the 2008 financial crisis. The Nasdaq entered a bear market last week and the Dow is close behind. “It starts to feel as if the market is getting into a ‘sell now, ask questions later’ kind of mood,” Stephan Kemper, investment strategist at BNP Paribas Wealth, told Bloomberg.Here are ten of the most staggering numbers from around the globe:As markets reeled, Trump doubled down. “Forget markets for a second,” he told reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One. Dismissing criticism from allies and Wall Street titans alike, he added, “Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” When pressed about the potential economic damage, Trump was blunt: “They want to talk but there’s no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis.”But the markets aren’t buying it. Tesla tumbled another 7% as analyst Dan Ives warned of a “tariff economic armageddon.” Apple fell 6.3%, approaching one-year lows, with fears it may be forced to raise iPhone prices. “The concept of making iPhones in the US is a non-starter in our view at $1,000,” Ives wrote.With markets now pricing in a prolonged standoff and no diplomatic exit in sight, even Trump allies are beginning to voice concern. Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman called for a tariff pause, warning of an “economic nuclear winter.”As the US President digs in and global leaders scramble to respond, the only certainty left for investors is volatility. The medicine, it seems, is proving too bitter to swallow.(With inputs from agencies)","The S&P 500 fell 4.52% on Monday, pushing it down over 20% from its February peak and confirming a bear market.

Bitcoin faces ""Death Cross"" amid recession fears

Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are witnessing a downturn on Monday as global risk sentiment soured following new US tariff announcements. The market plummeted after US President Donald Trump made it clear that he would not back down from imposing sweeping import duties, signalling a potential recession and fuelling speculation of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve as soon as May.In a press conference, Trump told reporters that investors would need to ""take their medicine"" and that he would not negotiate with China until the US trade deficit was addressed. Beijing responded, saying the markets had already spoken on their retaliation plans.The new tariff regime introduced by the US includes a baseline 10% levy on imports, with significantly higher duties on major Asian trade partners—34% on China, 24% on Japan, 46% on Vietnam, and 25% on South Korea. The European Union is facing a 20% tariff. According to Fitch Ratings, the effective US import tax rate has skyrocketed to 22% under Trump, compared to just 2.5% in 2024, marking its highest level since 1910.As fears of a global economic slowdown grew, commodities and safe-haven assets also experienced sharp declines.According to an ET report, Brent crude fell by 6.5%, WTI dropped 7.4%, gold slid 2.4%, and silver plunged 7.3% on concerns over weakening global demand. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond fell by 8 basis points to 3.916% as investors sought out safer assets. Fed funds futures surged, indicating a potential 25-basis-point rate cut by the end of the year.As of 1:14 PM IST, Bitcoin was trading at $74,993, down 9.72% in the past 24 hours, after touching a low of $74,436. Ethereum also saw a sharp plunge, falling 18.4% to $1,467. The global cryptocurrency market cap dropped 8.59% to $2.44 trillion.""Bitcoin has broken below $75,000, signalling concerns that the US economy may be heading into a recession,"" said Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus. “Global markets are experiencing a broad sell-off, and this sentiment has spilled over into crypto markets,” added Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO of Mudrex. He also noted that the upcoming US crypto holdings disclosure could spark a potential relief rally.Altcoins saw even sharper declines, with XRP down 19%, Solana falling 18%, Dogecoin dropping 20%, and Cardano down 18%. Other altcoins such as BNB, Toncoin, Chainlink, Avalanche, and Shiba Inu saw losses between 11-17%.Bitcoin's market capitalization dropped to $1.49 trillion, with its dominance rising to 62.65%. Trading volume surged by 336.5% to $58.54 billion, with stablecoin transactions accounting for 94.16% of the total crypto trading volume, reaching $115.28 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.""Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin is nearing a 'death cross,' where the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, which could signal further bearish momentum,"" Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO of Unocoin told ET Prime.

‘We didn’t vote for this’: Trump's billionaire ally Bill Ackman turns on him amid tariff war chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/we-didnt-vote-for-this-trumps-billionaire-ally-bill-ackman-turns-on-him-amid-tariff-war-chaos/articleshow/120051785.cms,"Bill Ackman (File photo)

Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman , who publicly backed Donald Trump ’s presidential bid, has voiced strong concerns about the administration’s escalating trade war , urging the president to pull back before the economy takes a major hit.“The president has an opportunity to call a 90-day time out,” Ackman posted on X, proposing a temporary halt in the tariff fight to allow time for diplomatic negotiations.The influential investor cautioned that if Trump doesn’t change course, the consequences could be catastrophic. “If, on the other hand ... we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate.”With global markets already rattled, investors are bracing for further turmoil. Stock futures were down sharply Sunday night, continuing the two-day plunge triggered by Trump’s tariff declarations.Ackman emphasized that business confidence—a key driver of the economy—is fading fast. “Business is a confidence game. The president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe,” he said, warning that the fallout could hit those who supported Trump the hardest.“The consequences for our country and the millions of our citizens who have supported the president — in particular low-income consumers who are already under a huge amount of economic stress — are going to be severely negative.”He pointed out that most companies—regardless of size — are ill-prepared to absorb sudden cost hikes resulting from tariffs . “Almost no business can pass through an overnight massive increase in costs to their customers. And that’s true even if they have no debt, and, unfortunately, there is a massive amount of leverage in the system,” he added.Small and mid-sized firms, along with large corporations, could face enormous pressure if costs surge and consumer demand falters. Ackman also expressed skepticism toward administration officials who tried to downplay the potential for price increases, suggesting they were not facing economic reality.“This is not what we voted for,” Ackman stated. “The President has an opportunity on Monday to call a time out and have the time to execute on fixing an unfair tariff system. Alternatively, we are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down. May cooler heads prevail.”","Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has voiced strong concerns about the administration’s escalating trade war.

NEW DELHI: A global market rout intensified Monday following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs and Beijing’s retaliation with 34% duties on all US imports starting April 10.Stock markets across Asia plunged sharply, with investor sentiment collapsing as fears of a global trade war took hold. Analysts say over $9 trillion in market value has been wiped out in just two days, drawing comparisons with the 2008 financial crisis.Wall Street is bracing for further losses after Friday's sharp downturn. The S&P 500 fell 6%, the Dow Jones dropped 5.5%, and Nasdaq tumbled 5.8%, marking their worst single-day performance since the pandemic began. Meanwhile, US crude prices fell below $60 per barrel and the dollar weakened to 145.98 yen, showing a shift to traditional safe havens.Meanwhile, Top Trump officials said that over 50 countries have reached out to the White House for tariff talks after sweeping import taxes rattled global markets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that resolving unfair trade practices won’t happen quickly.Indian equity benchmark indices — BSE Sensex and Nifty50 — nosedived on Monday, plunging over 3.5% as mounting global trade tensions and external headwinds sent shockwaves through investor sentiment.Both indices suffered sharp intraday losses of nearly 5% before staging a partial recovery. The Sensex closed 2,227 points or 2.95% lower at 73,137.90, while the Nifty50 settled at 22,161.60, down 743 points or 3.24%.Tata Steel (-7.78%), L&T (-5.88%), Tata Motors (-5.56%), Kotak Mahindra Bank (-4.42%), and M&M (-4.06%) were among the biggest laggards on the Sensex. All 13 sectoral indices ended in the red, with technology stocks — heavily exposed to the US market — dropping 7%. The broader market saw a steep fall, with small- and mid-cap stocks down 6.2% and 4.6%, respectively.The latest market rout is being attributed to escalating fears of a global trade war, compounded by fresh US tariff measures and weak global cues.Amid the volatility, a senior finance ministry official told Reuters that India remains on track to meet its FY26 GDP growth target of 6.3–6.8%, assuming crude oil prices remain below $70 a barrel.Seoul’s Kospi dropped 5.5%, driven by losses in tech and manufacturing stocks. South Korea, heavily reliant on exports to the US and China, faces a dual-front challenge.Taiwan’s decision to restrict short selling spurred brief hope for stabilisation, but regional sell-offs continued.Kevin Hassett, head of the US National Economic Council, claimed, “More than 50 countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation.”The Tokyo market plunged 7.1%, with brief intra-day losses nearing 8%. Investors rushed to safe-haven assets, pushing the yen to 145.98 per dollar.US crude dipped below $60 per barrel for the first time since April 2021, highlighting global demand concerns.Donald Trump, unphased by the chaos, said, “Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”Beijing retaliated with a 34% tariff on all US imports starting April 10, sending the Shanghai Composite down 6.5%.The Chinese Commerce Ministry described the move as a direct counter to US “aggression,” escalating fears of a prolonged trade standoff.Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned, “The trade war could lead to higher inflation and lower growth.”Following Friday’s historic crash—S&P 500 (-6%), Dow (-5.5%), Nasdaq (-5.8%)—US futures pointed to more losses.Trump doubled down: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH.” Yet Jerome Powell responded firmly, “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.”GE Healthcare and DuPont saw double-digit losses amid fears of a regulatory clampdown from Beijing.Taipei’s Taiex fell 9.8% as trading resumed after a holiday. Regulators introduced temporary curbs on short selling until Friday to prevent a deeper rout.President Lai Ching-te said Taiwan would not impose retaliatory tariffs but aimed to negotiate a zero-tariff deal with Washington. A $2.7 billion stimulus was announced to cushion domestic impact.Australia's ASX 200 sank 6.3%, marking its lowest point in nearly 15 months. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, “You can’t change global events. What you can do is prepare for them.”The US imposed a 10% tariff on Australian goods, intensifying fears of recession.Singapore’s Straits Times Index crashed 8.5%, reflecting one of the steepest regional drops.The city-state’s heavy reliance on global trade has made it especially vulnerable to the spiralling tariff war.South Korea's benchmark KOSPI index dived 5.26 percent, or 129.57 points, to 2,335.85, triggering a so-called sidecar mechanism that briefly halted some trading for the first time in eight months.""South Korea has a very high trade dependency; it's a country that lives off trade, so when the US imposes excessively high tariffs like this, we become one of the hardest-hit economies,"" Kim Dae-jong at Sejong University in Seoul told AFP.UK markets were closed at the time of writing but are expected to open sharply lower. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in an op-ed, wrote, “The world as we knew it has gone,” urging a new focus on “deals and alliances.”Saudi markets plunged 6.78% on Sunday—its worst day since the pandemic. Aramco shares lost 6.2%, slashing over $133 billion in market value. Gulf peers Kuwait (-5.7%), Qatar (-4.2%), and Oman (-2.6%) also posted losses.“Trump’s tariffs weighed heavily on global markets, and specifically today on Saudi markets,” reported state-run Al-Ekhbariya.With global economic uncertainty mounting, central banks face pressure to act. But Powell signalled a cautious stance: “A one-time increase in the price level must not become an ongoing inflation problem.”The Fed now faces a trade-off—cut rates to cushion economic pain, or stay firm to prevent runaway inflation.As panic ripples across global markets, investor sentiment hinges on whether diplomacy can replace confrontation. As Trump put it, “They’re dying to make a deal.”","Indian equity benchmark indices — BSE Sensex and Nifty50 — nosedived on Monday, plunging over 3.5% as mounting global trade tensions and external headwinds sent shockwaves through investor sentiment.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

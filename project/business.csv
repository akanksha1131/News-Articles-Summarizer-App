Gensol Engineering under ED scanner over alleged links to Mahadev betting app scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gensol-engineering-under-ed-scanner-over-alleged-links-to-mahadev-betting-app-scandal/articleshow/120502125.cms,"Gensol Engineering promoters Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi

Background: Mahadev Book app syndicate

Sebi scrutiny of Gensol Engineering

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is preparing to question Gensol Engineering promoters, Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi, in connection with the ongoing investigation into the Mahadev Book app illegal betting and money laundering case, according to sources cited by the Economic Times.While formal summons have not yet been issued, the ED has frozen over 500,000 shares of Gensol Engineering. These shares were previously held by Dubai-based Zenith Multi Trading DMCC, an entity linked to accused Hari Shankar Tibrewal, an accused in the Mahadev betting app case. Investigators suspect that the shares were part of a scheme involving artificial stock price manipulation using tainted funds routed through foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).A senior government official stated, ""The probe has revealed stock manipulation using tainted funds in the Mahadev app case, which were received in Gensol Engineering through the FPI routes. The probe will ascertain whether the promoters were aware of this fact.""The ED recently attached assets worth Rs 573 crore related to the illegal betting network, including securities and demat holdings linked to Gensol. BSE data shows that as of December 2024, the ED’s Raipur Zonal Office holds 1.37 percent of Gensol’s equity.On April 16, the ED conducted coordinated searches across multiple cities, including the residence of EaseMyTrip founder Nishant Pitti in New Delhi. The agency is focused on uncovering how illicit funds were funneled into the market via preferential share allotments and promoter-controlled stock sales to manipulate Gensol’s share price.The Mahadev probe has expanded significantly, with the ED conducting searches at 170 premises and seizing assets worth over Rs 3,002 crore. Thirteen individuals have been arrested, and 74 entities have been named across five prosecution complaints. The investigation includes tracking money flows into offshore properties and cryptocurrency investments.The Mahadev Book app is allegedly at the center of a massive illegal betting and money laundering network. The syndicate is believed to have laundered over Rs 5,500 crore, investing the proceeds in cryptocurrencies, shell companies, and overseas real estate. The key accused, Saurabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal, are reported to have fled India and acquired Vanuatu citizenship.The ED’s May 2024 supplementary chargesheet outlines how funds were laundered using foreign entities and stock investments, identifying Tibrewal’s Dubai connection and Suraj Chokhani’s involvement in suspicious share deals.The ED scrutiny comes as Gensol Engineering is also under investigation by Sebi for alleged financial misconduct, misleading public disclosures, and fund diversion.Sebi’s interim order earlier this month alleged out that there was no real manufacturing activity at Gensol’s EV facility in Pune, despite the company’s claims of having secured 30,000 pre-orders. A site visit by NSE found only two to three workers on-site and minimal electricity usage, suggesting the plant was largely inactive.The EV pre-orders were reportedly found to be non-binding memorandums of understanding, lacking pricing details or delivery timelines. Additional concerns included a questionable deal with Refex Green Mobility that was later withdrawn and the inflated valuation of a US subsidiary sale. Out of Rs 977.75 crore in loans raised, over Rs 260 crore is reportedly unaccounted for, with funds allegedly misused for luxury expenses and transferred to entities linked to the promoters.As a result, Sebi barred the Jaggi brothers from holding market or executive positions. Their exit has also triggered a major operational halt at affiliate BluSmart, which suspended its electric cab services following the revelations.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is preparing to question Gensol Engineering promoters, Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi, in connection with the ongoing investigation into the Mahadev Book app illegal betting and money laundering case.

""Escalation of trade and tariff tensions and the resultant financial market volatility have raised concerns regarding the weakening of global growth in the near term,"" said an article on the state of the economy in the April issue of the RBI bulletin.""Although the dampening global economic outlook could impact India's economic growth through weaker external demand, the domestic growth engines are relatively less susceptible to external headwinds,"" said the report.It said that prospects for the farm sector were boosted by the forecast of an above-normal monsoon for 2025, which could augment farm incomes and keep food prices in check.""India is poised to benefit from supply chain realignments, diversified FDI sources, and engagement with global investors seeking resilience and scale, given its already established trade linkages ,"" said the report. It said that India's consistent strength in services exports and remittance inflows continue to provide a vital buffer for the current account.""Calibrated policy support can help India turn global volatility into an opportunity and strengthen its position in the emerging world economic landscape,"" said the report. It said that in the near term, the global growth outlook remains downcast, as uncertainty surrounding tariffs and the individual policy responses of different countries could result in lower investment spending, subdued consumer confidence, and a slowdown in global trade.It added that a decline in global commodity prices could ease price pressures in commodity importing countries, although currency pressures could partly offset such benefits.","India's economy has the strength to withstand headwinds triggered by the global tariff war due to a strong macroeconomic framework, an RBI report said.

India’s constructive engagement so far has been welcomed and I look forward to creating new opportunities for workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs in both countries,” USTR said in a statement.The statement followed US VP J D Vance’s meeting with PM Modi on Monday, where the two leaders appreciated the progress made in the proposed trade deal. “The US and India are hard at work on a trade agreement built on shared priorities, and I’m excited to announce that we officially finalised the Terms of Reference for our trade negotiations .

We don't know what provoked them,"" Sharma, who belongs to Hisar, said.After about a kilometre of being chased by the SUV, the bikers pulled to the road's side under the Dwarka Expressway, some 300 metres from the toll plaza.""We stopped to avoid confrontation. What we thought would be a calm ride turned into chaos. The men stopped their SUV and started hurling abuses at us. They tried to pull off our helmets to hit us. Maybe one of us overtook the car earlier and that triggered them,"" Sharma said.The 27-year-old said one of the bikers had a GoPro mounted on the two-wheeler and the camera recorded the assault.The video, seen by TOI, shows two men — one in yellow-coloured shorts and grey T-shirt, and another in a sleeveless red vest and track pants — assaulting two to three bikers while abusing them. Subsequently, one of the assailants asks which rider had made an obscene gesture, to which the biker responds that he does not know and repeatedly apologises.A third man, apparently one of the SUV occupants, is seen taking photos of bike number plates.""We tried to de-escalate the situation, but they started throwing punches. Most of the bikers ran from the spot. I fled too but returned when I saw one of our friends was stuck with them. Then they caught me and the other biker escaped. I even apologised for something I didn't do, but they began swinging a baseball bat at me,"" Sharma said, adding that: ""Fortunately, it hit my helmet and not my head.""Sharma suffered injuries to his thigh, hands and wrist.He said the four men brandished knives and threatened to kill them.Afterwards, they turned their rage to Sharma's sports bike and smashed it with the baseball bat.The men in the SUV fled soon after, Sharma said.The group of bikers drove till the toll plaza and alerted cops.""But the police didn't help. We waited at the toll for nearly half an hour. It took more than six hours just to determine which police station had jurisdiction to file the case,"" Sharma alleged.Eventually, a complaint was registered at the Sector 37 police station and an FIR was registered under BNS sections 351(3) (criminal intimidation), 324(3) (use of deadly weapon), 3(5) (common intention), 281 (rash driving), 126 (wrongful restraint) and 115 (endangering life).Sharma said the group has submitted GoPro footage from their bikes and tracked the accused's social media profiles using an online app called FaceCheck ID.Police denied that there was a delay and said Sharma was immediately taken to a hospital for medical examination and treatment.""An investigation is underway and crucial details and leads have been gathered.

What if Trump tries anyway?

US President Donald Trump fired a fresh salvo against Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, escalating attacks for resisting further interest rate cuts. The clash is rattling financial markets, raising a critical question: Can Trump actually fire Powell?The answer is murky—and the implications could be huge.Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, members of the Fed's Board of Governors are appointed to 14-year terms and can only be removed ""for cause,"" widely interpreted to mean serious misconduct—not policy disagreements. However, the law is less clear when it comes to the Fed chair’s four-year leadership term, which lacks explicit removal restrictions.According to Reuters, no US president has ever tried to oust a Fed chair, making any such move legally uncharted territory. Several unrelated legal cases involving Trump’s past efforts to remove leaders of independent agencies are now making their way through the courts—and could serve as precedent if Trump tries to push Powell out.In theory, Trump could attempt to remove Powell solely as chair while allowing him to remain a governor until his term ends in 2028. That would still leave Trump the opportunity to elevate another governor—potentially someone more aligned with his policy views—to the chair position.However, Fed independence is deeply valued, even among Trump’s own appointees, such as Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. That complicates any assumption that a leadership shakeup would lead directly to rate cuts.Trump has no direct control over the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the panel that sets interest rates. By custom, the FOMC picks the Fed chair as its own leader, but it could, in principle, choose another member, even if Powell remains on the board.Attempting to fire Powell entirely—as a governor—would be the boldest move. If successful, it would create a board and chair vacancy, giving Trump a chance to reshape Fed leadership in his own image. But such a step would almost certainly face a legal challenge.Powell, a former lawyer and investment banker, has repeatedly insisted that the law protects his position. If fired, he could mount a federal court case using his personal wealth to fund the effort.Reuters also reports that Trump has floated the idea of replacing Powell with former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, though Warsh reportedly advised against the move, urging Trump to allow Powell to finish his term, which ends in May 2026.White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett—also rumored as a potential successor—confirmed last week that the idea of removing Powell is under review within the administration.So—can Trump fire Powell? Legally uncertain. Politically explosive. Economically risky.But one thing is clear: the showdown over central bank independence may be just beginning.","US President Donald Trump fired a fresh salvo against Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.

As US-China trade tensions heat up, a new wave of patriotic investing is sweeping across China. Spurred by former President Donald Trump 's tariff threats, everyday citizens are entering the stock market—not for profit, but to show support for their country. From designers to teachers and traders, retail investors are pouring money into sectors tied to China’s national agenda, turning the market into a symbol of resilience and unity.Cao Mingjie, a home designer from China's Guangdong province, had never traded stocks before US President Donald Trump’s ""Liberation Day"" speech on April 2. The announcement of ""reciprocal tariffs"" that ramped up the trade war between the US and China pushed Cao to change his mind. He decided to invest 2,000 yuan ($274) each month in the local stock market—not for profit, but to show his solidarity with Beijing in the face of the escalating trade dispute.""The goal isn’t to make money. It’s about contributing to my country,"" Cao said, explaining his decision to open trading accounts and back the Chinese market after the tariffs hit Chinese stocks. ""In this trade war, every individual should stand by the country until the end.""According to Reuters, Cao is not alone. Retail investors across China are joining a growing movement to defend the stock market , which has become another front in the widening Sino-US conflict.They are pouring money into stocks, particularly those linked to sectors benefiting from China's national agenda, such as defense, consumer goods, and semiconductors. This surge of ""patriotic"" buying marks a shift for retail investors, typically known for their speculative trading, and is seen as a welcome development by Chinese authorities trying to stabilize the capital markets amid the trade war’s uncertainties.Since the sharp drop in Chinese stocks on April 4, retail investors have poured 45 billion yuan into the market, reversing the outflows seen earlier in the trade conflict, data from financial information provider Datayes shows. This reflects a broader trend of domestic confidence returning, supported by state-backed efforts to stabilize the market.The coordination between private and state investors—who were previously at odds during the 2015 market crash and the crackdown on technology companies—appears more unified now. As Trump threatens even more drastic tariffs, Chinese officials have taken proactive steps, with top brokerages pledging to steady prices and numerous companies unveiling share buybacks to bolster market confidence.Chinese Premier Li Qiang has urged government officials to take stronger actions to stabilize the stock market, and the efforts seem to be paying off. China’s stock market has rebounded by 8% since the low of April 7, while US stocks have fallen over 8% in the same period.“We think China’s A-share market is of greater strategic importance,” said Meng Lei, equity strategist at UBS Securities. “Patriotic bets have meaningfully improved investor sentiment.”Many individual investors, like Zhou Lifeng from Ningxia in China’s northwest, have vowed to continue investing regardless of the losses they may incur. ""Being patriotic means holding on to your stocks,"" Zhou, a mountain climber, said. He owns a large portfolio, including consumer and defense stocks, and plans to keep adding more.Others, like restaurant operator Shu Hao, have also pledged significant investments, motivated by domestic companies' efforts to support exporters affected by tariffs. Retail giants such as JD.com, Alibaba’s Freshippo, and supermarket chains like CR Vanguard have launched initiatives to help these companies shift their focus to local markets.Even professionals are shifting their strategies, with hedge fund manager Yang Tingwu pouring his remaining funds into Chinese stocks. ""This is war, only without gun smoke,"" Yang said, emphasizing the gravity of the trade conflict. “You’re placing bets not just on your portfolio, but on the fate of your country.”Some investors are making more personal commitments, like Nancy Lu, a teacher in Jiangsu province. Despite her portfolio ""bleeding,"" she remains resolute: “I won’t sell a single stock. I’ll help defend the market for our country. I have never felt so proud as a retail investor.”","Retail investors across China are joining a growing movement to defend the stock market, which has become another front in the widening Sino-US conflict.

China's trade war with US



Despite China's significant economic growth over the past 18 years, investors have not seen corresponding financial gains. Whilst China has established itself as the world's second-largest economy after the US, its primary stock market indicator, the Shanghai Composite Index, has shown stagnant returns.The Shanghai Composite, encompassing all Shanghai Stock Exchange listings, remains at levels comparable to early 2007. Similarly, the Hang Seng index, home to prominent Chinese corporations such as Tencent, Alibaba, and Meituan, has demonstrated negligible returns during this timeframe, according to an ET report.By comparison, the US S&P 500 has risen above 250 per cent whilst India's Nifty 50 has achieved nearly 500 per cent growth in the corresponding period.This underwhelming performance is particularly notable considering China's GDP has more than doubled between 2008 and 2024. Despite recognition for substantial infrastructure development, technological advancement, and export growth, the stock market has not reflected these economic achievements.Even after the global market recovery following the pandemic, Chinese markets continue to struggle post-Covid crash.The Hang Seng index currently trades at levels equivalent to those witnessed at the 2020 market bottom during the worldwide pandemic impact.China maintained 6-8 per cent annual economic growth until 2018, subsequently declining to 4.9 per cent in 2024. Initial growth stemmed from exports, industrial production, and foreign investment, whilst post-2018 focus shifted towards technology and consumption-driven expansion. The 2021 property sector decline and increasing debt necessitated interventions, including a 3 trillion yuan bond initiative.The disappointing returns might be attributed to state economy structural issues. Numerous listed Chinese companies are state-controlled entities, prioritising government objectives over shareholder interests. This approach potentially compromises profit focus and affects investor confidence.China's stock market has been heavily impacted by an escalating trade war with the US under President Trump. The conflict has intensified with reciprocal tariffs—Chinese exports to the US face duties up to 145 per cent, while China has imposed 125 per cent tariffs on American goods. This economic standoff between the world’s two largest economies has triggered global market volatility and fears of a broader economic slowdown.President Trump stated that talks with China were ongoing and expressed optimism about reaching a favorable deal, citing multiple communication attempts by Chinese officials. Speaking from the Oval Office, he reaffirmed his confidence in a resolution.However, China has neither confirmed active negotiations nor backed away from its firm stance, instead voicing willingness to endure the trade tension. Beijing has criticized the US for unilateral, protectionist policies and warned against returning to a global system where ""the strong prey on the weak,"" stressing the need for fair diplomacy.","Despite China's significant economic growth over the past 18 years, investors have not seen corresponding financial gains.

Swiss pharma giant Roche to invest $50 billion in US amid growing tariff uncertainty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/swiss-pharma-giant-roche-to-invest-50-billion-in-us-amid-growing-tariff-uncertainty/articleshow/120515033.cms,"Photo credit - AP

Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche announced Tuesday it will invest $50 billion in the United States over the next five years, amid escalating uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump 's trade policies The move follows a similar decision by rival Novartis, which recently committed to a $23 billion US investment, news agency AFP reported.The US market is critical to Roche, accounting for over half the revenue of its pharmaceutical division. The company’s latest investment will strengthen its US footprint with expansions in manufacturing, distribution, and research.Roche said the investment will create more than 12,000 new jobs, including around 6,500 in construction. Key sites in Kentucky, Indiana, New Jersey, Oregon, and California will be upgraded or expanded to support the company’s innovative medicines and diagnostics. A new R&D center focused on artificial intelligence will also be established in Massachusetts.“Today’s announced investments underscore our long-standing commitment to research, development, and manufacturing in the US,” said CEO Thomas Schinecker. “These $50 billion investments over five years will support the next era of innovation and benefit patients globally.”Roche currently employs over 25,000 people across 24 sites in eight US states.Once the new facilities are operational, the company expects to export more medicines from the US than it imports.The announcement comes as the US government launches national security investigations into pharmaceutical imports, alongside probes into semiconductors and chip-making equipment. While drugs initially enjoyed tariff exemptions, growing trade tensions have cast doubt over the future.""Whether these investments were planned before the new administration is beside the point,” said Stefan Schneider, an analyst at Swiss investment firm Vontobel. “They may help Swiss pharma avoid further tariffs, which could severely disrupt global drug supply chains and threaten patient care.”Despite the strategic announcement, Roche shares dipped 0.6% in late morning trading, in line with the broader Swiss market decline of 0.8%.","Roche announced Tuesday it will invest $50 billion in the United States over the next five years.

"US slaps up to 3,521% duties on Southeast Asian solar imports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-slaps-up-to-3521-duties-on-southeast-asian-solar-imports/articleshow/120505074.cms,"AI-generated image (Credit: Lexica)

Which country faces what?

The United States has announced imposition of substantial new duties reaching up to 3,521 per cent on solar imports from four Southeast Asian nations, supporting domestic manufacturers whilst creating challenges for the nation's renewable energy development.The duties, announced on Monday, follow a year-long trade investigation that claims that solar manufacturers in Cambodia Malaysia and Thailand were receiving unfair government subsidies and selling products to the US below production costs, as quoted by Bloomberg.The investigation, initiated under former President Joe Biden, was requested by domestic solar manufacturers. Despite Biden's Inflation Reduction Act spurring investment in domestic solar panel production, manufacturers expressed concern about foreign competitors selling equipment at reduced prices.These duties will advantage domestic manufacturers but create difficulties for US renewable developers who have depended on affordable foreign supplies, adding uncertainty to a sector already affected by Washington's policy fluctuations.These charges will supplement existing widespread tariffs implemented by US President Donald Trump that have disrupted global supply chains and markets.The department's decision favours domestic manufacturing, which both Trump and Biden have supported; offering an advantage to firms like Hanwha Q Cells and First Solar Inc.""This is a decisive victory for American manufacturing,"" stated Tim Brightbill, co-chair of Wiley's international trade practice and lead counsel for the petitioning solar companies. The investigation confirms ""what we've long known: that Chinese-headquartered solar companies have been cheating the system, undercutting US companies and costing American workers their livelihoods,"" he added.Cambodia faces countrywide duties of 3,521 per cent after ceasing participation in the investigation. Meanwhile, Vietnamese companies face duties up to 395.9 per cent, Thailand 375.2 per cent, and Malaysia 34.4 per cent.Specific companies received varying rates: Jinko Solar faces 245 per cent for Vietnamese exports and 40 per cent for Malaysian exports, whilst Trina Solar faces 375 per cent for Thai exports and over 200 per cent for Vietnamese exports. JA Solar modules from Vietnam could receive approximately 120 per cent.These four countries supplied $12.9 billion worth of solar equipment to the US last year, representing 77% of total module imports, according to BloombergNEF.The duties' implementation depends on the US International Trade Commission's upcoming decision regarding harm to domestic producers.Following similar duties on Chinese imports approximately 12 years ago, Chinese manufacturers relocated to unaffected nations. This investigation began after an April petition from the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, representing companies including First Solar, Hanwha Q Cells and Mission Solar Energy LLC.","The United States has announced substantial new duties reaching up to 3,521 per cent on solar imports from four Southeast Asian nations.

"Dollar hits 3-year low, Dow slips 2% as Fed’s independence escalates",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dollar-hits-3-year-low-dow-slips-2-as-feds-independence-escalates/articleshow/120491171.cms,"US President Donald Trump 's renewed attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the central bank's independence are stirring market uncertainty, contributing to the US dollar hitting a three-year low.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major foreign currencies, fell to 97.92 on Monday, marking its lowest level since March 2022, according to FactSet data. As of 10:00 a.m. ET, the index was down 1.1% on the day, trading at 98.24.Investors, grappling with trade tensions and Fed policy concerns, are increasingly turning to alternative safe-haven assets, like gold, which surged to a record high on Monday.As of 10:54 AM GMT-4 on April 21, U.S. stock markets experienced significant losses, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropping 834.74 points, or 2.13%, to 38,307.49. The Nasdaq Composite declined by 425.39 points, or 2.61%, to 15,861.05, and the S&P 500 fell 118.24 points, or 2.24%, to 5,164.46. In contrast, gold prices surged, rising by 102 points, or 3.06%, to reach 3,430.4,Trump lashed out at Powell on social media again on Monday, calling him a “major loser” and demanding that the Fed cut interest rates.The President’s attacks came after comments from Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council, who revealed last week that the Trump administration was “studying” the possibility of removing Powell.Hassett noted that “new legal analysis” would be necessary before deciding whether Trump could or should terminate the Fed chief, marking a shift from his earlier stance of supporting the Fed’s independence.While experts argue that Trump likely lacks the authority to dismiss Powell over policy differences, especially with the central bank’s long-standing independence, the President’s willingness to break norms and confront the Fed signals potential turbulence for US markets.Powell himself, who was appointed by Trump in 2018, acknowledged the significant economic risks posed by Trump’s trade tariffs. Speaking at an event in Chicago last week, Powell warned that the tariffs, unprecedented in their scale, could stoke inflation and dampen growth, complicating the Fed’s ability to cut rates to support the economy.Concerns over the Fed’s independence and Trump’s ongoing trade war are fuelling market jitters, with analysts warning that investors may begin losing confidence in the US financial system.Jonas Goltermann, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, noted that Trump’s criticism of Powell serves as a reminder that trade policy is not the only avenue through which unconventional presidential actions could undermine the dollar and US markets, as per CNN report.Indeed, the dollar has faced significant pressure this year, falling to 140.76 yen — its weakest level since September. Analysts are attributing this decline to growing investor unease over the Trump administration’s economic policies, including its ongoing trade war and tariffs. While the US dollar traditionally benefits in times of market volatility, the flight from the dollar, alongside a lack of progress on trade talks, is signalling broader concerns about the stability of the US economy.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note also rose on Monday, reaching 4.365% after a public holiday on Friday. With the Fed’s upcoming meeting in early May, traders are keenly watching whether the central bank will make any adjustments to interest rates amid the growing uncertainty. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 88% of traders expect the Fed to maintain current rates.As Trump’s trade war and tariffs continue to dominate headlines, European markets are becoming increasingly attractive to investors, who view the US dollar and US assets as more uncertain.Meanwhile, gold continues to see robust demand as a safe haven, with prices surging more than 2% on Monday to hit a fresh record high of over $3,400 per ounce. Gold has been on an impressive rally this year, up more than 27% so far, outpacing its performance throughout 2024.The earnings season is also in full swing this week, with investors looking closely at the first-quarter results from major tech firms. Tesla, which will release its earnings on Tuesday, and Alphabet, set to report on Thursday, are expected to offer insights into how companies are navigating the uncertain economic landscape shaped by tariffs and trade tensions.As the global economic environment remains volatile, analysts, including Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, expect that tariff concerns will remain a dominant theme in the coming months, even as investor attention shifts to corporate earnings.","US dollar falls to three-year low against a basket of major foreign currencies.

US stocks experienced a sharp decline on Monday as concerns about US President Donald Trump ’s trade war and his criticism of the Federal Reserve prompt investors to pull back from US markets.As of 4:10 p.m. ET, Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 953 points (-2.4%) to 38,170.41. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.6%, closing at 15,870.90, while the S&P 500 also saw a steep decline of 174.74 points (-2.4%), settling at 5,158.20.The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiked to 35.57, an increase of 19.97%, signaling increased investor anxiety. The surge in volatility came amid concerns over global economic risks and domestic political tensions. Despite the turmoil in the equity markets, gold continued its upward trajectory, rising 3.09% to $3,431.20 per ounce as investors sought safe-haven assets amid the broader market selloff.The US dollar showed resilience during the session, with the EUR/USD pair climbing 0.992% to 1.15, as the currency benefited from market uncertainty. Meanwhile, oil prices remained under pressure, dropping 2.55% to $63.03 per barrel, reflecting concerns over global demand. The 10-year US Treasury yield also saw an increase of 1.664%, reaching 4.399%, indicating rising demand for government bonds as a safer investment.More concerning, the value of the US dollar has also weakened as a retreat from US markets continues. This move is unusual, as the dollar has typically strengthened during times of market nervousness.However, this time, policies from Washington are fuelling fears and potentially eroding the dollar’s reputation as a global economic pillar and a safe investment.Trump continued his hardliner stance on global trade over the weekend, even as economists and investors warn that his proposed tariffs could lead to a recession if not reversed. US negotiations with Japan last week have failed to reach an agreement that could lower tariffs and protect the economy, with the talks being viewed as a ""test case,"" according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie.“The golden rule of negotiating and success: He who has the gold makes the rules,” Trump posted in all capital letters on his Truth Social Network over the weekend. He added that “the businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at business, but really bad at politics,” also in all caps.Trump has increasingly focused on China, the world’s second-largest economy, which has escalated its rhetoric against the US China warned on Monday that other countries should not make trade deals with the US “at the expense of China’s interests,” as Japan, South Korea, and others negotiate agreements.“If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement.Compounding market concerns are Trump’s ongoing criticisms of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Last week, Trump again targeted Powell for not cutting interest rates sooner to give the economy a boost. The Fed has been hesitant to lower rates too quickly to avoid reigniting inflation after it has nearly reached its 2% target, down from more than 9% three years ago.On Monday, Trump again called for action, suggesting a slowdown in the US economy unless “Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates.”If Trump were to move to fire Powell, it could send shockwaves through financial markets. While lower interest rates tend to benefit stocks and other investments, the larger concern would be that a less independent Fed could struggle to control inflation in the long run. This would further undermine, if not destroy, the US reputation as the safest place in the world to hold cash.Meanwhile, several Big Tech stocks contributed to the market decline ahead of their earnings reports later this week. Tesla, for example, dropped 6.7%. The electric vehicle maker's stock was already 50% below its record set in December due to criticism that its stock price had become too inflated and that its brand had become overly associated with Elon Musk, who is leading efforts to cut US government spending.On the positive side, Discover Financial Services and Capital One Financial saw gains after the US government approved their proposed merger. Discover surged 3%, while Capital One rose 0.9%.In the bond market, shorter-term Treasury yields fell as investors held onto hopes that the Fed may cut its key overnight interest rate later this year to support the economy. However, longer-term yields fluctuated as doubts about the US economy's standing in the global market mounted. The yield on the 10-year Treasury reached 4.40% in the morning, up from 4.34% at the end of last week and from about 4% earlier this month. It later retreated to 4.34%.The US dollar also weakened against the euro, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and other currencies.Abroad, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.3%, while stocks in Seoul rose by 0.2%, and Shanghai’s index gained 0.4%.","Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 953 points (-2.4%) to 38,170.41.

Report: China tells its airlines to halt deliveries of new Boeing aircrafts and parts

A second Boeing jet meant for a Chinese airline is on its way back to the US on Monday, according to flight tracking data, reported Reuters. A Boeing 737 MAX intended for Xiamen Airlines in China made an unexpected return to the US on Sunday, landing at Boeing Field in Seattle.The jet was one of several 737 MAX aircraft that had been waiting at Boeing’s Zhoushan completion centre in China for final work and delivery, reported The Guardian. However, the trade war between the US and China, triggered by us president Donald Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports, has now disrupted this plan.As of this month, Trump has increased tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting China to retaliate with its own 125% tariffs on US-made products, including aircraft. The imposition of these tariffs presents a significant problem for Chinese airlines, as the 737 MAX, Boeing’s bestselling model, has a market value of approximately $55 million. The tariffs could make it financially unfeasible for Chinese airlines to take delivery of these jets. Beijing is reportedly considering measures to support its airlines, particularly those leasing Boeing jets, to mitigate the increased costs.The confusion surrounding the changing tariffs has left many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline executives indicating they may delay aircraft deliveries rather than incur the extra costs. The situation is also having a broader impact on Boeing, which has a substantial order backlog, including around 130 jets for Chinese customers, according to reports. Analysts warn that the uncertainty over the tariffs could disrupt not only Boeing’s delivery schedules but also the entire aircraft manufacturing sector, which relies heavily on international sales.At a US Senate hearing earlier this month, Boeing’s CEO Kelly Ortberg had expressed concerns about the possibility of certain markets closing off to the company due to these tariff battles. While the details of which party decided to return the jet to the US remain unclear, it highlights the significant impact the ongoing trade war is having on the aviation industry.","A Boeing 737 MAX intended for Xiamen Airlines in China made an unexpected return to the US on Sunday, landing at Boeing Field in Seattle. The jet was one of several 737 MAX aircraft that had been waiting at Boeing’s Zhoushan completion centre in China for final work and delivery. As of this month, Trump has increased tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting China to retaliate with its own 125% tariffs on US-made products.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120476859,imgsize-20326,width-400,resizemode-4/120476859.jpg"

This has led to a surge in clearance requirements and delays in international shipments to the U.S.Shipments under the $800 threshold remain unaffected, regardless of whether they are destined for businesses or consumers. Business-to-business (B2B) shipments over the new threshold will also continue but may also experience processing delays.DHL emphasized that the suspension is not permanent and said it is working to manage the increased customs workload.The new customs rules are part of broader trade measures introduced by US President Donald Trump. These include tighter import regulations and tariff policies aimed at reducing trade imbalances, particularly with China. Notably, the changes revoke duty-free status for small parcels from China—a move seen as targeting budget e-commerce platforms such as Temu and Shein, which rely heavily on low-cost, direct-to-consumer international shipping.",DHL suspends package deliveries exceeding $800 in value from companies to individual recipients in the United States.

‘Magnificent seven’ loom around uncertainty and turmoil amid Trump's turbulence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/magnificent-seven-loom-around-uncertainty-and-turmoil-amid-trumps-turbulence/articleshow/120473610.cms,"Leading tech firms loom around economic disturbance and uncertainty as they set to report the first-quarter earnings this week. The return of Donald Trump to the White House is one of the key reasons behind the current state of these big firms. Reciprocal tariffs and unstable markets have impacted the performance of the global economy.The ‘magnificent seven’- which includes Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, and Alphabet (google parent), are the leading firms of the technology sector and firms have altogether seen a blow of 22 per cent, which is $3.8 trillion from its market value as of Sunday.“The mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,” said Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities.The current rollercoaster in the market stands in stark contrast to the expectations and optimism once showcased by the heads of these seven firms- Apple’s Tim Cook, Tesla’s Elon Musk, Google’s Sundar Pichai, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos — who appeared in rare harmony as they stood by US President Donald Trump at his January inauguration.The support of these heads was not only symbolic- rather it was rooted in a calculated move that Trump’s comeback would ease the trade regulations, earlier set up by former President Joe Biden.Rather than reaping the expected benefits, big tech now finds itself struggling to protect its footing.The Trump administration’s hardline trade agenda — especially the sweeping reciprocal tariffs unveiled on April 2 — has disturbed global supply chains and overturned corporate planning. While a temporary suspension of the harshest tariffs and exemptions for Chinese electronics imports have offered momentary relief, President Trump has signaled that this grace period may be short-lived.Alongside the trade tensions, Trump’s administration is still going after big tech with antitrust cases that started under former President Biden. Meta is being sued for allegedly running an illegal monopoly in social media, and Alphabet is fighting efforts to break up its control over online search. Apple and Amazon are also still under investigation and facing lawsuits.Trumps' call to ban Nvidia from selling a key AI chip to China has resulted in a $5.5 billion charge tied to its unsold inventory of processors earmarked for Chinese markets.With the onset of the earnings season, the heads of these big techs will be under pressure as they navigate their way through the current turmoil- both economic and political. With political challenges and shaken market confidence, this earnings season could be one of the most important for Big Tech in recent years.Tesla will report first on Tuesday, after revealing a 13 per cent drop in car sales amid protests over Elon Musk’s involvement in the administration's cost-cutting efforts. Google parent Alphabet will follow on Thursday, with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple reporting next week. Nvidia, operating on a different fiscal schedule, will finish earnings season with its report on May 28.","The'magnificent seven'- Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, and Alphabet- are the leading firms of the technology sector.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

(AI image)

Gold prices are likely to maintain a bullish momentum in the coming days. However, today’s technical set-up signals a sell on rise strategy, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

Here is his strategy for gold investors:

Gold Intraday Trading View: Sell on Rise Strategy

Rationale:

Entry Zone: SELL GOLD DEC NEAR 117250-117400

Stop-Loss (SL): 118200

Target (TGT): 116400

Conclusion:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price prediction today:The gold market is currently in a state of high volatility, with strong underlying bullish momentum offset by a potential for short-term correction. For intraday traders, a ""sell on rise"" strategy near key resistance levels is a high-risk, high-reward approach that can be considered.This analysis, based on a combination of intraday technical indicators, outlines the rationale behind a ""sell on rise"" setup for the MCX Gold December contract.The market is fundamentally bullish, but the technicals suggest it may be overextended in the very short term.The proposed sell-on-rise strategy is based on the premise that the confluence of overbought indicators (RSI and Bollinger Bands) and the price stalling at a key resistance level (117250-117400) will lead to a temporary correction. The current price action may be a result of profit-booking by short-term traders.This entry point is strategically chosen to be at a key resistance level where the price has previously faced selling pressure.The stop-loss is placed well above the recent high, providing a safety net in case the bullish momentum continues and breaks out of the overbought zone. This is a critical risk management component for a counter-trend trade.This target is a plausible short-term objective, aligning with the previous day's low or a key support level, where a correction might find a foothold.While the overall trend for gold remains strongly bullish, the intraday technical setup presents an opportunity for a short-term, high-risk ""sell on rise"" trade. This strategy is for nimble intraday traders who are comfortable with counter-trend setups and have a strict risk management plan. The trade relies on a temporary correction fueled by overbought conditions and profit-booking rather than a reversal of the primary trend.","Gold prices are likely to maintain a bullish momentum in the coming days.

Youngest billionaire vs youngest entrants

India’s richest and overall trends





Chennai-born Aravind Srinivas, 31, has emerged as India’s youngest billionaire, debuting on the M3M Hurun India Rich List 2025. As the founder and CEO of AI startup Perplexity, Srinivas is gaining recognition for his work in generative AI, having an estimated net worth of Rs 21,190 crore.Srinivas’ rise signals a shift in India’s wealth landscape, where young tech entrepreneurs are joining traditional industrialists among the country’s richest. While Mukesh Ambani reclaimed the top spot in 2025, Srinivas’ entry highlights the growing influence of technology-driven entrepreneurship in wealth creation, particularly in AI, fintech, and digital platforms.Born on June 7, 1994, in Chennai, Srinivas studied at IIT Madras and later earned a PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2021, focusing on contrastive learning and transformer-based models.He worked at OpenAI, DeepMind, and Google, contributing to projects including DALL-E 2, HaloNet, and ResNet-RS. In August 2022, he co-founded Perplexity AI, an AI-powered chat search engine leveraging GPT-3 models, and has invested in startups like ElevenLabs and Suno.Srinivas, 31, made his debut as a billionaire, becoming the youngest billionaire on the Hurun list. Meanwhile, Zepto co-founders Kaivalya Vohra (22) and Aadit Palicha (23) also appeared on the list, making them the youngest entrants overall, though their net worths are below the billionaire threshold.Despite a 6 per cent dip in his wealth, Mukesh Ambani returned as India’s richest individual with Rs 9.55 lakh crore, ahead of Gautam Adani (Rs 8.14 lakh crore).Roshni Nadar Malhotra of HCL entered the top three for the first time with Rs 2.84 lakh crore, becoming the richest woman in India. The Hurun list now counts over 350 billionaires and 1,687 individuals with wealth above Rs 1,000 crore, including 148 newcomers, with India adding nearly one new billionaire per week over the past two years.","Chennai-born Aravind Srinivas, 31, has emerged as India’s youngest billionaire, debuting on the M3M Hurun India Rich List 2025.

As Diwali 2025 approaches, gold and silver markets have shown remarkable performance, with increases of over 47% and 52% respectively this year. On the MCX, prices have exceeded Rs 1,18,000 per 10 grams, leading investors to speculate about further growth potential during the upcoming festive period.Analysts, quoted by Economic Times, predict continued growth, with gold potentially reaching Rs 1.22 lakh by Diwali.The 2025 precious metals surge has been driven by various factors including festival demand, accommodative central bank policies, global political tensions and sustained ETF investments, leading to unprecedented price levels.Silver prices have also risen significantly, trading above Rs 1.44 lakh per kg, with projections suggesting Rs 1.50 lakh by the festival period.Renisha Chainani of Augmont Research anticipates a ""bullish-to-consolidation phase"" during Diwali, noting that whilst recent gains might encourage profit-taking, the overall positive trend continues. ""Gold has surged past Rs 1,18,000 on MCX while silver trades above Rs 1,44,000, supported by safe-haven demand amid the US government shutdown, tariff uncertainty, and expectations of further Fed rate cuts,"" Chainani told ETMarkets.Regarding Diwali 2025 projections for precious metals- Chainani forecasts that by October 21, gold could reach $3950-$4000 internationally (Rs 1,20,000-Rs 1,22,000 on MCX), while silver might achieve $49-$50 (Rs 1,48,000-Rs 1,50,000), particularly if global tensions increase. She notes that ""key drivers of bullishness include dovish Fed policy, a weaker US dollar, continued ETF inflows, and robust Indian festive demand. ""The industrial sector and green energy requirements could boost silver demand. However, she notes that market stabilisation could occur due to profit collection, US dollar strengthening, or reduced global tensions.Manoj Kumar Jain from Prithvifinmart Commodity Research notes that September's performance, with gold increasing over 10% and silver 15% internationally, indicates a ""super bull run"" for both metals. Additionally, his predictions include gold reaching Rs 1,22,000 by Diwali and Rs 1,25,000 by year-end, with silver potentially hitting Rs 1,50,000 and Rs 1,58,000-Rs 1,60,000 respectively.Internationally, Jain anticipates gold at $3940-$4000 and silver at $48.40-$50 per troy ounce. Support levels are $3720 (international) and Rs 1,10,660 (domestic) for gold, with silver at $44.40 and Rs 1,34,400. Jain recommends: ""We suggest buying gold and silver on dips for the target of Rs 1,22,000 and Rs 1,50,000, respectively and avoid any kind of short selling in both precious metals.""As Diwali approaches, jeweller and retail demand is expected to increase. Traditional peak buying during festivals and weddings could further strengthen prices already elevated by global economic uncertainties.Despite potential profit-taking opportunities, analysts maintain that fundamental factors remain positive, with any price decreases likely being temporary.Jigar Trivedi of Reliance Securities said, ""By Diwali 2025, gold may trade around Rs 1,19,000-Rs1,20,000/10g, driven by global uncertainties, central bank buying, high inflation, Fed stance and a weaker rupee. Safe-haven demand is strong as geopolitical tensions and economic slowdown fears persist.""He adds that silver might reach Rs 1,48,000-Rs 1,50,000/kg, supported by industrial applications, particularly in solar energy and EVs, alongside investment interest. ""Supply constraints and a falling rupee further fuel price momentum. With interest rates expected to fall globally, precious metals may gain. However, high volatility and profit-booking can cause short dips. Overall, both metals show a bullish outlook for Diwali 2025 in rupee terms, supported by macroeconomic trends, weak INR, and robust investor interest in hard assets,"" Trivedi further added.","Gold and silver markets have shown remarkable performance, with increases of over 47% and 52% respectively this year.

The leases, located in the Powder River Basin—the country’s most productive coal region—were expedited following a January executive order by President Donald Trump.While the auctions align with Trump’s goal of increasing coal extraction from federal lands for power generation, an Associated Press analysis shows that many power stations served by these mines plan to stop using coal within a decade.The forthcoming sales will go ahead despite the government shutdown, as workers handling fossil fuel permits and leases are exempt from furlough. Then-President Biden had attempted to block future coal leases in the region last year, citing climate change concerns. According to the Department of Energy, burning coal from these leases could generate over 1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide.Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced that more than 20,000 square miles of federal lands would be opened for mining—an area larger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.The administration has also reduced federal coal royalty rates, extended a Michigan coal plant’s operation, and allocated $625 million for plant modernisation, citing rising electricity demand from AI and data centres. ""We're putting American miners back to work,"" Burgum said. ""We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.""The key question remains: who will actually purchase this coal? Data from the US Energy Information Administration and Global Energy Monitor indicate declining demand for the mines slated for expansion or new leases, as power stations reduce coal consumption or plan to cease operations entirely.Montana and Wyoming sales were requested by Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC), which acquired several Powder River Basin mines in a 2019 bankruptcy auction. These mines supply 34 power stations across 19 states, but 21 of these stations plan to stop using coal within a decade, including all five served by NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.In government filings, NTEC valued 167 million tonnes of federal coal near Spring Creek at around $126,000—less than one-tenth of a penny per tonne, far below historical prices. NTEC justified the low valuation, citing forecasts of declining coal demand:""The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints.""The government will auction 440 million tonnes near NTEC's Antelope Mine in central Wyoming on Wednesday. Over half of the 29 power stations served by this mine plan to cease coal use by 2035, including Colorado’s Rawhide plant, which is scheduled to switch from coal to natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar power by 2029.Peabody Energy, the largest US coal company, offers a more optimistic outlook. They estimate coal demand could increase by 250 million tonnes annually, nearly 50 per cent above current levels, citing delays in new nuclear and gas facilities. ""US coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" said Peabody president James Grech. ""The US has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.""Energy specialists remain sceptical. Umed Paliwal, an electricity market specialist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said:""Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market. The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.""No major coal power stations have opened in the US since 2013, and most existing facilities are over 40 years old. Experts suggest the administration’s $625 million modernisation fund may be insufficient, with a single boiler component costing up to $25 million, according to GridLab energy consultant Nikhil Kumar.","US authorities will conduct the nation’s largest coal auctions in over a decade.

EU Envoy Urges Both Sides to Engage in Earnest Efforts to Meet India-EU FTA Year-End Target





The potential free trade agreement (FTA) and investment protection pact between India and the EU could be a “game changer” amid rising tariffs and market access restrictions in other regions, said EU Ambassador Herve Delphin.Speaking ahead of the 14th round of FTA negotiations in Brussels, Delphin acknowledged that talks remain “challenging” with several unresolved issues. The comments come after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen committed to concluding the trade deal by December 2025.The EU is India’s largest trading partner, with goods trade reaching $135 billion in 2023-24. Delphin, addressing the Federation of European Business in India (FEBI) on Tuesday, highlighted the FTA’s potential to open new opportunities and strengthen bilateral trade ties, particularly in light of trade disruptions caused by policies under the Trump administration.""The FTA can open new opportunities for EU and Indian businesses and create conditions to significantly increase our bilateral trade and investment,"" Delphin said.""While some countries are raising tariffs or otherwise closing their markets, we should use the FTA to diversify trade, hedge against uncertainties and strengthen our supply chains,"" he further added at Federation of European Business in India (FEBI) on Tuesday, the script of which was released Saturday.EU Ambassador Herve Delphin also said the negotiating teams from India and the EU are working diligently on the free trade agreement (FTA).“(It is) fair to say the negotiations are challenging and important issues remain to be solved. The 13th round earlier in September with the direct involvement of Commissioners (Maros) Sefcovic and (Christophe) Hansen on the EU side did not result in the sort of breakthrough, which was expected,” he said.The 13th round of negotiations took place in Delhi, with European Commission Agriculture Commissioner Hansen and Trade Chief Sefcovic in attendance.Delphin added, “The EU was and is still ready to conclude on a meaningful package. We look forward to the next round and further negotiations towards a mutually beneficial deal.”According to the EU, while 11 chapters—including customs, dispute settlement, and digital trade—have been finalised, key areas such as rules of origin and market access are still under discussion. The 13th negotiation round in September, involving Commissioners Sefcovic and Hansen, did not yield the anticipated breakthrough.Delphin emphasised the EU’s readiness to conclude a meaningful deal, pointing to the strong economic complementarity between India and the EU. “Given that the EU and India represent the second and fourth largest economies globally, the potential for expanding bilateral trade relations is significant,” he said.","EU Ambassador Herve Delphin said the negotiating teams from India and the EU are working diligently on the free trade agreement (FTA) The EU is India’s largest trading partner, with goods trade reaching $135 billion in 2023-24.

"India’s services, manufacturing's export potential untapped; FDI a concern: World Bank South Asia chief economist",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-services-manufacturings-export-potential-untapped-fdi-a-concern-world-bank-south-asia-chief-economist/articleshow/124310435.cms,"Representative image





India’s services and manufacturing exports hold significant untapped potential for overseas investors, according to Franziska Ohnsorge, Chief Economist for South Asia at the World Bank “I draw attention to two opportunities for investment. One is in services exports and the other is in goods exports because it's the export industry rather than tradable industries that foreign investors tend to be interested in,” Ohnsorge told ANI on the sidelines of the Kautilya Economic Forum in New Delhi. She added that India’s strong government readiness for AI further strengthens this potential.Ohnsorge pointed to the rapid expansion of computer services exports, which surged 30 per cent following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, compared to a 10 per cent rise in overall services exports. “Computer services exports have been soaring relative to average services exports since the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022. So computer services exports have grown by 30 per cent, but overall services exports only by 10 per cent. There seem to be real opportunities in that sector,” she said.On manufacturing, she underlined constraints posed by limited trade agreements and high tariffs on intermediate goods.“India currently has much fewer trade agreements than other emerging markets and developing economies and has higher tariffs on intermediate goods and this is something that holds back its manufacturing sector. So I'll show that if these trade agreements that are currently under negotiation materialise, it would increase the market access of India's manufacturing industry by multiples,” she noted.India is currently negotiating free trade agreements (FTAs) with partners including the UK, EU, Oman, Canada, and members of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). Bilateral trade discussions with the US are also ongoing.On investment trends, she observed that private investment growth in India has slowed compared to pre-pandemic levels, but remains stronger than in most emerging markets. “Private investment growth has slowed in India from pre-pandemic rates to post-pandemic rates. And that is the opposite of what has happened in other emerging markets and developing economies. But even with this slowdown, private investment growth in India is still higher than the average for other emerging markets and developing economies. So by international standards, private investment growth is not weak. By India's standards, it's weak,” she explained.However, she flagged foreign direct investment (FDI) as a key area of concern. “What is weak by international standards is FDI. The FDI to GDP ratio in India is in the bottom quartile. Net FDI. GDP ratio is in the bottom quartile of emerging markets and developing economies,” she added.","India’s services and manufacturing exports hold significant untapped potential for overseas investors, according to Franziska Ohnsorge, Chief Economist for South Asia at the World Bank.Ohnsorge pointed to the rapid expansion of computer services exports, which surged 30 per cent following the launch of ChatGPT.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124310752,imgsize-710070,width-400,resizemode-4/article-87.jpg"

Amit Shah Sounds Big 'Swadeshi' Threat From Bastar, Urges 140 Crore People To Adopt Local Products

“स्वदेशी कपड़ा देश की शान—यही है भारत की पहचान”





The ministry of textiles has launched the ‘Swadeshi Campaign’ to boost domestic demand for handloom, handicrafts, and textile products across India. The initiative, which will run for six to nine months, aims to reposition Indian textiles as symbols of pride, style, and heritage, particularly among urban youth and Gen Z consumers.According to the government press release, the campaign’s objectives include stimulating domestic textile consumption, empowering weavers, artisans, and textile MSMEs, and aligning efforts with flagship government initiatives such as the PLI scheme for textiles, PM MITRA Parks, and One District One Product (ODOP). It will also encourage institutional procurement, urging ministries, PSUs, and educational institutions to adopt Indian-made textiles for uniforms and furnishings.Awareness will be created through events, social media outreach, and partnerships with state governments. The campaign will run under the slogan:(Swadeshi fabric is the pride of the nation—this is India’s identity).India’s textile and clothing market, valued at $179 billion in 2024, is expanding at an average annual growth rate of over 7 per cent. Household consumption accounts for 58 per cent of the domestic market and is growing at 8.19 per cent annually, while non-household consumption contributes 21 per cent with 6.79 per cent growth.With the government’s continued initiatives and the Swadeshi Campaign, domestic demand for textiles is projected to grow at a CAGR of 9–10 per cent, reaching $250 billion by 2030.","The ministry of textiles has launched the ‘Swadeshi Campaign’ to boost domestic demand for handloom, handicrafts, and textile products.

Inflation impact of raised MSP for Rabi crops limited; retail prices stable: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/inflation-impact-of-raised-msp-for-rabi-crops-limited-retail-prices-stable-report/articleshow/124309101.cms,"Representative image





The latest Minimum Support Price (MSP) increases for six rabi crops will likely have a modest effect on retail inflation, according to The ICICI Bank Global Markets report.The analysis indicates that whilst MSP adjustments influence inflation, their effectiveness is determined by various elements including buffer stock quantities, weather conditions, and supply chain reliability.The report indicates that adequate reservoir levels and sufficient buffer stocks should maintain stable retail food prices throughout the remaining year, despite the increased MSPs. ""However, we expect muted MSP hikes, good buffer stocks and higher reservoir levels to keep retail prices low in the remainder of the year,"" the report added, as quoted by ANI.The government declared revised MSPs on October 1, 2025, for the 2026-27 rabi marketing season, implementing increases between 4.0 per cent and 10.1 per cent for crops including wheat, barley, gram, lentils, mustard, and safflower.Following the Union Budget 2018-19 pledge, MSPs have been established at minimum 50 per cent above the all-India weighted average production costs. The returns exceed production expenses substantially--109 per cent for wheat, 89 per cent for lentils, and 93 per cent for rapeseed & mustard, demonstrating the administration's priority towards profitable farming and crop variety.For wheat, the primary rabi crop, the new MSP shows a 6.6 per cent rise to Rs 2,585 per quintal. Other increases include barley at Rs 2,150 (+8.6 per cent), gram at Rs 5,875 (+4.0 per cent), lentils (masur) at Rs 7,000 (+4.5 per cent), rapeseed & mustard at Rs 6,200 (+4.2 per cent), and safflower at Rs 6,540 (+10.1 per cent).The Consumer Price Index (CPI)-weighted average MSP increase is calculated at 5.6 per cent, showing a reduction from 5.9 per cent in 2025-26 and 5.8 per cent in 2024-25.","The government declared revised MSPs on October 1, 2025, for the 2026-27 rabi marketing season, implementing increases between 4.0 per cent and 10.1 per cent for crops including wheat, barley, gram, lentils, mustard, and safflower.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept its policy interest rate unchanged at 5.5 per cent for the second consecutive meeting, while retaining flexibility for future reductions. This comes after the monetary policy committee (MPC) significantly lowered its inflation projections, according to a Crisil Intelligence analysis cited by PTI.The central bank, in its October 1 review, expressed concerns over tariff-related uncertainties. The Crisil report noted that the MPC also flagged potential downside risks to GDP growth in the latter half of FY26, largely due to the impact of US tariffs.The analysis said the recent adjustments in GST rates would help offset some of these pressures. ""Certain labour-intensive sectors are most vulnerable to the impact of US tariffs and need policy support. With inflation becoming a less worry this fiscal, the initiation of US Federal Reserve's rate cuts will provide space for the RBI to cut rates,"" Crisil Intelligence said.Since February 2025, the RBI has cut its policy rate by 100 basis points. This included reductions of 25 bps each in February and April, followed by a 50 bps cut in June, bringing the repo rate down to 5.5 per cent.The government has mandated the RBI to maintain Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based retail inflation at 4 per cent, with a tolerance band of 2 per cent on either side.

NEW DELHI: India’s Rs 3,500 crore isabgol (psyllium husk) export industry is facing turbulence as processors threaten to halt seed procurement over unresolved Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) issues, adding to the pressure already caused by US tariffs.The US, which absorbs nearly 70% of India’s psyllium exports, has seen delays in shipments as buyers put orders on hold.Industry leaders say India’s global competitiveness is at stake. “Our exports have slowed down as buyers are postponing contracts due to uncertainty at our end,” said Ashwin Nayak, president of the All India Isabgol Processors Association (IPA), as quoted by ET.The root of the problem lies in ambiguous GST rules. While fresh isabgol attracts no GST and dried husk carries a 5% levy, there is no clarity on the tax treatment of isabgol seeds. Processors, to avoid compliance risks, have been paying GST on seed purchases from farmers. These payments are eventually refunded, but only after more than a year, causing severe working capital stress in an export-driven sector.“This prolonged blockage of funds has made it harder to sustain exports, especially when overseas buyers are already cautious due to trade barriers in the US,” said Rakesh Patel of Gujarat-based Sarvoday Sat Isabgol, reported ET.The industry has been seeking a clarification since 2017, but with little response from the GST council or the finance ministry, processors have now warned they will stop purchasing seeds from October 6.India is the world’s largest supplier of psyllium husk, a dietary fibre used in foods, pharmaceuticals, and wellness products. Rajasthan contributes about 70% of the crop, while Gujarat handles nearly 70% of its processing. Unjha in Gujarat, the hub of global isabgol trade, accounts for more than 80% of transactions.","India’s Rs 3,500 crore isabgol (psyllium husk) export industry is facing turbulence.

NEW DELHI: Vodafone Idea (Vi) has increased retailer commissions in a bid to boost its market presence and win back customers amid intense competition in India’s telecom sector.The telco, a joint venture between the UK’s Vodafone Group PLC and India’s Aditya Birla Group, launched 5G services in 22 cities in March.Vi is providing 3% commissions for recharges and new SIM activations, compared with 1% by Jio and 2% by Airtel, according to distributors and partners.The company, which began rolling out 5G services in key cities, is now offering commissions of up to 19% on select recharge plans, a sharp jump from the industry’s typical 3% rate.The operator is also offering higher incentives for mobile number portability (MNP), paying Rs 306 for port-ins versus Rs 187 for fresh activations. Additional MNP bonuses range from Rs 75 to Rs 100.“Vodafone's commission rates are the best and it has started giving better incentives,” said Manoj Kumar, a Delhi-based retailer, as quoted by ET.The telco is leaning on its physical retail network to drive growth. Over the past year, Vi has opened 100 new stores and is expanding mini stores.It runs a retailer program called 'Score kya hai', under which retailers earn redeemable points for every new customer addition. Points can be redeemed monthly via scratch cards, with quarterly and annual rewards including international trips.Alongside incentives, Vi is investing heavily in network expansion. Between October 2024 and June 2025, the company spent nearly Rs 9,800 crore on capex, adding over 4,800 new 4G towers. Its 4G population coverage increased from 77% to 84% in that period.Vi’s 5G services now operate in 22 cities across 13 circles, including Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Patna, Kochi, and Surat, with plans to expand coverage to all 17 circles where it holds 5G spectrum.The efforts have helped slow subscriber losses. Vi lost 0.5 million users in the April-June quarter, the lowest since the Vodafone India and Idea Cellular merger in 2018, compared to an average quarterly loss of 3.7 million in FY25, according to brokerage firm CLSA. The telco ended June with 198 million subscribers.“This (April-June) has been a decisive turnaround quarter,” said then chief executive Akshaya Moondra in August. “Investments made over the past three quarters to expand our 4G coverage have started yielding results, as reflected in the 90% lower subscriber loss compared to Q2 and Q3 of last financial year, being the lowest subscriber decline since merger,” he said, as quoted by ET.He added that data consumption during the quarter touched a record high.Vi has struggled with over 200 million subscriber losses since the merger amid high debt and limited cash flow, restricting capital expenditures. However, the company has raised around Rs 25,000 crore via equity in the past year, which has supported its 4G expansion and 5G rollout.","Vodafone Idea (Vi) has increased retailer commissions in a bid to boost its market presence.

New GST Rates Take Effect; Farmers, Shopkeepers, Consumers React to New Tax Structure

Trouble in low-priced packs

Companies call gaps temporary



E-commerce under the lens







NEW DELHI: Some FMCG companies and distributors are facing scrutiny after gaps emerged in passing GST benefits to consumers. Companies and distributors are pointing fingers at each other for pricing discrepancies in select packs, even as authorities prepare to take action against those not complying with the new GST rates.“Distributors can pass only what shows in the system from the companies’ end,” said the head of a major distributor group, speaking to ET on condition of anonymity. “A few large brands have increased base prices of some of their packs, which is not translating to lower prices.”The issue is particularly evident in packs priced at Rs 20 and below, according to industry and trade sources. Officials at the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) said they may initiate action against brands and ecommerce platforms that raised base prices after the GST reductions, noting that current laws provide the authority to act.The Delhi High Court ruled on September 30 that increasing product quantity without lowering MRP after a GST cut constitutes “deception”, emphasising that tax cuts are intended to make goods more affordable. FMCG executives pointed out practical difficulties in reducing prices for low-unit packs.“We are passing on the benefits of the GST reforms across our entire portfolio, through price reduction in some products and increased grammage in others,” said a spokesperson for Perfetti Van Melle India.Executives at companies including Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Colgate-Palmolive, Himalaya Wellness, and Perfetti Van Melle said that GST benefits are being fully passed on and that any pricing gaps are short-lived. Many companies have released advertisements highlighting updated prices for goods manufactured under reduced GST rates.“For a limited period, products with both the old and new MRPs may be available in the market, and consumers are advised to ask for revised MRPs before purchase,” said a spokesperson for HUL, as quoted by ET. “Trade partners have been communicated to ensure that the benefits of GST rate reductions are passed on to the end consumers.”HUL noted that it has implemented the reductions either by lowering prices or increasing product weight/volume to avoid odd pricing and simplify transactions. Colgate-Palmolive applied price reductions to existing inventory effective September 22, when new GST rates came into effect.“Consumers should expect to see the new prices on our new market packs by early November,” said Prabha Narasimhan, managing director of Colgate-Palmolive (India).The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has referred roughly 2,000 complaints to the CBIC. Officials said a separate team is reviewing transactions on ecommerce platforms, where the majority of consumer grievances have arisen.“Many large portals have updated their rate lists to reflect the new tax regime, but some issues are product-specific,” an official said.The government has contacted around 800 brands to fix technical glitches and system delays before October 20. A distributor added that numerous regional FMCG companies are still adjusting their systems to comply with the new GST rates.","Some FMCG companies and distributors are facing scrutiny after gaps emerged in passing GST benefits to consumers.

After five months of intensive redevelopment, the Dubai Fountain is set to officially reopen on Wednesday, October 1, 2025. Emaar has confirmed the date and shared details about a thorough two-phase upgrade designed to boost the fountain’s performance, technology, and overall visitor experience. With a revamped infrastructure, state-of-the-art robotics, and refreshed visuals, the iconic Downtown Dubai attraction is ready to return bigger and better than ever. Visitors can look forward to smoother, more precise shows featuring enhanced lighting, sharper choreography, and stunning water displays that promise to captivate both longtime fans and first-time viewers alike.The Dubai Fountain will resume operations on Wednesday, October 1, following a complete five-month shutdown that began on April 19, 2025. While speculation had circulated on social media in the weeks leading up to the confirmation, developer Emaar officially announced the reopening on September 27.The first show marking the grand return is scheduled for 6:30 PM on October 1. Regular showtimes will resume as follows:The reopening marks the completion of Phase One of the redevelopment project. Phase Two, introducing additional new features, is scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2026.The first phase involved a full-scale shutdown of the attraction, during which the entire 30-acre Burj Khalifa Lake was drained. This enabled major structural work, including:This deep structural work was essential to ensure both performance reliability and long-term maintenance efficiency, while preserving the fountain’s original grandeur.During this five-month closure, the site remained accessible visually. Emaar installed 500 metres of high-definition digital screens along the Dubai Mall promenade. These screens showcased looped archival footages of past performances in sync with the visuals of Burj Khalifa light displays, maintaining a sense of continuity and visitor engagement despite the ongoing construction.The redevelopment is more than cosmetic—it represents a fundamental reengineering of how the Dubai Fountain operates.Key upgrades now integrated include:These changes aim to deliver smoother motion, richer sensory experience, and overall improved show reliability. The system is designed to require less maintenance, reducing potential downtime in the future.Despite all the upgrades, the iconic identity of the Dubai Fountain remains intact, with water jets spraying up to 22,000 gallons of water as high as 150 metres into the air at any given time, illuminated by 6,600 lights and 25 colour projectors, all now performing on a more resilient and technologically advanced platform.The work isn’t fully complete. Emaar confirmed that the reopening marks only the end of the first phase. Phase Two, expected to conclude by Q2 2026, will introduce additional technological features and creative enhancements.While specific elements of the second phase are still under wraps, Emaar has emphasized that it will combine creativity and next-generation technology to continue evolving the fountain experience and deliver “fresh moments of wonder.”Mohamed Alabbar, Founder of Emaar, described the reopening as a symbolic moment for Dubai:The Dubai Fountain, originally launched on May 8, 2009, remains the largest choreographed fountain in the world, stretching 275 metres across the manmade lake beneath the Burj Khalifa. Designed by WET Design, the same creators behind the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas, it has long been a centrepiece of Downtown Dubai’s global allure.Now, with an entirely upgraded infrastructure and advanced show capabilities, it’s ready to reclaim its place in the city’s cultural spotlight—offering both returning and first-time visitors a renewed experience that blends technology, spectacle, and architectural ambition.The wait is over. The fountains are back.","The Dubai Fountain closed on April 19, 2025, for a five-month upgrade. The entire 30-acre Burj Khalifa Lake was drained to allow major structural upgrades.

Taylor Swift’s new album - Booster shot loading for the US economy?

US Federal Reserve’s challenges





The US economy is faced with the twin conundrum - growth challenges are mounting, and inflation is not in the US Federal Reserve’s comfort zone. At such a time, the release of Taylor Swift ’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, may spell good news for the central bank!Now, what does the release of a music album by a famous singer have to do with the economic decisions of the US Federal Reserve and its chair Jerome Powell? Confused? We explain.Taylor Swift has released her latest studio album, marking her twelfth record. Should this launch lead to another extensive concert tour, it would positively impact the economic objectives of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and fellow policymakers.According to a report by Barron’s, the last time Taylor Swift did a mega-tour, it resulted in a possible boost for the US economy. The economic influence of the Eras Tour, comprising 149 performances across five continents, remains challenging to quantify precisely. Nevertheless, various analyses indicate substantial economic effects. Nomura's economists calculated that the initial US portion of the tour stimulated consumer expenditure of $5 billion, including ticket sales and accommodation costs, the Barron’s report said.The Life of a Showgirl was unveiled early Friday. According to music analytics platform Chartmetric, the album achieved an unprecedented milestone by surpassing 5 million pre-saves on Spotify.Those attempting to capitalise on the release through stock investments might face disappointment, the report said. Universal Music Group, which owns Swift's label Republic Records, receives a portion of streaming and publishing earnings. However, the company's potential earnings might be restricted as Swift maintains ownership of her master recordings.Despite Target keeping numerous stores open until midnight for fans to purchase both regular and exclusive CD versions, their shares increased by merely 0.1% on Friday. The S&P 500 index recorded a 0.2% rise.However, Barron's report notes that the market cannot disregard The Life of a Showgirl entirely. The crucial consideration for investors centres on whether Swift will launch another extensive tour following this album.A multi-billion dollar economic stimulus, brought on as a result of a mega tour like last time, would be beneficial in the current climate, the report said.With employment figures declining whilst inflation exceeds 2%, the Federal Reserve faces significant challenges. Market analysts anticipate the central bank will implement interest rate reductions this month, followed by additional cuts in December, aiming to support employment levels.“The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen,” the FOMC statement said.Should The Life of a Showgirl generate a touring schedule comparable to Eras, Powell may have Swift to thank!","Taylor Swift has released her latest studio album, marking her twelfth record.

US stocks continued to climb on Friday, as Wall Street edged toward the finish of another record-setting week, buoyed by optimism around artificial intelligence and hopes of easier interest rates despite a partial government shutdown.The S&P 500 rose 0.2% and is on track for its seventh winning week in nine, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 167 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.2%, AP reported. All three indexes came off all-time highs set the previous day.Trading may see increased volatility later in the session as reports on the US services sector are released. Treasury yields in the bond market were largely steady ahead of the data.Normally, the first Friday of the month draws attention to the US government’s monthly jobs report, which details hiring and unemployment trends. But the third day of the partial shutdown has delayed the release, leaving investors and policymakers without fresh employment data.Past shutdowns have typically had limited impact on markets and the economy, though President Donald Trump has threatened large-scale firings of federal workers this time.Investors remain focused on AI-related developments, which have propelled the market in recent weeks. The sector received a boost after Japan’s Hitachi signed a memorandum of understanding with OpenAI, following similar agreements with South Korean firms. Hitachi’s stock surged 10.3% in Tokyo, while US tech giants Nvidia and Broadcom rose 0.6% and 1.5%, respectively.However, caution persists over the sector’s rapid growth, with some analysts warning of a potential bubble that could disappoint investors. Applied Materials was among the day’s losers, dropping 2.5% after warning of a roughly $110 million revenue impact in Q4 due to expanded US export restrictions on certain Chinese customers.Global markets were mixed, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 1.9%, while European indexes showed varied performance. In the US bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield inched down to 4.09% from 4.10% late Thursday.","The S&P 500 is on track for its seventh winning week in nine.

The United States has delayed the release of a key employment report as a partial government shutdown entered its third day on Friday, creating uncertainty over the state of the world’s largest economy.Other economic indicators scheduled for publication this week, including weekly unemployment claims, have also been postponed, depriving policymakers and businesses of crucial information for decision-making, AFP reported.The shutdown has already led to hundreds of thousands of federal employees being sent home without pay across multiple agencies. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that approximately 750,000 employees could be furloughed daily if funding lapses continue.The US labor market has been under close scrutiny in recent months following signs of slowing hiring, which prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the first time in 2025. The absence of updated official data has raised concerns about the Fed’s ability to make fully informed monetary policy decisions.“Without up-to-date data, the Federal Reserve will not have the full picture it needs to make decisions this month about interest rates that will impact every family across the country,” warned Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.

US job cuts - grim picture





The US economy is staring at a prospect where its job losses for the year could cross 1 million! Nearly 95,00,00 layoffs have happened by US employers through September 2025, marking the highest such figures since 2020, according to outplacement specialists Challenger, Gray & Christmas quoted in a CBS report.The increase in workforce reductions coincides with a slowdown in the labour market, with organisations significantly reducing their recruitment plans, as employment data indicates. Firms are planning to recruit 58% fewer staff for the remainder of the year compared to their projections from the previous year.Challenger, Gray & Christmas predicts the job cuts might exceed 1 million in 2025. Whilst current job losses are significant, they remain considerably lower than the 2020 figures, when pandemic-related business closures resulted in 2 million layoffs through September that year, according to Challenger's analysis.""Previous periods with this many job cuts occurred either during recessions or, as was the case in 2005 and 2006, during the first wave of automations that cost jobs in manufacturing and technology,"" said Andy Challenger, senior vice president and labour expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas according to the CBS report.Additional job losses might result from the government shutdown, as the White House Office of Management and Budget has instructed federal agencies to consider staff reductions during any closure period.The upcoming October 3 government jobs report is expected to be delayed due to the federal shutdown, with economists projecting 50,000 new jobs added last month according to FactSet data.In light of the delayed government report, economists are turning to alternative labor market indicators to assess employment conditions.ADP's private sector employment report showed a decline of 32,000 jobs in September.There are indications that job cuts may be slowing down. Challenger's latest data revealed businesses announced approximately 54,000 job cuts in September, marking a significant 37% decrease from August's nearly 86,000 announced cuts.Economists are closely monitoring these various employment metrics to gauge the overall health of the labor market during the government shutdown period.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced a 0.25 percentage point reduction in the benchmark interest rate, citing concerns about worker challenges, with plans for two more rate cuts in 2025. The Fed is closely monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness.Lower borrowing costs could provide support to the job market, as businesses would have greater capacity to expand and hire when interest rates decrease.The labor market is currently facing multiple challenges, according to Challenger.""Right now, we're dealing with a stagnating labor market, cost increases and a transformative new technology. With rate cuts on the way, we may see some stabilizing in the job market in the fourth quarter, but other factors could keep employers planning layoffs or holding off hiring,"" Challenger said.The Federal Reserve's actions reflect its ongoing efforts to balance economic growth with labor market stability through monetary policy adjustments.","The US economy is staring at a prospect where its job losses for the year could cross 1 million.

Russian-Ukraine conflict: EU plans to use Moscow's frozen assets to fund Kyiv; here's how,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/russian-ukraine-conflict-eu-plans-to-use-moscows-frozen-assets-to-fund-kyiv-heres-how/articleshow/124289703.cms,"'Ukraine Surviving On Western Money': Hungary Slams Kyiv After Drone Intrusion Charge

Redirecting frozen funds





Size of the pot





Legal workaround





Who takes the risk









The European Union is working on a new financial plan to support Ukraine’s defence and rebuilding efforts by tapping into Russian central bank assets frozen in the West since Moscow’s invasion.Directly seizing these sovereign assets is banned under international law, so the European Commission has proposed a workaround that would allow EU governments to use the funds without technically confiscating them, Reuters reported.The plan involves using most of the 210 billion euros worth of Russian assets currently frozen in Europe, a sensitive issue for many EU capitals and the European Central Bank.The proposal has drawn broad political backing in principle, but several member states want more legal clarity before moving forward.Belgium, which hosts the Euroclear clearing house and has an annual national output of around 600 billion euros, has been particularly cautious about the financial and legal risks involved.When Russia launched its full-scale war in Ukraine, Euroclear held Russian central bank bonds. As these bonds matured, the proceeds were frozen under EU sanctions. The Commission’s plan would see these frozen cash balances channelled to the EU.In exchange, Euroclear would receive zero-coupon bonds from the Commission of the same value. The EU would then use the cash to issue what it calls a “Reparations Loan” to Ukraine.Kyiv would only repay this loan once it receives war reparations from Moscow in a future peace settlement, giving it access to the money immediately instead of waiting for compensation from Russia.Around $300 billion of Russian assets have been frozen worldwide. Of that, 210 billion euros ($229 billion) is held in Europe, with 185 billion euros managed by Euroclear in Brussels. Roughly 176 billion euros is already in cash, and another 9 billion euros in securities is set to mature in 2026.The EU would first use part of this to repay the 45 billion euros ($50 billion) G7 loan agreed with Ukraine last year, leaving about 140 billion euros to finance the new loan. The exact amount will depend on an International Monetary Fund assessment of Ukraine’s financial needs in 2026 and 2027. Finland and Sweden estimate that Kyiv will face a shortfall of around 130 billion euros during that period, Reuters reported.To avoid breaching international rules, the cash would be moved from Euroclear into a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) owned by EU or G7 governments. The Commission would then issue zero-coupon bonds to Euroclear, backed by the SPV. This structure is meant to protect Euroclear from legal challenges while allowing the EU to use the funds for investment rather than leaving them idle in overnight deposits at the European Central Bank.Russia has rejected the plan, describing it as an “illegal seizure” and warning of retaliatory measures.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said the risk would be shared among EU countries. The plan would need full guarantees from member states, with contributions proportionate to the size of their economies.Belgium has made it clear it does not want to shoulder the risk alone. Prime Minister Bart de Wever told EU leaders that Belgium’s hosting of Euroclear should not make it the only party accountable.“If we take (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's money, we use it, we're all going to be responsible if it goes wrong,” he said.He also insisted on strong legal assurances before Belgium signs off on the plan.",EU working on plan to tap into Russian central bank assets frozen in the West since Moscow’s invasion.

American farmers are looking at losing billions of dollars as Chinese importers have refused to buy US soybeans due to tensions between the two nations. To ease the blow, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent announced that the government will be rolling out new support measures for the farming sector.Bessent told CNBC that the federal government stands behind the farming community, which backed President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. “We’ve got their backs,” he said.“It’s unfortunate that Chinese leadership has decided to use the American farmers, soybean farmers in particular, as a hostage or pawn in the trade negotiations,” Bessent told Reuters.Trump on Wednesday said that soybeans would be a major topic of discussion when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping in four weeks.Bessent explained that buying American farm products is part of nearly every recent US trade deal. “So we’re going to see other countries substitute for China,” he said.However, despite efforts by the administration and the soybean industry, no other markets have come close to matching China’s usual purchase volumes. A record harvest has also added pressure on prices.Bessent said he met Trump and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins in the Oval Office on Wednesday.He asked farmers to expect “substantial support” to be announced on Tuesday, particularly for soybean growers.“On Tuesday, you’re going to see substantial support for the farmers, and we’re also going to be working with the Farm Credit Bureau to make sure that the farmers have what they need for next planting season,” he said.He added that an in-person meeting between Trump and Xi would help set the direction for future trade.“I think with President Trump's leadership and his relationship - the respect party chair Xi has for him - that this round, which would be our fifth round of talks, should show a pretty big breakthrough,” Bessent said.","Chinese importers have refused to buy US soybeans due to tensions between the two nations.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that he is considering giving Americans up to $2,000 in rebates from revenues generated by his tariff policies, calling the payments a “dividend to the people of America. ”“They’re just starting to kick in,” Trump said in an interview with One America News Network, referring to the tariffs imposed on foreign nations since April. “Ultimately, your tariffs are going to be over a trillion dollars a year,” he added.When the reporter asked about the potential size of the rebate, the US president declared, “We’re thinking maybe $1,000 to $2,000 – it would be great.”Trump said the funds would first be used to reduce the US national debt, currently at $37 trillion, which he described as “very little, relatively speaking” given the surge in government revenue from tariffs.“Number one, we’re paying down debt,” Trump stated, “because people have allowed the debt to go crazy.”“With that being said, we’ll pay back debt, but we also might make a distribution to the people,” he added.According to Treasury data cited by Fox Business, the federal government has collected approximately $214.9 billion from tariffs so far this year. September's tariff revenue reached $31.3 billion, $73 million lower than August's record.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had earlier projected that the total tariff revenue could reach at least $300 billion by year-end.The proposal comes as the Supreme Court prepares to hear a case in early November to determine whether the president has the authority to impose broad tariffs.Earlier rulings by lower courts and the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit questioned the legality of most of Trump’s levies but allowed them to remain in effect pending appeal.Bessent also asserted the top court that if the tariffs are ruled illegal, the government could be required to refund between $750 billion and $1 trillion in collected and projected revenue.","US President Donald Trump said he is considering giving Americans up to $2,000 in rebates from revenues generated by his tariff policies.

Berkshire Hathaway to acquire OxyChem for $9.7 billion: Last major deal under Warren Buffett's leadership?

Warren Buffett-owned Berkshire Hathaway is set to acquire Occidental Petroleum’s chemical division, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion, marking possibly the last major deal under the billionaire investor who owns the firm, set to retire by year-end.Notably, Buffett's name was absent from Thursday's announcement materials, as reported by Associated Press, suggesting a transition of leadership to Vice Chair Greg Abel, who will become CEO in January.Although Buffett will retain his position as chairman at Berkshire and continue to influence decisions regarding the company's substantial cash reserves exceeding $344 billion.The conglomerate's cash has accumulated as Buffett struggled to identify attractively priced major acquisitions since purchasing Alleghany Insurance for $11.6 billion in 2022. Increased competition from hedge funds has driven acquisition prices higher.OxyChem produces essential chemicals including chlorine for water treatment, vinyl chloride for plastics and calcium chloride for road de-icing. The business will complement Berkshire's existing chemical subsidiary, Lubrizol, acquired in 2011 for $9 billion.""Berkshire is acquiring a robust portfolio of operating assets, supported by an accomplished team,"" Abel said in a prepared statement.""We look forward to welcoming OxyChem as an operating subsidiary within Berkshire,"" he further said as quoted by AP.OxyChem's pretax earnings fell to $213 million in the second quarter, compared to nearly $300 million previously. Occidental has been divesting Permian Basin assets, generating $950 million for debt reduction. Following the December 2023 CrownRock acquisition, Occidental has sold approximately $4 billion in assets to address $7.5 billion in debt.Occidental plans to utilise $6.5 billion from the Berkshire transaction to reduce debt below their $15 billion target, established after the CrownRock acquisition.Prior to this deal, Berkshire owned over 28% of Occidental's stock, with warrants for an additional 83,911,942.38 shares at $59.586 each. Additionally, Berkshire held $8.5 billion in preferred Occidental shares from 2019, earning 8% annual dividends.While Buffett previously committed to maintaining Occidental stakes and continued purchasing shares, he informed shareholders in 2023 that complete acquisition wasn't planned.Berkshire's diverse portfolio includes insurance companies like Geico, BNSF railway, utilities, and renowned brands such as Dairy Queen and See's Candy, built over 60 years.

US stock markets at record high: S&P 500 and Nasdaq surge; rate cut hopes boost optimism despite government shutdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-markets-hit-record-highs-sp-500-and-nasdaq-surge-dow-jones-rate-cut-hopes-boost-optimism-despite-government-shutdown/articleshow/124275084.cms,"AI image





The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices reached unprecedented levels when markets opened on Thursday, driven by fresh optimism regarding potential interest rate reductions, whilst investors prepare for minimal economic data releases as the week concludes.At market opening, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 20.0 points, representing a 0.04% increase, reaching 46,461.11. The S&P 500 advanced by 20.1 points or 0.30%, opening at 6,731.31, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 130.7 points, equivalent to 0.57%, touching 22,885.905 at the start of trading.Technology stocks surged again following OpenAI’s announcement of partnerships with South Korean firms for its Stargate AI infrastructure project. Additionally, Nvidia rose 1.7 percent at the start of trading, while other tech firms remained in focus due to broader AI-related optimism. Tesla shares also climbed 1.6 percent after reporting a 7 percent increase in third-quarter sales.Stock indexes also climbed across Europe and Asia, while Treasury yields remained relatively steady after a US government shutdown delayed the weekly unemployment claims report. The US government went on a formal shutdown on October 1 after Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement on federal fundingMeanwhile, Wall Street is hoping the US job market slows just enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to continue cutting interest rates—but not so much that it triggers a recession.Striking this balance is tricky, and delays in government economic reports add to the uncertainty. With stocks already hitting record highs on expectations of rate cuts, any sign that the cuts may not materialize could push the market lower.Investors currently expect nearly a 99 percent chance of a Fed rate cut later this month and an 87 percent chance of another cut in December.Wednesday’s ADP report showed the US private sector shed jobs in September, contrary to expectations of growth. Analysts said the weak data strengthens the case for Fed rate cuts in the coming months, though a partial government shutdown has delayed key economic reports, adding uncertainty.“The data emboldens calls for the Fed to ease rates in the months ahead,” said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, as quoted by AFP.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 20.0 points, representing a 0.04% increase, reaching 46,461.11.

EU steel tariffs: European Commission plans higher duties; aim to protect local producers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-steel-tariffs-european-commission-plans-higher-duties-aim-to-protect-local-producers/articleshow/124270888.cms,"EU Envoy Urges Both Sides to Engage in Earnest Efforts to Meet India-EU FTA Year-End Target





The European Union is preparing to increase tariffs on steel imports as part of a push to protect local producers from cheap Asian steel and new trade barriers from the United States.The European Commission is expected to unveil a permanent plan next week, which will also slash the EU’s existing steel quotas for foreign steel by nearly 50%, EU industry chief Stephane Sejourne said, according to a source cited by Bloomberg.Under the new system, imports above the reduced quotas will face higher tariffs, similar to the US, which currently charges a 50% duty on imported steel.At present, the EU operates a temporary safeguard that imposes a 25% tariff once quotas are exceeded. That arrangement is due to expire next year, prompting the Commission to design a more lasting solution to replace it.The move comes as EU leaders meet in Copenhagen to discuss boosting the bloc’s defence capabilities.“Our reality today and tomorrow is security and security means armaments and armaments means steel,” Polish PM Donald Tusk said.“We have to protect our companies, our steel companies in Europe and in Poland,” Bloomberg quoted Tusk as saying.Europe’s steel industry has been under pressure for years from cheap imports from China and other Asian countries, which was further intensified by the US raising steel and aluminium tariffs to 50% shortly after Donald Trump took office.Sejourne added that while the EU supports free international trade, “we will not be the only ones to impose on ourselves the principles that others no longer apply,” according to someone familiar with his remarks.The proposal coincides with discussions on stricter EU climate targets for 2040, which could add further strain on energy-intensive industries such as steel, according to Bloomberg.Europe’s steel body, Eurofer, has called for stricter measures to match changing market conditions and urged a full post-2026 trade framework to tackle the harmful impact of global steel overcapacity on the EU market.“This is the first real measure to support our sector, and support quality jobs in Europe,” said director general Axel Eggert. “But there needs to be more.”","The European Commission is expected to unveil a permanent plan next week.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country. CEA said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105332515,imgsize-39018,width-400,resizemode-4/105332515.jpg"

TCS Benching Policy: Industry Impact

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employees are worried about layoffs as the first round of the new benching policy at India’s largest IT services giant ends. Several TCS employees appear to be taking to social media platforms like Reddit to express their concerns about their role and future in TCS.The newly implemented benching guidelines effective from June 12 restrict the non-billable period to 35 days annually, beyond which employees could face professional setbacks or possible job loss.According to an ET report, employees have reported various challenges, including urgent project searches, assignments in mismatched skill areas, unsuccessful client interviews, and difficulties securing projects in preferred locations.A concerned Reddit participant was quoted as saying, ""This is the first step towards employment rationalisation based on utilisation. Brace for layoffs.""A new recruit shared, ""I have recently joined TCS and training was conducted in Java. Now, it's not even a month on bench and RMG is pressuring me to join a *** support project, far from Java and Python.""However, the financial daily could not verify the veracity of the posts on Redditt.Explaining the revised bench policy, TCS chief executive and managing director K Krithivasan told Times of India: ""It's always been expected that associates take responsibility for their careers. While HR supports project placement, we also expect associates to proactively seek new assignments after completing existing ones. What you're seeing now is simply a more structured version of what's long been in practice. We aim to minimise bench time.""Also Read | Infosys vs Cognizant fight gets uglier! Why are the two big IT firms battling it out in the US? Explained The company prioritises substantial investment in employee development. ""Once we've made that investment, we work to ensure associates are deployed,"" he said. ""While preferences are considered, projects are driven by client needs, not personal choice. We deploy based on training, demand, and skill alignment. If gaps exist, we work to close them before deployment.""When questioned about TCS withholding salaries for staff on extended bench periods, Krithivasan offered no direct response.The exact impact on the TCS workforce remains uncertain. Based on industry data, approximately 15-18% of employees at major Indian IT companies typically remain on bench. TCS, which leads India's IT sector, currently employs around 613,000 individuals.Last week a workers' rights organisation approached Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya, requesting immediate intervention regarding TCS's bench policy, which they described as ""inhumane,"" ""exploitative"" and mentally taxing for technology professionals.Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) submitted a formal complaint to the minister, claiming that TCS is pressuring benched employees through termination threats and withholding experience certificates if they cannot secure project assignments within specified timeframes.Also Read | TCS gives out variable pay! Over 70% employees to get 100% variable; no decision yet on salary hikes ""These are not non-performing employees, but skilled professionals who find themselves temporarily without allocation… Instead of support, they are met with suspicion, coercion, and threats,"" NITES president Harpreet Singh Saluja said in the letter.Some staff members are however backing TCS' decision, noting that numerous employees have stayed unassigned for extended periods, turning down offered projects. These individuals have used their unallocated time for pursuing additional qualifications whilst not contributing to the organisation's productivity.""This may help TCS trimming some seriously underperforming resources, those stuck on TCS like a leech,"" a Reddit user posted.The IT sector anticipates significant changes as artificial intelligence (AI) begins to automate routine operations.""We expect IT companies to become stricter with their bench policies due to the soft business environment and AI-led demand for advanced skill sets,"" Pareekh Jain, founder and CEO of EIIRTrend told ET. He observed that staff expenses are notably affecting company profit margins.The stringent bench policy implemented by TCS might influence other IT firms, as managing bench strength becomes increasingly challenging due to AI-driven productivity improvements making it harder to reassign entry-level engineers, according to industry specialists.""Tech companies must continuously align their employees' skill sets with evolving client needs. By revisiting their bench policies, organisations are encouraging employees to reskill and stay relevant in high-demand areas such as AI, cybersecurity, and digital engineering,"" said Nitin Bhatt, technology sector leader at EY India according to the financial daily’s report.""Going forward, tenure and grade-based promotions and merit increases will likely be replaced by assessments of skills proficiency and competencies required to take on new roles,"" he added.Also Read | ‘Character assassination’: Delhi HC asks Wipro to pay Rs 2 lakh for defamation of ex-employee; termination letter full of ‘stigma and insinuations’","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employees are worried about layoffs as the first round of the new benching policy at India’s largest IT services giant ends.

Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd shares his outlook on gold prices and strategy for gold investors:

Gold Price Outlook:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are expected to remain steady as global economic events continue to shape the yellow metal’s price outlook.Silver took centre stage last week, outshining most commodities by hitting an all-time high of ₹1,15,000 domestically and marking its highest COMEX level since 2012 near $40, before facing some profit booking. The rally was driven by strong industrial demand, supportive ETP flows, and a catch-up move relative to gold. Meanwhile, gold traded steady, supported by safe-haven flows after US President Trump threatened a 30% tariff on EU and Mexico imports from August 1.The EU responded by extending its suspension of countermeasures in hopes of a negotiated settlement. Tensions cooled somewhat as Trump later signalled openness to further talks. Market attention also turned to US inflation, which rose the most in five months in June, hinting that tariffs may be seeping into prices. Despite this, producer prices softened and industrial production showed modest recovery. Comments from Fed officials signaled a cautious stance, with expectations of rate cuts by year-end still intact.Brief uncertainty also rose as rumour rose that US President Donald Trump might initiate the process of firing Governor Powell, but quickly denied the same.Amid these developments, India's gold imports in June fell to a two-year low as high prices dented demand. It will be important to check how the negotiations between the US and other countries go, esp. China, EU, India, Russia and other major trading nations.This week’s key triggers include US durable goods orders, manufacturing and services PMIs, China’s loan prime rate decision, and Fed Chair Powell’s speech—all of which could provide clarity on the Fed’s next steps and impact precious metals momentum.Recovery in China is boosting the overall optimism in the market, however now it will be important to see along with economic numbers whether they loosen their policy further or leave it as it is. Lastly, it will be important to see whether Governor Powell’s speech shows President Trump’s recent threat or does he stay put on his “wait-and-watch” stance. Any sign of pressure could support bullion from lower levels.Stance: Sideways to Higher - Rs 96,000 to 99,500","Gold prices are expected to remain steady as global economic events continue to shape the yellow metal’s price outlook.

Understanding SGB Redemption Price Calculation

Investment Returns Analysis



SGB Interest Payment Structure

Is there flexibility to redeem SGBs before maturity?

What is the process for exiting an SGB investment?

Soverign Gold Bond redemption: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced the early redemption value for Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) 2018-19 Series-V. Investors can opt for early redemption only after holding the bonds for five years from the issue date.According to RBI, the above mentioned SGB is up for early redemption on Tuesday, July 22, 2025. These gold bonds reach maturity after an 8-year period from their issue date.Sovereign Gold Bonds or SGBs are in essence government-backed securities that are measured in grams of gold. They serve as an alternative to investment in physical gold. Investors need to make cash payments for purchasing these bonds, and upon maturity, they receive cash settlements. The Government of India authorises the Reserve Bank of India to manage the issuance of these bonds.We take a look at the early redemption value, potential returns from choosing premature redemption, and other details as listed in an ET report:For SGBs due for early redemption on July 22, 2025, the redemption value is set at Rs 9,820 per unit. This calculation considers the average closing gold prices over three business days: July 17, 2025, July 18, 2025, and July 21, 2025.""The redemption price of SGB shall be based on the simple average of the closing gold price of 999 purity of the previous three business days from the date of redemption, as published by the India Bullion and Jewellers Association Ltd (IBJA),” says RBI in its July 21, 2025 release.The initial issue price of SGB 2018-19 Series-V in January 2019 was Rs 3214 per gram. The absolute gain amounts to Rs 6,606 (Rs 9,820 - Rs 3214), excluding interest earnings. This represents a substantial return of 205.56% on the investment.For investors Sovereign Gold Bonds mean a fixed annual interest of 2.50% on the principal investment amount. The interest payments are credited twice a year directly to the investor's bank account. The final interest crediting happens at maturity in addition to the principal amount.Whilst the bonds have an 8-year tenure, early redemption is permitted after five years from issuance on specified coupon payment dates. When held in demat format, these bonds can be traded on exchanges. Additionally, they are transferable to other qualified investors.If you want to opt for early redemption, you have to contact your bank/SHCIL offices/Post Office/agent 30 days before to the coupon payment date. Early redemption requests are processed only if they ate submitted at least one day before the coupon payment date. The redemption amount is then transferred to the bank account specified during the bond application.","Sovereign Gold Bonds or SGBs are government-backed securities measured in grams of gold.

AI skilled freshers

BENGALURU: Technology companies are facing a significant shortfall in AI-specialised talent, with just 15-20% of the workforce trained in artificial intelligence. This has prompted a shift in hiring strategies across the sector.From major IT services firms like HCLTech to digital engineering players like Publicis Sapient and emerging AI startups such as StaqU, the message is consistent: the available talent pool is struggling to match the rapidly growing demand. ""There just aren't that many people in the market with AI skills,"" said Shefali Sharma Garg, chief people officer at Publicis Sapient. ""Our approach is to hire agile talent who can evolve as AI matures. It's moving fast, and adaptability is key.""The most sought-after roles include engineers skilled in building, training, and deploying AI models, as well as professionals capable of working alongside intelligent systems to drive business outcomes. As a result, compensation for individuals with specialised AI expertise has spiked. HCLTech reports offering up to four times the standard entry-level salary for freshers with niche AI competencies.""We focus on quality over quantity,"" said Ramachandran Sundararajan, chief people officer at HCLTech. ""Roughly 15-20% of our campus intake this year will be specialised hires, and we're happy to expand that if more candidates meet our benchmark.""At Gurugram-based AI startup StaqU, the recruitment model revolves around hiring young, self-taught engineers - even before they graduate. ""We don't hire based on years of experience,"" said Atul Rai, CEO and co-founder. ""We evaluate GitHub contributions, community feedback, and research output. Someone with two years of hands-on GitHub work in AI is more valuable to us than someone with two decades in Java.""Yet, sourcing such talent remains a challenge. Rai highlights a broader issue: India's limited research infrastructure and funding prevent it from building foundational AI models on par with countries like the US and China. ""We're not building LLMs. We're building applications on top of them - and for that, we need adaptable AI engineers, not just coders,"" he added.The shortage is also evident at E2E Networks, a cloud-native company empanelled by MeitY. ""AI has no fixed curriculum. What's in demand today didn't exist two years ago,"" said Mohammed Imran, CTO of E2E. ""Only two out of 10 candidates clear our AI hiring process.""This gap is mirrored in broader industry data. According to a recent Bain & Company report, AI-related job postings have grown at an annual rate of 21% since 2019, with salaries rising by 11%. Still, the supply of skilled professionals hasn't kept pace. Bain projects that India's AI industry will generate 2.3 million jobs by 2027. However, the talent pool is estimated to reach just 1.2 million-leaving over a million positions to be filled through upskilling and training initiatives.",Technology companies are facing a significant shortfall in AI-specialised talent.

MUMBAI: RBI deputy governor Swaminathan J has asked new age bankers to guard against new vulnerabilities of cyber threats, phishing, synthetic identities, deepfakes, and third-party risks.Addressing graduating students at the National Institute of Bank Management (NIBM) in Pune last week, Swaminathan said they must balance the speed and scale offered by technology with a strong sense of vigilance and personal responsibility. ""Banking today is more complex than ever,"" he said, pointing to the rise in real-time and frictionless transactions. ""As transactions become real-time and frictionless, the time it takes for damage to occur-and spread-has drastically shortened. ""He said that while digital tools enable efficiency, they have also made banks more vulnerable to new risks. ""Vigilance is no longer optional; it is an essential and core professional skill.""Drawing on the Titanic as an analogy, he cautioned that institutions fail not always due to a lack of systems, but due to a lack of foresight. ""It is not always the biggest or most advanced systems that succeed. It is the ones that stay alert, that course-correct early, and that respect the value of foresight.""He urged young bankers to think like lookouts on a ship. ""You must be that lookout-always asking: 'What is on the horizon? What could go wrong? What needs attention before it's too late?' In a rapidly evolving environment, those who notice the iceberg early-not the ones explaining the damage afterward-will make the real difference.""While digital transformation is critical, Swaminathan warned that technology alone cannot build trust. ""We see increasing automation but decreasing ownership. Systems respond with templated emails; helplines loop back endlessly. This is not how trust is built, and certainly not how it can be sustained.""He shared that customer complaints, particularly through digital channels, have increased significantly, often not due to product failures but due to a lack of empathy. ""A senior citizen struggling with an ATM pin... a borrower in a rural area unsure how to repay digitally... a small business owner worried about a UPI refund... they are not just service requests. They are moments of trust.""Swaminathan drew a lesson on the importance of conventions and professional judgment from the practice of crossing cheques with ""account payee."" He pointed out that this practice, though not mandated by any specific statute, has become a time-honoured convention that enhances the safety of transactions and limits misuse.""There is no specific statute mandating it-but it is a time-honoured convention that enhances safety and limits misuse,"" he said.

Govt plans minimum import price for key pharma inputs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-plans-minimum-import-price-for-key-pharma-inputs/articleshow/122847215.cms,"Representational Image

Move may cover 10 raw materials

NEW DELHI: As geopolitics disrupts global trade, govt is planning to impose a minimum import price (MIP) on key pharmaceutical raw materials to protect the domestic industry and secure supply chains. This step is meant to shield the domestic pharma industry from a surge of cheap Chinese imports that local manufacturers claim are hurting them.MIP is a tool in addition to customs duty, often used to make imports expensive. For instance, in case of apples, govt imposes MIP and then levies customs duty on it.The move could cover around 10 key raw materials (drug intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients), including those for antibiotics and anti-cholesterol therapies, imported from China, sources told TOI. Significantly, the raw materials selected for this exercise are part of the 41 critical components identified under the govt's Product-linked Incentive (PLI) scheme introduced to boost domestic manufacturing capabilities and reduce import dependence.Even in case of mobile handsets, covered under PLI, govt had offered protection to let domestic manufacturing stabilise.Discussions between the pharmaceutical industry and govt have been underway and a final decision is expected soon, sources added.Industry experts point out that ""since the announcement of the PLI scheme, China has further slashed prices of key raw materials, particularly over the last couple of years. Hence, due to predatory pricing, certain imports are significantly lower than initially expected. This is creating significant competitive pressure on domestic companies. Govt should assess on a case-by-case basis and decide where the MIP should be imposed. ""The proposed MIP, however, has led to a debate among the manufacturers of finished formulations. ""If we have to pay more for buying raw materials and intermediates, our production costs will rise,"" said a leading pharmaceutical player, expressing concern over potential cost pressures.Last year, govt had imposed an MIP on soda ash, among the first such moves in several years. Soda ash is the basic raw material in soaps and detergents, glass manufacturing, and certain chemicals.","MIP is a tool in addition to customs duty, often used to make imports expensive.

India Not Worried About Trump’s Russia Oil Threat Or NATO Sanction: Puri Hits Back With Oil Strategy

What are the EU sanctions on Russia ?

Russia oil sanctions impact: Indian exporters will likely face challenges from the European Unin’s decision to sanction oil supply with Russia as its source of origin. The European Union 's ban on Russian crude-derived fuels, set to take effect from January 21 next year, may provide momentary respite in terms of implementation.However, its stringent classification of Russia-origin fuels could create difficulties for Indian exporters.The EU unveiled its newest sanctions against Russia last week, incorporating limitations on fuel imports processed from Russian crude oil. This development could affect Reliance Industries , which maintains has Russian oil imports whilst exporting considerable fuel volumes to European markets, according to an ET report.Also Read | 'We're going to crush your economy': US Senator warns India, China, Brazil over 'cheap' Russian oil; threatens to 'tariff the hell out' On Monday, Reliance Industries' shares declined by 3.3% to ₹1,428.20, despite the BSE Sensex benchmark rising by 0.5%. This drop followed several brokerage reports indicating the company's earnings fell short of projections.

'Reaping the rewards': Why short-term investors leaning towards ICICI Bank over HDFC Bank?

These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Short-term investors are leaning towards ICICI Bank in the private banking space, thanks to its solid June quarter results. With strong profit growth and steady margins, ICICI is currently edging out rival HDFC Bank in investor preference.HDFC Bank is currently dealing with various post-merger issues, notably an elevated credit-deposit (CD) ratio, which has affected investor confidence. The high CD ratio indicates that deposit growth is not keeping pace with credit expansion.Despite both institutions maintaining premier banking networks across India, analysts note ICICI's current advantageous position.""ICICI Bank is reaping the rewards of a well-executed transformation, showing clarity and consistency, while HDFC Bank navigates a transitional phase post-merger,"" Shrikant Chouhan, head, equity research, Kotak Securities told ET.Following its June quarter results and weekend announcements regarding dividend and bonus issue, HDFC Bank shares increased by over 2% on Monday.ICICI Bank shares rose nearly 3% after reporting healthy profit growth, supported by stable net interest margins and robust asset quality. HDFC Bank's performance has raised some concerns.Post-merger, with its CD ratio remaining in the 90s, the bank faces difficulties in efficient liquidity deployment, affecting immediate loan growth and NIMs.ICICI Bank's superior near-term earnings visibility makes it more attractive to short-term investors.""ICICI Bank seems to be a preferred pick with its robust asset quality, strong capital position and sustained profitability momentum,"" Prashanth Tapse, senior VP (research), Mehta Equities told ET.Regarding HDFC Bank, Tapse notes that the stock's underperformance is likely to continue due to valuation adjustments and subdued post-merger earnings.Although ICICI Bank is currently preferred, analysts maintain close observation of HDFC Bank. The institution has projected to surpass industry growth in FY27 earnings and match industry performance in FY26.For short to medium-term investors seeking stability and earnings visibility, ICICI Bank remains the preferred choice, according to market experts. However, for long-term bets, HDFC Bank may gain favour, once there's more clarity on its post-merger growth trajectory and how it stacks up against ICICI Bank.","ICICI Bank's superior near-term earnings visibility makes it more attractive to short-term investors.

Silicon shuttle: Is Jensen Huang the new Tim Cook for US-China relations?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/silicon-shuttle-is-jensen-huang-the-new-tim-cook-for-us-china-relations/articleshow/122839539.cms,"TL;DR: Driving the news

The Nvidia CEO secured US approval to resume sales of H20 AI chips to China, reversing a previous ban and safeguarding billions in revenue.

Huang has become a rare and effective intermediary between Washington and Beijing, using shuttle diplomacy to keep Nvidia in both markets.

The US chose to allow sales of less advanced chips to keep Chinese firms dependent on American technology, rather than ceding the market to Huawei.

Nvidia’s global importance has soared, with its chips powering AI worldwide and the company now valued at over $4 trillion.

“I don’t think I changed [Trump’s] mind,” Huang said. “It’s my job to inform the president about what I know very well, which is the technology industry, artificial intelligence, the developments of AI around the world”.

Why it matters

The big picture

Nvidia, now the world’s most valuable company at over $4 trillion, is at the heart of a new great power race: AI dominance.

Strategic leverage: Its chips fuel generative AI systems worldwide - including those built by Chinese firms that Washington fears could be repurposed for military uses.

Tightrope walk: The US wants to stay ahead technologically by curbing China’s access to the most advanced semiconductors. But it also doesn’t want to push China into full self-reliance - or let Huawei monopolize the world’s largest tech market.

Enter Huang: Unlike Apple, Nvidia’s business isn’t deeply embedded in Chinese supply chains. That gives Huang unusual room to maneuver - and to push back.

What they’re saying

“He’s a skillful CEO who… must navigate the China and non-China technology ecosystems,” Kurt Tong, former US consul general in Hong Kong and a partner at the Asia Group, told Bloomberg

“He makes the same argument, even where it is unpopular,” Brad Gerstner, CEO of Altimeter Capital and major Nvidia investor, told the NYT. “Because he believes… that winning developer mind-share in China and depriving Huawei of a monopoly market is the best way for American AI to win.""

“Technology leadership requires big markets,” Huang told reporters in Beijing, noting that China has “half the world’s AI researchers”

A reluctant player in a high-stakes game

Huang’s challenge is unlike any faced by his Silicon Valley peers. Apple’s Tim Cook rode a decade-long boom by embedding Apple deep into China’s supply chain and retail markets. Elon Musk, once treated like a rock star by Beijing, has faded from favor amid his public feuding with Trump and Tesla’s slipping China performance.

Huang’s approach? Strategic ambiguity. Maintain good standing with both Washington and Beijing. Say little. Smile often. Speak Mandarin when needed. Shake the right hands.

Zoom in: The Cook comparison

Like Cook during the Trump and Biden years, Huang is operating in a space where national security, trade, and technology policy blur.

Cook’s era: Apple’s China strategy delivered stunning financial results. Between 2012–2022, its profits in Greater China more than tripled.

But by 2023: iPhones were banned in Chinese government offices, Huawei roared back, and Cook’s access seemed to fade.

Now: Apple remains deeply reliant on Chinese suppliers - 4 of its top 20 - while Nvidia’s top 20 suppliers include none from China.

The Economist notes: “Mr. Huang is not Mr Cook. He may lack the Alabamian’s disarming lilt, but he seems more fluent both in MAGA and in Xi Jinping Thought.”

His statements - both in the US and China - are tailored for maximum compatibility:

To Trump: “Manufacturing in the United States wouldn’t have accelerated to this pace without the president’s strong encouragement.”

To Beijing: “AI research and development must be global, collaborative, and inclusive.”

What’s next

Just days after shaking hands with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, Jensen Huang was on stage in Beijing in his signature leather jacket, grinning as he greeted a Chinese audience in fluent Mandarin. On cue from a former Chinese commerce official, he struck an upbeat tone about shared futures and AI breakthroughs. Applause followed.What he didn’t say - but what everyone watching understood - was that Nvidia, the company he co-founded and now leads as CEO, had just pulled off a high-stakes diplomatic and commercial coup.The Trump administration, in an abrupt reversal, had approved the sale of Nvidia’s H20 chip to China, rescinding a ban that had threatened billions in revenue.Huang is fast emerging as a reluctant - and remarkably effective - emissary between Washington and Beijing. His cross-Pacific shuttle diplomacy has not only preserved Nvidia’s access to a $17 billion Chinese market, but it’s also made him the closest figure in today’s tech world to Tim Cook’s once-coveted role as corporate bridge between the world’s two superpowers.But this role comes with exponentially higher stakes.The H20 chip is less powerful than Nvidia’s flagship models, but still valuable to Chinese AI firms desperate for access to cutting-edge silicon. When the Trump administration quietly blocked its export this spring, it was a gut punch: Nvidia stood to lose $5.5 billion in potential sales. Huang, normally averse to political trench warfare, sprang into action.He testified before Congress, courted White House officials, and met directly with Trump. According to the New York Times, he argued that banning Nvidia’s chip would hand the market to Huawei and other Chinese rivals - undercutting US leadership in AI.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick later echoed that logic publicly, saying the administration wanted Chinese developers “addicted to American technology,” even if that meant letting them buy older chips. It was a stunning reversal, and one that underscored Huang’s emerging role not just as a CEO, but as a geopolitical actor.“Huang is obviously on good terms with Trump administration. Yet his chip business is one of the biggest flashpoints between Beijing and Washington,” Feng Chucheng, a founding partner at Hutong Research, told Bloomberg.Huang, 62, didn’t seek out this role. He has long described himself as an engineer, not a politician. In January, while most of Silicon Valley's elite gathered in Washington for Trump’s inauguration, Huang was thousands of miles away, touring Nvidia’s Asia operations. That posture - politically agnostic, business-first - worked until his company’s chips became central to the US-China tech rivalry.Now, navigating that rivalry is part of his job. Nvidia, which controls more than 90% of the market for advanced AI chips, has become a critical player not just in the global tech economy, but in national security calculus on both sides of the Pacific.“He’s obviously on good terms with the Trump administration,” Feng Chucheng, founding partner of Hutong Research, told Bloomberg. “Yet his chip business is one of the biggest flashpoints between Beijing and Washington. It’s possible the two leaders may want such a channel for messaging, but is he willing to?”So far, Huang’s actions suggest he’s willing - up to a point.A Trump-Xi summit is widely expected later this year. Behind the scenes, the two sides are weighing broader trade-offs: easing chip controls, expanding rare earth supplies, and potentially extending US-China tech cooperation.The US commerce separtment’s move to reapprove Nvidia’s H20 chip sales came just as China agreed to supply rare earth magnets to American firms. Trump officials described the maneuver as a way to get Beijing “addicted to the American technology stack” while keeping US firms in control.Whether intentional or not, Huang helped deliver the talking points - and the outcome.“We can only influence them, inform them, do our best to provide them with facts,” Huang said modestly. “And then beyond that is out of our control”.(With inputs from agencies)","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has secured US approval to resume sales of H20 AI chips to China, reversing a previous ban.

General Motors reported a 35% year-on-year decline in second-quarter profit but managed to surpass Wall Street expectations and held firm on its full-year outlook that had been revised downward in May due to tariff-related headwinds.For the quarter ended June 30, GM posted a net profit of $1.89 billion, or $1.91 per share, compared to $2.93 billion, or $2.55 per share, in the same period last year. Stripping out certain items, adjusted earnings stood at $2.53 per share, comfortably beating analyst estimates of $2.34, according to FactSet.Revenue also slipped marginally to $47.12 billion from $47.97 billion, but still came in higher than Wall Street’s forecast of $45.84 billion. GM shares were down over 3% in premarket trade on Tuesday, AP reported.CEO Mary Barra, in a letter to shareholders, acknowledged the company’s tariff challenges, noting a $1.1 billion net impact from tariffs in the second quarter. She warned that the third quarter could see a higher impact, citing indirect costs related to trade policy. GM expects total gross tariff exposure of $4 billion to $5 billion in 2025.“Today’s announcement underpins our belief in America’s innovation in biopharmaceuticals,” Barra wrote, adding, “We are positioning the business for a profitable, long-term future as we adapt to new trade and tax policies, and a rapidly evolving tech landscape.”To mitigate the pressure, GM said it is making progress in offsetting at least 30% of its gross tariff exposure through targeted cost initiatives, manufacturing adjustments, and strategic pricing. The automaker had previously announced a $4 billion investment to shift production from Mexico to US plants—its largest domestic manufacturing commitment in recent years.Barra said the move was aimed at “greatly reducing our tariff exposure,” and that the company continues to leverage its domestic battery investments and flexible manufacturing footprint to maintain profitability.GM also reported electric vehicle (EV) sales of 46,300 units in Q2, up from 31,900 in Q1, even as overall EV market growth in the US shows signs of slowing. The $7,500 EV tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act is set to expire for many models in September.“Despite slower EV industry growth, we believe the long-term future is profitable electric vehicle production, and this continues to be our north star,” Barra said, reaffirming GM’s EV strategy.GM maintained its full-year earnings forecast of adjusted EBIT between $10 billion and $12.5 billion, a guidance range lowered in May in anticipation of steep tariff impacts.The broader auto sector has been under strain due to President Donald Trump’s trade policies, which initially imposed 25% tariffs on auto imports. While Trump relaxed some of these duties in April, his administration has ordered a review into further levies on foreign-made vehicles and parts.According to the Center for Automotive Research, a uniform 25% tariff across all trading partners could cost the US auto industry an additional $107.7 billion, with Detroit’s Big Three automakers—GM, Ford and Stellantis—bearing $41.9 billion of that burden.The report came a day after Stellantis said it expects to post a €2.3 billion ($2.68 billion) net loss in H1 due to tariffs and other charges.

"‘Pain in the a**’: Bryan Johnson may shut down his anti-ageing startup Blueprint, says philosophy matters more than profit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pain-in-the-a-bryan-johnson-may-shut-down-his-anti-ageing-startup-blueprint-says-philosophy-matters-more-than-profit/articleshow/122837090.cms,"File photo: US tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson

US tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson , known for his $2 million-a-year quest to reverse ageing, is now considering shutting down or selling his biotech company Blueprint, calling it a burden he no longer wants to carry.“Honestly, I am so close to either shutting it down or selling it,” Johnson said in an interview with American magazine Wired published Monday, adding, “I don’t need the money, and it’s a pain-in-the-a** company.”Blueprint, Johnson’s anti-ageing startup, markets itself as a system for longevity, offering supplements, biometric tests, and plant-based nutrition products like a $55 “longevity mix” and $42 mushroom coffee alternative called “Super Shrooms.”But despite the company’s bold pitch, Johnson now says the commercial venture is interfering with his broader ideological mission.Johnson believes running a health-focused company has undermined his credibility in advocating for what he sees as a deeper philosophical movement.“The problem is now people see the business and give me less credibility on the philosophy side,” he said in the interview. “I will not make that trade-off.It is not worth it to me. So yeah, I don’t want it”, he added.The 47-year-old launched Project Blueprint in 2021, an intensive anti-ageing regimen that includes dozens of daily supplements, strict calorie tracking, and sleep monitoring. At one point, Johnson transfused blood plasma from his teenage son, though he later stopped the practice, saying there were “no benefits detected.”Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that Blueprint was missing its monthly break-even point by at least $1 million, citing internal documents and interviews with staff.Johnson did not address the financial specifics in response to the Times, but said the report was inaccurate. “They painted it like we are in some kind of emergency financial situation. That is not the case,” he said. “We are break-even... We’ve had profitable months, we’ve had loss months.”Johnson also pushed back on criticisms of Blueprint’s use of confidentiality agreements. Multiple former employees, including a former fiancée, filed complaints with the National Labour Relations Board alleging overly restrictive NDAs.Johnson acknowledged the complaints but framed them in the context of his personal experiences with wealth. “When I made that money, I did not understand what it means to have money and how it fundamentally changes your relationship with the entire world,” he said.Aside from Blueprint, Johnson has turned his focus to a new project, launching a religion. In March, he announced the formation of “Don’t Die,” a movement aimed at redefining humanity’s existential priorities in an age of AI.As per Wired, the religion is rooted in a belief that the highest virtue is existence itself.“I’m not arguing for immortality. I’m not arguing for utopia,” he said. “We as a species, our existence is at risk... The single thing we have in common is that nobody wants to die right now. That’s it.”Johnson believes his message is incompatible with running a commercial venture. “Companies come and go. Religions have endured for millennia,” he said, adding that Blueprint started simply because friends asked for the supplements he was taking.Now, he says he’s ready to walk away.","US tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson is now considering shutting down or selling his biotech company Blueprint, calling it a burden he no longer wants to carry.

Big decisions on card



Investor confidence fuels tech IPOs



Potential challenges



Cloud-based design platform Figma is aiming for a valuation of up to $16.4 billion in its upcoming initial public offering (IPO) for its debut at New York Stock Exchange.The San Francisco-headquartered firm, along with existing investors, plans to raise as much as $1.03 billion by offering nearly 37 million shares, priced in the range of $25 to $28 each. The listing is expected to add momentum to a gradually reviving market for tech IPOs, reported news agency Reuters.The upcoming listing could mark complete contrast for Figma, coming over a year after its proposed $20 billion acquisition by Adobe collapsed due to regulatory roadblocks in the UK and Europe.Figma is a cloud-based design platform that enables users to collaborate - create and edit apps, websites, and software interfaces. Its client base includes major companies such as ServiceNow, Workday, and SAP.The company reported a 46% increase in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, while net income tripled over the same period, reported Reuters.Figma has indicated a willingness to pursue bold acquisitions, with co-founder and CEO Dylan Field stating the company is ready to ""make decisions that may not seem immediately rational.""A strong equities rally and a wave of successful tech IPOs have helped lift investor sentiment, clearing the overhang in the market.Figma’s debut is expected shortly after the blockbuster listing of stablecoin issuer Circle, which surged on debut and has continued its upward run.Figma plans to debut on the stock market under the symbol “FIG.” Leading investment banks including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Allen & Co, and JP Morgan are serving as underwriters for the offering, according to Reuters.Last year during a tender offer the company was valued at $12.5 billion that enabled employees and early investors to sell a portion of their shares.The design software firm has also garnered attention for its crypto exposure. As per its filing, Figma held around $70 million in Bitwise’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund as of March 31 and plans to invest an additional $30 million in the digital asset.However, the IPO comes amid a shifting industry landscape. While Figma is increasing its focus on AI, it has also cautioned that AI-powered design tools could reduce customer dependence on its platform.The company also flagged potential challenges in talent acquisition due to restrictive immigration policies. It pointed out that it has previously adjusted hiring strategies in response to visa framework changes.With the majority of its last fiscal revenue coming from international markets, the company remains vulnerable to potential demand slowdowns if global clients cut back on spending due to tariffs.Renewed trade tensions may heighten caution among IPO investors, potentially causing further market disruptions.In this environment, investor focus is firmly on companies with strong fundamentals and a clear route to profitability, said Leslie Marlow, corporate attorney at Blank Rome.","Figma is a cloud-based design platform that enables users to collaborate - create and edit apps, websites, and software interfaces.

Donald Trump tariff impact: Jeep parent company Stellantis sees $2.7 billion loss; revenue dips 12.6%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tariff-stellantis-first-half-revenue-falls-12-6-sales-in-north-america-continues-to-slump/articleshow/122830819.cms,"Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep, reported a substantial 2.3-billion-euro ($2.7-billion) net loss in the initial half of the year, affected by new US tariffs and significant charges due to US legislative changes.North American sales continued to decline, with a 25 percent volume reduction in the second quarter compared to the previous year, AP repoted.The automotive group, which includes brands such as Peugeot, Citroen and Fiat, recorded a 12.6 percent decrease in first-half net revenues to 74.3 billion euros, based on preliminary and unaudited results.Vehicle sales declined by six percent in the second quarter year-on-year, following a nine percent reduction in the first quarter of 2025.The company cited a 300-million-euro negative impact from ""the early effects of US tariffs"", which disrupted their North American recovery strategy, as per AP.Car manufacturers have found it challenging to adapt to the new 25 percent US tariff on imported vehicles not predominantly manufactured within North America.The organisation, which includes Chrysler, Dodge and Ram Truck brands, temporarily stopped production at certain Canadian and Mexican facilities in April when the tariffs became effective.The company attributed the significant decline in North American sales volume to reduced production and delivery of imported vehicles affected by tariffs, alongside decreased corporate fleet sales.Stellantis recorded a 3.3-billion-euro charge, primarily related to programme cancellation costs, platform impairments, CAFE penalty rate legislation impact, and restructuring.Recent legislation approved by US President Donald Trump eliminated penalties for non-compliance with CAFE fuel economy targets, allowing manufacturers to produce more high-emission vehicles in the United States.The company indicated it had begun implementing measures to enhance performance and profitability, anticipating new products to have greater impact in the latter half of 2025.Stellantis shares experienced volatility on Monday, initially dropping over two percent before recovering to rise by more than two percent.Chief financial officer Doug Ostermann explained that approximately two billion euros of the charge related to eliminating unprofitable product programmes.These charges included European redundancy costs, abandonment of a 700-million-euro hydrogen fuel cell development programme, and European vehicle recalls due to defective Takata airbags.The company withdrew its financial guidance in April due to uncertainties created by US tariffs.Ostermann highlighted the current climate of economic and regulatory uncertainty.Financial analysts at ODDO BHF noted that sales decreases were anticipated, and new chief executives often implement provisions or restructuring charges upon assuming leadership.Antonio Filosa, appointed chief executive in June, promptly initiated management changes. He previously led and maintains responsibility for the North American region, which generates most company profits and whose difficulties led to Carlos Tavares's dismissal.While the overall six-percent sales volume reduction aligned with analyst expectations, the 25-percent decline was significantly higher than the predicted 12 percent.The company confirmed its audited first-half results would be released on July 29 as planned.","Stellantis recorded a 2.3-billion-euro ($2.7-billion) net loss in the initial half of the year.

Allies under pressure as US sticks to its terms

Russia tariffs tied to political goals

China discussions may restart, focus on overcapacity and oil

The US will not fast-track trade deals simply to meet deadlines, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said, signalling that the Trump administration remains focused on securing high-quality agreements even as a key tariff deadline approaches.In an interview with CNBC, Bessent stated, “The Trump administration is more concerned with the quality of trade agreements rather than their timing. We're not going to rush for the sake of doing deals.” The remarks come ahead of the August 1 deadline, when tariffs on several US trade partners could kick in if talks fail to yield progress, according to an ET report.While describing the ongoing negotiations as “moving along,” Bessent warned that failure to reach agreements could escalate trade tensions. “If we boomerang on August 1 tariffs, higher tariffs could put more pressure on countries,” he said.Bessent pointed to growing engagement from the European Union, noting, “They’ve become more engaged,” and said he expects Brussels may aim to speed up negotiations. “I imagine they would want to negotiate faster,” he added.On Japan, Bessent clarified that Washington’s focus remains firmly on securing the best outcomes for the US, not adapting to domestic political calendars in partner countries.“Our priorities are not internal government but best deals for U.S.,” he said.Despite the approaching deadline, Bessent expressed confidence in the ongoing discussions. “Trade is in a good place,” he said.Touching on Russia, Bessent acknowledged that tariff measures can go beyond trade. “Tariffs can be a means to political ends,” he said, referring to current conversations around sanctions.He also hinted at a possible joint strategy with allies, saying, “Would urge Europe to follow us if we implement secondary tariffs,” without naming affected sectors or timelines.On China, Bessent said talks could resume “in the near future,” but flagged overcapacity as the primary concern. “The elephant in the room with China is overcapacity,” he said, mentioning steel and solar as key pressure points.He also pointed to two new areas of concern that may enter future negotiations—Beijing’s trade ties with Russia and its stance on Iranian oil. “Could start talking about Iranian oil,” Bessent said, while adding that the US “could discuss [China’s] trade with Russia” as part of broader diplomatic talks.","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says the US will not fast-track trade deals simply to meet deadlines.

"Forget Nvidia’s $4 trillion valuation! This tech company is set to cross $4.5 trillion market cap, thanks to its big AI bets",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/forget-nvidias-4-trillion-valuation-this-tech-company-is-set-to-cross-4-5-trillion-market-cap-thanks-to-its-big-ai-bets/articleshow/122818873.cms,"Nvidia has become the first company to cross the $4 trillion. But, there’s another technology company that may hit $4.5 trillion! (AI image)

Nvidia’s Rise: Is The Market Dominance Sustainable?

Which Company can Hit $4.5 Trillion Market Cap?

Oppenheimer's optimistic outlook comes from many factors:

There is expectation of higher revenue growth from Microsoft's Azure cloud computing service.

Azure has actually emerged as Microsoft's main growth driver. This is due to increasing computational requirements for AI development.

Additionally, Microsoft's investment in OpenAI not only implies a significant Azure customer but also provides essential resources for the broader AI development community.

Nvidia has seen a meteoric rise - becoming the first company in the world to have a market capitalization of over $4 trillion. In fact there are only five economies in the world that have a GDP of over $4 trillion as per IMF’s 2025 projections. But even though Nvidia has become the first company to cross the $4 trillion capitalization mark, there’s another technology company that may hit $4.5 trillion!According to Oppenheimer analysts quoted in a Motley Fool report, another AI giant is poised to join Nvidia in the $4 trillion valuation category and potentially reach $4.5 trillion within the next year. Currently, this particular stock presents a more favourable investment opportunity compared to Nvidia, the Oppenheimer analysts believeNvidia stands out as a big success story - its valuation has seen an over 10 times rise in the last three years. This remarkable growth stems from substantial investments in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, where Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) serve as essential components.However, Nvidia's leading position in the AI chip sector encounters challenges.Other GPU manufacturers are improving their price-performance ratios, whilst Nvidia's major hyperscale clients are increasingly utilising their own custom silicon designs for generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications.This could possibly impact the company’s growth outlook.Nvidia is an AI chip industry leader, particularly in training hardware. Its superiority comes from advanced tech capabilities and its exclusive CUDA software platform. This creates big barriers for competitors to surmount in the semiconductor market, the Motley Fool report says.However, major clients such as Meta Platforms and Microsoft are actively seeking to reduce their dependence on Nvidia's AI training hardware, the report said.Meta is expanding its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator system across various generative AI applications. Their new chip aims to replace Nvidia processors in AI training for the Llama foundation model, whilst they already utilise their custom chips for certain AI inference operations.Microsoft harbors similar objectives with its Maia chips, although they have delayed their next-generation AI training chip launch to 2026, rather than releasing it this year.Such delays have previously affected other large-scale computing companies, including Meta, resulting in substantial Nvidia orders.Nevertheless, as these technology giants enhance their chip design capabilities, they could potentially reduce their reliance on Nvidia's processors substantially over time.Nvidia maintains a strong market position, particularly following the US government's decision to lift restrictions on H20 chip sales in China. The company is poised to see a robust earnings growth throughout the year, driven by Chinese market access and hyperscaler demand.However, what is noteworthy is that Nvidia’s shares command a significant premium, trading at nearly 40 times projected earnings, the report noted. Given this elevated valuation and potential long-term challenges, the stock's growth rate might lag behind other major artificial intelligence enterprises.Currently, only a select few organisations rival Nvidia's market presence. Among the exclusive group of companies valued above $1 trillion, merely three have achieved valuations exceeding $3 trillion, with Nvidia being one of them.Microsoft, valued at approximately $3.8 trillion presently, stands closest to Nvidia. Oppenheimer analysts project Microsoft could reach the $4 trillion milestone shortly. Their analysis sets a $600 price target for Microsoft shares, suggesting a potential market valuation of $4.5 trillion, representing a 19% increase from its value as of July 15.The surge in demand has been remarkable. Despite Microsoft's substantial investment of $80 billion in capital expenditures, primarily directed towards data centre construction and equipment, the company reports that demand still exceeds supply. Nevertheless, Azure maintains its position as the fastest-growing platform amongst the three major public cloud services.Analysts' optimistic outlook on Microsoft stems largely from the prospects of Copilot Studio. Whilst they acknowledge modest interest in Microsoft 365's native AI assistant Copilot, they anticipate stronger performance from the customisable AI assistant platform, Copilot Studio. This development allows Microsoft to implement higher pricing for its enterprise software package whilst maintaining customer loyalty. The higher revenue can in turn be reinvested in Azure and share buyback programmes. This would potentially boost earnings per share via improved profits distributed across a lower share count.Microsoft shares currently trade at approximately 33 times forward earnings, reflecting a relatively high valuation. However, this multiple appears justified for a company that maintains leadership positions in both cloud computing and enterprise software sectors of the AI industry.Following news about potential reversal of US restrictions on chip exports to China, Oppenheimer analysts revised their Nvidia price target to $200 per share, suggesting a market capitalisation of $4.9 trillion. However, at current prices, Microsoft presents a more appealing investment opportunity, the report said.","N Nvidia has seen a meteoric rise - becoming the first company in the world to have a market capitalization of over $4 trillion.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 52 points, or 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4% to a new all-time high, AP reported.Telecom giant Verizon Communications led the gains with a 3% jump after posting quarterly earnings and revenue ahead of analysts’ expectations. The company also raised its full-year profit and financial forecasts.That helped balance a 0.4% decline in Microsoft shares, which slipped after the company issued an emergency software patch to fix a critical SharePoint vulnerability that had been actively exploited by hackers, including against some federal agencies.Block Inc, formerly Square and founded by Jack Dorsey, surged 6.7% after being announced as the newest entrant to the S&P 500 index. It will replace Hess Corp, which was acquired by Chevron, and begin trading in the index on Wednesday.Steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs rallied 6.8% after reporting a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss. The company shipped a record 4.3 million net tons of steel in the spring quarter. CEO Lourenco Goncalves credited Trump-era tariffs for boosting domestic manufacturing, calling them a ""positive impact"" on the business. Cleveland-Cliffs is a major supplier to the auto sector, which benefits from domestic sourcing policies.However, the broader market remains cautious. While tariffs may aid certain sectors, they are also pushing up import costs. Companies like General Motors, which reports results later this week, are grappling with the downside. Other key earnings due include Alphabet, Coca-Cola, and Tesla.Many of Trump’s proposed tariffs remain on hold, with the next major deadline set for August 1 as negotiations with trading partners continue.Despite the mixed backdrop, early signs from the earnings season suggest resilience. Most companies have been beating Wall Street estimates, with Bank of America’s Savita Subramanian noting potential “encouraging undertones” from strong retail sales and rising travel demand, as reported by United Airlines.In the bond market, yields dipped. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.38% from 4.44% on Friday.Global cues were mixed. European indices edged lower after modest gains in Asian markets. Japan’s markets were shut for a public holiday, following a political upset in Sunday’s upper house elections.Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its coalition majority in both houses of parliament for the first time since 1955. Ishiba, facing voter anger over inflation and instability, pledged to remain in office. Analysts expect his government to ramp up spending, adding to Japan’s already high debt levels.","The S&P 500 rose 0.3% in early trade, hovering just above the record it set last Thursday.

This marked Huang’s third visit to China in 2025 and coincided with the reopening of H20 chip sales in the country following a US-imposed ban in April.The head of the world’s most valuable company arrived in China last week to attend the China International Supply Chain Expo, just days after meeting US President Donald Trump. Huang's presence in Beijing came amid growing geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions between Washington and Beijing, with Nvidia’s $17 billion China business caught in the middle of an intensifying technology rivalry, Reuters reported.""Jensen Huang's visit aimed to demonstrate Nvidia's commitment to the Chinese market,"" said Lian Jye Su, chief analyst at Omdia. ""However, this commitment must be balanced against potential US government concerns about deepening ties with China.""In Beijing, Huang praised Chinese AI models developed by DeepSeek, Alibaba, and Tencent as “world class”, and said demand for Nvidia’s H20 chips had surged since the launch of DeepSeek models in January.He also held meetings with senior Chinese officials, including Vice Premier and trade tsar He Lifeng and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, which he described as “wonderful”.""Nvidia will still need to see the tide clearly and ride it at the right time to maximize the available benefits. But good for the company, I think it has a CEO who's very good at doing that,"" said Tilly Zhang, a technology analyst with Gavekal Dragonomics, quoted Reuters.Despite the warm reception, some analysts say Nvidia’s dominance in China could face long-term challenges. ""The Chinese government will actively help or subsidize domestic rivals that can one day stand up to and, at least in some use cases, replace high-end Nvidia chips,"" said Charlie Chai, an analyst with 86Research.When asked how US officials reacted to his China trip, Huang told reporters, “I told President Trump and his cabinet that I was coming to China. Told him about my trip here, and he said, 'Have a great trip'.""At the Expo, Huang wore a traditional black Chinese-style jacket instead of his trademark leather one and referred to himself as ""Chinese"" during his speech. He lauded the scale of China’s supply chain as “vast” and praised even strategic rival Huawei Technologies.""I think the fact of the matter is, anyone who discounts Huawei and anyone who discounts China's manufacturing capability is deeply naive.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

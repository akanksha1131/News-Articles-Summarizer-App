Tata Capital IPO: Why has GMP crashed?

Tata Capital: Long-Term Outlook

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Capital IPO: The initial public offering of Tata Group ’s flagship financial services arm Tata Capital got a big thumbsup from brkokerages, with several positive reviews. Yet, the Grey Market Premium (GMP) has crashed to just 3%. The GMP is usually seen as an indicator of the expected listing gains.Tata Capital stands amongst India's prominent non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). The IPO offers shares at Rs 310 to Rs 326, comprising a fresh issue of Rs 6,846 crore alongside an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 8,666 crore by Tata Sons, the promoter. The subscription period concludes on October 8, with the anticipated listing on October 13.The company's robust fundamentals, varied business portfolio, and reliable parent organisation have garnered widespread appreciation from analysts, according to an ET report.Brokerages including Canara Bank Securities, Anand Rathi, BP Wealth, and Mehta Equities have endorsed it as a worthwhile long-term investment. They highlight Tata Capital's established retail and SME operations, sound asset management, and digital lending initiatives as advantageous factors in India's expanding credit sector.The conservative GMP indicates investor wariness regarding immediate returns.Market specialists point out three fundamental factors contributing to this restrained sentiment, the ET report said.Initially, the offering's valuation structure provides minimal scope for immediate appreciation. With a post-issue book value multiple of 4.2 to 4.3 times at the higher price range, Tata Capital's valuation aligns with industry counterparts such as Bajaj Finance and HDB Financial. Industry watchers note that positive aspects, including robust financial health and consistent earnings, are already reflected in the pricing.Arihant Capital Markets' Chief Strategy Officer, Shruti Jain, attributes the modest grey market premium to appropriate pricing.""At 4.2–4.3x post-money, the IPO valuations don't leave much on the table for listing gains. While the fundamentals are strong, the current market is cautious, with several growth companies facing valuation pressures. That's why the GMP hasn't picked up despite Tata Capital's sound business model,"" she explained.Additionally, the recent consolidation with Tata Motor Finance Ltd. (TMFL) has generated uncertainties regarding portfolio quality and earnings potential.Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza, pointed out that despite the merger enhancing Tata Capital's vehicle finance operations, it has temporarily elevated its gross non-performing assets (NPA) to approximately 1% from 0.5%.""The merger led to a short-term rise in NPAs and reduced the return on equity (ROE) to 12.6% in FY25 from 14.2% in FY24,"" he said.The IPO landscape has become considerably congested. The simultaneous occurrence of major issues alongside competition from LG Electronics has stretched investor funds. This situation has constrained speculative activities in the grey market, which operates based on short-term trading sentiment.According to Prashanth Tapse, Senior Vice President at Mehta Equities, investors must now be more discriminating. ""In the current IPO frenzy, where investor capital is limited, careful selection becomes crucial to maximize return. While Tata Capital's IPO has attracted attention, other high-growth offerings like LG Electronics may be drawing part of the focus,"" he said.Analysts widely agree that Tata Capital offers steady growth potential over the long run. The company plans to utilise fresh capital from its public offering to strengthen its Tier-I position, enabling expansion of its lending operations. The organisation's balanced lending portfolio, spread across consumer, small business and corporate sectors, stands to gain from India's robust credit requirements in the coming years.Whilst current unofficial market sentiment appears subdued, Tata Capital's core business metrics and established brand value position it as a stable investment avenue for extended periods rather than immediate listing gains, the ET report said.","Tata Capital stands amongst India's prominent non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) The IPO offers shares at Rs 310 to Rs 326, comprising a fresh issue of Rs 6,846 crore alongside an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 8,666 crore.

Pool of credit-worthy Indians needs to expand: Niti Aayog chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pool-of-credit-worthy-indians-needs-to-expand-niti-aayog-chief/articleshow/124376009.cms,"



MUMBAI: The pool of credit-worthy individuals in India remains small and needs to expand, BVR Subrahmanyam, CEO of Niti Aayog , said at the Global Fintech Fest (GFF) 2025, highlighting the role of technology and fintech in meeting the country’s finance needs.Speaking to Kunal Shah, founder of Cred, Subrahmanyam said India, now the world’s fourth-largest economy, aims to become a developed country by 2047 with a per capita GDP of $18,000 and a total GDP of $30 trillion—surpassing the United States. “These goals are set because India has largely resolved the problems of the past: hunger, poverty, illiteracy, and disease,” he said.“Finance is the oil that greases the wheels. Without it, nothing moves. Technology can help create new types of organizations to manage financial functions, and fintech is central to this transformation.”On credit inclusion, he noted that traditional lending relied heavily on collateral, but digitalization now allows financial behavior and cash flows to guide credit decisions. “India’s credit needs are immense—trillions of dollars for a $30 trillion economy. Large gaps remain for women, MSMEs, and youth.Fintech can use alternative data to expand credit, even in smaller doses initially,” he said, citing schemes like Mudra and PM Vishwakarma that enhance loans based on repayment history.Subrahmanyam also stressed women’s labor force participation as a driver of growth. “Women’s participation has risen 8–10% over the last decade but remains too low. Increasing it by 10% can add 1.5% to GDP growth,” he said. He highlighted flexible work, safety, mentorship, and access to credit as key enablers, noting that tech-enabled finance can provide low-cost credit to underserved groups, building on the self-help group movement.Subrahmanyam outlined the success of India’s digital ecosystem, anchored in the JAM trinity—Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and mobile—which has enabled 500 million Jan Dhan accounts, 1.3 billion Aadhaar numbers, and over 20 billion UPI transactions annually. Innovations such as the account aggregator framework have strengthened fintech at scale, giving India a chance to meet domestic credit needs while emerging as a global fintech leader.On artificial intelligence, Subrahmanyam described it as a transformative disruptor capable of re-engineering processes such as credit assessment, risk management, and fraud detection. “AI can improve tasks, transform processes, and, in some cases, eliminate the need for certain processes entirely. India has the scale, technology, and digital base to innovate rapidly,” he said. Regulators will need sandboxes and activity-based regulation to support experimentation while maintaining safety.Subrahmanyam acknowledged that fintech investment has evolved. “Innovation ecosystems develop over time. Early funding benefited from global low-interest rates, but opportunities remain for good ideas. Fintech 1.0 enhanced traditional finance; Fintech 2.0 will integrate AI and expand to untapped markets,” he said, emphasizing that India’s market is still largely underserved.Looking ahead, he envisioned a comprehensive fintech 2.0 platform by 2047, serving all individual needs—transactions, payments, savings, investments, insurance, and pensions—with products tailored for women, youth, MSMEs, and remote populations. AI will enable highly customized solutions, while state-level innovation hubs and sandboxes will accelerate development. “India will set global standards, and by leveraging technology wisely, we can achieve Viksit Bharat and become a global leader in fintech,” he said.","BVR Subrahmanyam, CEO of Niti Aayog, spoke at the Global Fintech Fest (GFF) 2025. He said India aims to become a developed country by 2047 with a per capita GDP of $18,000. “Finance is the oil that greases the wheels.

Now UPI can be authorised with device biometric scanner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/now-upi-can-be-authorised-with-device-biometric-scanner/articleshow/124375991.cms,".





MUMBAI: Department of Financial Services secretary M Nagaraju announced three new digital payment features at the Global Fintech Fest 2025 in Mumbai to make payments simpler and more accessible. The launches include on-device biometric authentication for UPI transactions, Aadhaar-based face authentication for setting or resetting UPI PINs, and cash withdrawal through micro ATMs using UPI at business correspondent touchpoints.The on-device biometric option allows users to authorise payments using their smartphone’s fingerprint or face unlock instead of a UPI PIN. The facility is optional and verified by issuing banks through cryptographic checks to ensure secure and faster transactions.Aadhaar-based face authentication enables users to set or reset their UPI PINs using facial verification through UIDAI’s FaceRD app, removing the need for debit card details or OTPs. The feature aims to simplify onboarding for first-time users and senior citizens and will later be extended for transaction authentication.The cash withdrawal feature allows users to withdraw money at UPI Cash Points by scanning a dynamic QR code and authorising the transaction through their UPI app.It complements Aadhaar-enabled and card-based withdrawals, improving access to cash in underserved regions and furthering the goal of financial inclusion.Highlighting the challenge of deepening digital payments in rural and tribal areas, Nagaraju said, “One challenge we still face, even with the substantial growth of UPI , is bringing communities in tribal and rural areas into the formal financial system.Many of these areas also struggle with limited internet connectivity, which makes offline transactions a challenge. However, several fintechs are now innovating to connect rural communities and develop offline payment solutions. Once these efforts take hold, the entire country can be part of the formal financial system and benefit from digital payments.”","Department of Financial Services secretary M Nagaraju announced three new digital payment features at the Global Fintech Fest 2025 in Mumbai.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Mumbai on Wednesday for his first visit to India as PM. A major focus of the trip is the Scotch whisky industry, seen as a “big winner” of the India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which the UK government expects will boost the Scottish economy by 190 million pounds a year.India and the UK signed the FTA in July during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to London. The deal cuts tariffs on goods from textiles to whisky and cars and opens up more market access for businesses.Downing Street said members of the Scotch Whisky Association and producers are joining Starmer’s trade mission to explore potential whisky sales to India worth 1 billion pounds a year, creating more than 1,000 new UK jobs.Representatives from Diageo and the Scotch Whisky Association are also part of the trip. The India-UK deal will cut tariffs for UK whisky firms from 150% to 75%, eventually reducing them to 40% over the next decade.The industry has been pushing the UK government to reduce US tariffs after a deal with the US did not include whisky.In India, Scotch whisky is very popular. Many consumers spend on premium brands, and India is among the top markets in the world for Scotch. Famous names like Johnnie Walker, Chivas Regal, Buchanan’s, and Glenfiddich are already well-known among Indian whisky lovers.According to Reuters, talks on the trade pact were concluded in May after three years of stop-start negotiations. Both countries accelerated efforts amid tariff issues caused by US President Donald Trump.The deal between India and United Kingdom aims to increase bilateral trade by 25.5 billion pounds ($34 billion) by 2040.Officials said Starmer’s visit will include meetings with senior ministers in PM Modi’s cabinet and business leaders to deepen trade and diplomatic ties, benefiting the whole UK.","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Mumbai on Wednesday for his first visit to India as PM.

MUMBAI: RBI has come out with a draft Ombudsman Scheme 2025, which proposes giving the RBI ombudsman broad powers to resolve customer grievances, removing limits on the financial value of disputes and introducing high ceilings for compensation. The move is aimed at providing a cost-effective, non-adversarial mechanism to handle complaints against regulated entities.Under the draft, the ombudsman can handle complaints related to any deficiency in service by regulated entities without any cap on the amount in dispute.However, compensation limits are set: up to Rs 30 lakh for consequential loss and up to Rs 3 lakh for harassment, time lost, or mental anguish.The draft scheme signals a significant expansion of the ombudsman's scope of work, shifting it from a primarily advisory and facilitative function to a more decisive authority with high compensation powers and jurisdiction over disputes of any value as against the current limit of Rs 50 lakh under the integrated ombudsman scheme.","The move is aimed at providing a cost-effective, non-adversarial mechanism to handle complaints against regulated entities.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index surged more than 4% on Monday, hitting record highs after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) elected Sanae Takaichi, an ultra-conservative and close ally of late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as its new leader, paving the way for her to become Japan’s first female prime minister.The broader Topix index also advanced 2.3%, buoyed by investor optimism that Takaichi will continue Abe’s pro-market and stimulus-heavy economic policies.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index edged 0.1% lower to 27,119.36, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was largely unchanged at 8,984.70.Markets in mainland China, Taiwan, and South Korea remained shut for holidays, AP reported.The yen weakened against the US dollar, falling to 149.79 per dollar from 149.33 a day earlier, amid expectations that Takaichi could introduce higher public spending measures, potentially adding to inflationary pressures. The euro dipped slightly to $1.1720.Takaichi, 64, is seen as a protégé of Shinzo Abe and has long admired former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Known for her hawkish views, she has vowed to strengthen Japan’s defence, boost industrial competitiveness, and implement measures to address demographic challenges such as the country’s ageing population and rising debt burden.""The Nikkei was on course to reach as high as 48,000 by year-end, but because Takaichi was chosen as the LDP leader, it shot up toward that level already,"" Hitoshi Asaoka, the chief strategist at Asset Management One told Reuters.""The market welcomes her spending policy, but whether she can achieve that goal is not certain, as the LDP is still a minority party. The Nikkei may retreat once before year-end.""An unconfirmed report suggesting that the US President Donald Trump may ease tariffs on auto parts and manufacturing materials also helped lift Japanese automakers’ shares.

The Trump administration is reportedly planning to unveil a financial aid package to support American farmers who are hit hard by China’s boycott of US soybean.The package could cost more than $10 billion, though discussions involving both treasury and agriculture departments are still in the early stages, according to a source cited by CBS.Top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Monday, ""We've had numerous meetings over the last week or two"" about ""what we're going to do"" to support farmers. He promised the administration would take ""big measures"" and said, ""those big measures are going to be public really, really soon.""Hassett also highlighted the urgent situation on farms, saying, ""Right now, the silos are full, and there are soybeans sitting on the ground with tarps over them. That's unacceptable to the president.""He added that the administration is ""calling up all our soybean customers around the world as part of our trade negotiations.""Data from the agriculture department shows that in 2024, China purchased $12.6 billion worth of US soybeans. However, as the 2025 harvest season begins, the Asian giant has not purchased any.Last month, US President Trump suggested that some of the financial aid for farmers could come from tariff revenue.The treasury department says the federal government collected roughly $215 billion in tariffs in the 2025 fiscal year, which ran from October 2024 to September 30, 2025, CBS reported.The president told reporters in the Oval Office on 25 September, ""We're going to take some of that tariff money that we made, we're going to give it to our farmers, who are, for a little while, going to be hurt until the tariffs kick into their benefit,” adding, “So, we're going to make sure that our farmers are in great shape, because we're taking in a lot of money.""","The package could cost more than $10 billion, according to a source cited by CBS.

US President Donald Trump on Monday approved plans to build a 211-mile road through remote parts of Alaska to open up access to valuable mineral deposits, including copper, cobalt and gold.The Ambler Road project, located north of Fairbanks, had first been cleared during Trump’s earlier term in office, however, the Biden administration later halted it, citing threats to caribou and other wildlife, as well as to Alaska’s Native tribes that depend on hunting and fishing.At a ceremony in the Oval Office, Trump said the project “is something that should’ve been long operating and making billions of dollars for our country and supplying a lot of energy and minerals.” He also criticised former President Joe Biden, saying he “undid it and wasted a lot of time and a lot of money, a lot of effort. And now we’re starting again. And this time we have plenty of time to get it done.""The White House also announced a 10% equity stake in Trilogy Metals, a Canadian firm developing the Ambler site with an Australian partner, AP reported.In a separate move last week, the US government also announced buying a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas and a 5% stake in its Thacker Pass lithium project in Nevada, which is being developed with General Motors.Interior secretary Doug Burgum highlighted the strategic importance of the project, saying it will provide access to minerals “that we need to win the AI arms race against China.” Supporters, including Alaska’s congressional delegation, have emphasised the economic potential, noting the copper deposits could be worth more than $7 billion. Copper is essential in electronics, vehicles, and renewable energy technologies.But the project faces strong opposition. A coalition of 40 federally recognised tribes warns that the road could threaten traditional subsistence hunting and fishing, and damage salmon and caribou habitats.Karmen Monigold, an Inupiaq member of Protect the Kobuk, expressed deep concern. “And then I reminded myself of who we are, and who our people are and how far we’ve come,'' she said. “They tried to assimilate us, to wipe us out and yet we’re still here. We still matter.” She indicated that Alaska Native groups may once again pursue legal action to block the road, as reported by AP.The proposed two-lane gravel road would cut through 26 miles of Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve and cross 11 rivers and thousands of streams before reaching the planned mine site.Last month, the Republican-controlled House approved legislation allowing wider mining and drilling on public lands, reversing land protections put in place under Biden to limit fossil fuel extraction and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Trump and his allies argue that opening up the land will create jobs, increase revenue, and secure critical minerals for national security.The US president has often said, “drill, baby, drill,” and supported “mine, baby, mine,” Burgum said. “We’ve got to get back in the mining business.”Trump's order states that the proposed road is in the public interest, given US needs for domestic critical minerals, and says there is no economically feasible alternative route.","US President Donald Trump approved plans to build a 211-mile road through remote parts of Alaska to open up access to valuable mineral deposits.

Trump’s face on $1 coins? New American currency in process; ‘no profile more emblematic’ says treasury,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-face-on-1-coins-new-american-currency-in-process-no-profile-more-emblematic-says-treasury/articleshow/124352412.cms,"



The Trump administration has entered yet another series of controversy, this time over plans of issuing a $1 coin featuring US President Donald Trump, despite a 1866 law stating that only deceased individuals may appear on the American currency.Last week the initial designs released by the US treasurer were met with criticism, as some accused the administration of bending the rules to allow Trump to honour himself. The 1866 law was introduced to prevent any impression that America was operating like a monarchy by featuring living leaders on money, according to the New York Times.The treasury department responded on Monday claiming that the coin is legal under the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020.Quoting the legislation, the department said that treasury secretary Scott Bessent is authorised to issue coins “with designs emblematic of the United States semiquincentennial,” and that the coin reflects Trump and his vision for the country.“On this momentous anniversary, there is no profile more emblematic for the front of this coin than that of our serving President, Donald J Trump,” the treasury department wrote on social media platform X.Draft designs show the coin’s “heads” side featuring Trump’s profile, while the “tails” side would portray him standing in front of the American flag, pumping his fist beneath the words “Fight, Fight, Fight.” The coin is set to enter circulation in 2026 and will be legal tender.However, the 2020 law places restrictions on reverse-side designs, stating that “no head and shoulders portrait or bust of any person, living or dead, and no portrait of a living person may be included in the design on the reverse of specified coins.”Just like many Trump administration initiatives proceed, the matter could ultimately end up in court to be settled.The rule barring living people from appearing on currency dates back to 1866, after Spencer Clark, then head of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, put his own image on a five-cent note and had numerous copies printed before it was noticed.An archived treasury webpage that once explained the law, has since been removed.The cost of producing the coin is not yet known and will largely depend on the materials used and how many coins are minted, the New York Times reported.The coin announcement comes months after Trump ordered the Treasury to stop producing pennies, saying they cost more to make than they are worth.Trump has previously sparked currency controversies. During his first term, he blocked plans to feature Harriet Tubman on the $20 note, dismissing the proposal as “pure political correctness.”",The US Treasury is planning to issue a $1 coin featuring US President Donald Trump.

Pak PM Sharif And Munir Face Backlash After Rare Earth Shipment To US, Ex-PM's Party Questions Deal





In a shifty effort to put on a solid footing a relationship with Washington that was on the rocks for almost two decades, Pakistan has exported the first consignment of minerals purportedly containing rare earths to the US.The Pakistan government revealed over the weekend that in a “historic milestone for bilateral cooperation,” it has “successfully delivered its first batch of enriched rare earth elements and critical minerals” to US Strategic Metals (USSM), a private company in Missouri with which one of its state-owned entities had signed a $ 500 million partnership early September.The export follows a presentation the Pakistan’s hybrid military-civilian leadership made to President Trump in the White House late last month. China has a near monopoly over export of rare earth elements, vital in a range of industries from automobiles to rocketry to advanced computing, and the US is trying to overcome Beijing’s stranglehold.""Today, Pakistan steps forward as a credible and trusted partner in building secure and diversified supply chains for the future of our two nations."" Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was quoted as saying by the PR Newswire, an agency that distributes content for a fee.It disclosed that “In this first shipment, Pakistan has indigenously sourced and prepared: Antimony, Copper concentrate; and rare earth elements with neodymium and praseodymium. ”However, the PR appeared to be more optics than based on reality. Neodymium and praseodymium are primarily present in the form of compounds within specific minerals. They are almost never found as pure, free metals. It takes years, even decades to separate, and refine rare earth elements (REEs) from their mineral ores (which is what Pakistan has sent).Even the US does not have full self-sufficiency in the entire rare earth supply chain. Only one American company, MP Materials, which operates the Mountain Pass Mine in California, is reported to run an active rare earth mine in the country, and even it exports concentrates to China for final processing. Only after the current tariff fiasco which resulted in China cutting off rare earths to America has the US embarked on a ""mine-to-magnet"" domestic supply chain, and even that is expected to take years to develop. Some estimates put this at 10 to 20 years.Still, the press release talked up the “strategic and economic significance,” for Pakistan’s from its entry into the global minerals supply chain, with the potential to generate billions in revenues, large-scale job creation, and technology transfer, adding that Pakistan’s natural resources are estimated at around 6 Trillion USD making it one of the largest precious metals and rare earth minerals on the world.For the United States, it is a strategic safeguard ensuring resilience and independence from external monopolies, while securing vital inputs for its defense, energy, and high-tech sectors, Pakistan said through the PR agency.""We see this as the first step in our exciting journey together with the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) of Pakistan, to provide critical minerals to the United States and bolster economic trade and friendship between our two countries,"" Stacy W. Hastie, CEO of USSM, was quoted as saying.The agreement between USSM and FWO creates a framework for joint development of the entire mineral value chain—including exploration, beneficiation, concentrate production, and eventual establishment of refineries in Pakistan, it said, adding that “with this first delivery completed and a multi-phase investment framework underway, Pakistan is now positioned as a rising force in the global critical minerals economy—and a long-term partner to the United States. ”","Pakistan has exported the first consignment of minerals purportedly containing rare earths to the US.

Tariff refund nightmare

More than half of tariff revenue at risk of refund

Tariff collections: Trump admin may not let go easily





Donald Trump administration’s tariff collections - running into billions of dollars - is threatened in case the Supreme Court decides to strike down the US President’s tariff policies. Trump himself has warned that any decision against his tariff policies would spell disaster.Businesses, which have paid huge amounts in the last few months due to country-based tariffs, believe that getting back refunds in case the tariffs are deemed illegal by the Supreme Court, would be a nightmare.To begin with, this would create administrative challenges involving extensive refund processing. If these nation-specific tariffs are ruled unlawful, the United States might need to return most of the $165 billion in customs duties collected in the current fiscal year to the businesses that paid them, according to a Bloomberg report.However, obtaining refunds will be complicated; reimbursements typically come via paper cheques through a slow process, and whilst the government could expedite mass repayments, experts believe this is doubtful.""The customs authorities won't simply distribute refunds to importers freely,"" Lynlee Brown, global trade partner at EY was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.The uncertainty surrounding the potential refund process exemplifies the broader confusion that businesses and financial markets have experienced since the implementation of Trump's tariff policies.Several importers have abandoned expectations of receiving reimbursements, even if the court rules in their favour.""I have zero faith we'd ever get anything. Just zero,"" expressed Harley Sitner, who owns Peace Vans, a Seattle-based classic camper van repair and restoration business.Sitner told Bloomberg that the unpredictability of Trump's trade policies is more problematic than the actual tariff payments, which he views as irretrievable expenses. Following unexpected tariff charges ranging from $221 to $17,000, sometimes arriving months after receiving goods, Sitner has discontinued importing international inventory.""Just yesterday we got a small shipment from Germany worth $2,324 and it came with a $1,164 tariff charge. We can't back out,"" Sitner said.Various customs brokers report being approached by Wall Street organisations interested in purchasing rights to potential refunds, offering importers an opportunity to recover a portion of their possible entitlements.The significant increase in customs duties - a rise of $95 billion compared to the previous year - is primarily attributed to Trump's import tariffs affecting multiple economies, which became effective in August, as analysed by Bloomberg Economics. Two lower judicial bodies have ruled that Trump lacked the authority to implement tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.Should the Supreme Court uphold these earlier decisions, approximately 50% of the customs duties collected by the United States this year could be subject to refund. However, the process for businesses to reclaim these funds remains uncertain. Despite the government shutdown, tariff-related operations have largely continued uninterrupted.The United States Customs and Border Protection regularly processes refunds for importers in cases of overpayment or regulatory changes, with the Treasury Department issuing the payments. However, this reimbursement process is not automatically initiated.In line with statutory requirements, importers and their customs brokers must adhere to precise timelines and documentation procedures to maintain eligibility for refunds. Currently, the system predominantly relies on paper cheques for disbursement.Despite the Treasury's directive from the Trump administration to discontinue cheque payments by September 30, the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) only initiated its first phase last Tuesday in what will be an extended implementation process. The system's completion before any court decision appears unlikely without accelerated efforts.Tom Gould, a customs consultant from Seattle, suggests that potential refunds might result in ""it's possible that we'll see millions and millions of paper checks being mailed out because each shipment, each customs entry, will have its own.""The process could be problematic. According to the Bloomberg report, due to regulatory requirements, customs refunds are exclusively sent to sanctioned domestic banks in dollars, requiring foreign importers to receive their refunds through international postal services or utilise a broker's account within the United States.Worryingly, there has been a series of stolen cheque incidents in recent years. According to Gould, refund cheques were intercepted during postal delivery and traded on the dark web before being encashed.The administration possesses various options to expedite refunds, including automated processing of claims using existing system data. CBP has previously implemented refund rationalisation measures.Customs officials developed a framework to facilitate refund disbursement for items eligible under duty exemptions through the Generalised System of Preferences. Despite Congress allowing this programme to expire multiple times since the 1980s, it was subsequently renewed retroactively.Importers would input specific codes indicating GSP eligibility, even during programme inactivity. Gould suggested that the agency could similarly analyse internal data to identify IEEPA code-related tariff payments.Alternative procedures exist, though they might be complex. Legal experts indicate individual importers could be compelled to initiate separate legal proceedings to recover their funds.The authorities might require submission of protests or post-summary amendments, accompanied by comprehensive payment documentation and importer records, despite the government already possessing this information.EY's Brown recommends importers maintain complete records from CBP's Automated Commercial Environment platform, documenting entry dates and deadlines systematically to enhance refund possibilities.Despite potential simplified procedures by CBP, the complex nature of financial transactions within supply chains presents additional challenges.For shipments managed through commercial carriers like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc., who handle documentation and tariff payments, CBP would direct refunds to the registered importer - the courier service rather than the goods' owner.This arrangement could generate complications between the actual importers and courier services, creating another obstacle for businesses seeking reimbursement.Trump has valued the tariff income, declaring it has restored national wealth. He and his supporters have suggested various uses for these funds, including reducing national debt, supporting struggling agricultural sectors, and potentially distributing payment cheques to US citizens.This suggests the Trump administration will be reluctant to release these funds if the tariffs are invalidated, and they are likely to swiftly implement new levies using alternative legal frameworks should this occur. The Supreme Court is scheduled to review arguments in November regarding this matter.","Businesses have paid huge amounts in the last few months due to country-based tariffs.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

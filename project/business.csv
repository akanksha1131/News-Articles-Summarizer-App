Stock market recommendations: According to Bajaj Broking Research, UPL, and Chennai Petroleum Corporation are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for July 4, 2025:In recent weeks, the Nifty index has showcased remarkable resilience, maintaining its upward trajectory and investor confidence despite a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. The index formed a nine month high of 25,669 on Monday’s trade. Index thereafter consolidated in a 300 points range with corrective bias signaling profit booking at higher levels after recent strong up move.The index during the current week rebounded from the immediate support area of 25,400-25,350. Going ahead, the index holding above 25,400-35,350 on a closing basis will lead to a pullback towards 25,900-26,000 levels in the coming sessions. However, failure to do so may lead to a healthy retracement or consolidation, with the index likely moving within the broader 25,200–25,700 range.The percentage of Nifty 500 constituents trading above their 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) — a widely tracked measure of market breadth — has shown a notable and broad-based recovery in recent months. After bottoming out below the 10% mark in March 2025, a level historically associated with extreme bearish sentiment and oversold market conditions, the indicator has since rebounded sharply and currently stands at approximately 59%.This resurgence reflects a meaningful shift in market dynamics, transitioning from narrow leadership to a more inclusive rally. Importantly, breadth thrusts of this nature have historically preceded or accompanied sustained bull market phases. In prior cycles, similar recoveries have seen the indicator rise to above 90%, suggesting there may be further upside potential in the current move.The improvement in this breadth metric indicates that the ongoing rally is gaining internal strength, with a growing number of stocks participating in the upside. This is a constructive signal for medium- to long-term investors, as healthy breadth tends to support the durability of upward market trends.Key positional support lies at 25,200–25,000 levels being the confluence of the 20 days EMA and the upper boundary of the recent consolidation breakout area (25,200-24,500), which is expected to act as a support level, showcasing change of polarity, where previous resistance turns into support.Bank Nifty consolidated with positive bias at the all-time high during last month. Escalating tensions in key global regions, which typically heighten market volatility, have not deterred the index's momentum.We expect the index to extend the current up move and head towards 58,500- 59,000 levels in the coming month, the measuring implication of the last 15 sessions consolidation breakout (57050-55150).The Index has rallied 18% in the last four months, hence some consolidation cannot be ruled out at higher levels. We believe dips in the coming month should be used as a buying opportunity. Key support is placed around 56,000-55,500.The stock has witnessed a strong rebound after a base at the 100 days EMA signaling strength. It is at the cusp of breaking above the high of May 2025 (699) thus offers fresh entry opportunity.The weekly 14 periods RSI has recently generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias.We expect the stock to head higher towards 747 levels in the coming months being the 161.8% external retracement of the previous decline (699-618).The stock has recently generated a breakout above a falling channel in the weekly chart signaling strength and offers fresh entry opportunity.The breakout is supported by strong volume and the base of recent consolidation is placed at the 500 days EMA which supports the positive bias.The weekly stochastic has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average signaling positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 787 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the previous decline of October 2024 to March 2025 (999-433).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, UPL, and Chennai Petroleum Corporation are the top stock picks for today.

MCX Gold prices have shown strong momentum, rallying from the support zone of ₹96,000 and now inching closer to the ₹99,000 mark. This uptrend is supported by positive global cues and a bullish sentiment surrounding safe-haven assets. Geopolitical tensions, inflation concerns, and central bank policies have continued to push investors towards gold, boosting demandTechnically, gold has broken above short-term resistance levels and is now forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart — indicating sustained bullish momentum. The strength in the dollar index and fluctuations in U.S. treasury yields remain key global drivers, but domestic developments like tariff structures and festive demand could amplify the upside move.Traders are advised to maintain a buy-on-dips approach as long as gold sustains above ₹96,500 on a closing basis. Immediate resistance is seen near ₹99,000, and a breakout above that could open the gates for ₹1,00,500 in the near term. Overall, the outlook remains positive with a bullish bias for the week, backed by both technical and fundamental factors.MCX Silver continues to trade in a bullish structure, forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart — a clear sign of sustained upward momentum.The metal is expected to move towards ₹1,10,000 in the near term, as long as the key support at ₹1,05,500 remains intact. Technically, any pullback towards ₹1,06,000–₹1,05,500 could offer fresh buying opportunities with a favorable risk-reward setup.From a fundamental perspective, silver is gaining strength from both industrial demand and safe-haven appeal. With the global push towards green energy and electric vehicles, demand for silver — a key component in solar panels and battery technologies — is rising steadily. Additionally, the recent dovish stance by major central banks and expectations of potential rate cuts in the coming quarters have weakened the dollar and supported precious metals across the board.Overall, the outlook for MCX Silver remains positive. As long as the ₹1,05,500 support zone holds, the path of least resistance remains upward, with ₹1,10,000 being the next key target in the short term.","Both gold and silver prices are showing strength, with gold heading towards Rs 99,000, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

India-US trade: New Vietnam deal raises red flags; GTRI urges New Delhi to tread carefully,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-us-trade-new-vietnam-deal-raises-red-flags-gtri-urges-new-delhi-to-tread-carefully/articleshow/122217750.cms,"Representative image

A new trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam is sending ripples through Asian export markets, with Indian exporters being advised to take caution, according to a report by the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).The deal, announced by US President Donald Trump, imposes a flat 20 per cent tariff on all Vietnamese exports to the US, a move that could disrupt Vietnam’s $135 billion export flow and reverse two decades of trade liberalisation.“For Indian exporters eyeing Vietnam as a competitor and partner in regional value chains, the deal presents both cautionary lessons and strategic implications,” the GTRI report stated, according to news agency ANI.The trade pact replaces Vietnam’s 2000 Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), which allowed Vietnamese goods preferential access to the US at tariff rates between 2 per cent and 10 per cent. Key sectors like textiles, footwear, seafood, and furniture, which had driven Vietnam’s export growth from $800 million in 2001 to over $135 billion, will now lose that cost advantage.The new deal, as per AFP, also includes a punitive 40 per cent tariff on goods routed through Vietnam but originally manufactured in countries like China, a measure seen as targeting “transshipment” to evade stricter US tariffs.However, trade experts have raised legal concerns about this provision, warning that it may breach World Trade Organisation (WTO) norms since routing does not change the origin of goods.Trump announced the deal on his Truth Social platform, stating that “Vietnam will do something that they have never done before — give the United States of America total access to their Markets for Trade.” In return, Vietnamese exports face a 20 per cent US tariff, down from a previously proposed 46 per cent but still more than double the original BTA terms.Peter Navarro, Trump’s trade advisor, previously accused Vietnam of being a “colony of China,” alleging that a third of its exports were in fact Chinese goods relabelled to bypass tariffs. While Hanoi confirmed a resolution on reciprocal tariffs, it did not detail the final terms.For India, the timing of this deal is critical. The GTRI report cautions Indian negotiators, who are in the final stages of their own trade talks with the US, to learn from Vietnam’s experience, especially the risks of sudden reversals in tariff concessions, unclear rules on product origin, and flat duty structures that can undercut long-term trade stability.With Washington reshaping its Asia trade strategy, Indian policymakers and exporters are being urged to closely track developments and adapt proactively.The GTRI concluded that understanding the vulnerabilities exposed by the Vietnam deal could help India avoid similar pitfalls in its own trade trajectory.","New trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam is sending ripples through Asian export markets.

US plans ‘economic bunker buster’ bill: Will Donald Trump impose 500% tariff on countries importing oil from Russia? How it may impact India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/russian-sanctions-bill-us-planning-to-impose-500-per-cent-tariffs-on-nations-trading-with-moscow-how-will-this-impact-india/articleshow/122196023.cms,"The transformation in India's oil import strategy has been remarkable, with Russian oil's share increasing from less than 1 per cent to roughly 40-44%. (AI image)

EU Nations Buying Russia Oil ‘FRUSTRATE’ Zelensky; Ukraine President Goes On Ugly Rant | Watch





What’s the 500% tariff threat about?

The proposed sanctions legislation, which has garnered support from 84 co-sponsors as noted by Graham, seeks to exert pressure on nations such as India and China to cease purchasing Russian oil and commodities. The objective is to diminish Moscow's wartime economy and compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to engage in negotiations regarding Ukraine, whilst providing Trump with necessary authority.

The bill, first introduced in March, is anticipated to advance in August. This initiative aligns with the United States' intensified measures to impose stricter economic restrictions on Russia, as Trump attempts to persuade Putin towards diplomatic discussions amidst the ongoing Ukraine conflict.

The Senate postponed introducing the legislation following the White House's resistance to broadening sanctions during Trump's endeavours to improve relations with the Russian leader. Nevertheless, the administration now appears prepared to endorse these restrictive measures.

How will it impact India?

Hence, a 500% tariff on countries importing oil from Russia may impact India very badly. Incidentally, India has also stepped up oil imports from America. United States crude oil exports to India saw a substantial rise, reaching 439,000 barrels per day in June, marking a notable increase from the 280,000 barrels per day recorded in May.

Will Trump really sign the 500% tariff order?

Russia's Response to The Bill

India, a large importer of crude oil from Russia, may have to watch out for a new US bill which proposes imposing a 500% tariff on countries that import from Russia. In an interview with ABC News, Senator Lindsey Graham said that he wanted the US to impose tariffs to stop them from supporting Vladimir Putin's war machine. Moscow launched full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago on February 24, 2022.""Big breakthrough here. So what does this bill do? If you're buying products from Russia and you're not helping Ukraine, then there's a 500 percent tariff on your products coming into the United States. India and China buy 70 percent of Putin's oil. They keep his war machine going. My bill has 84 co-sponsors. It would allow the president to put tariffs on China and India and other countries to get them -- stop them from supporting Putin's war machine, to get him to the table. For the first time yesterday, the president told me,"" Graham said.Also read: 'Economic bunker buster for India, China': How this US senator's Russia sanctions bill would prove 'bone crushing' for trade- if passed Graham has actively been advocating for the legislation, cautioning that it would serve as an ""economic bunker buster"" for nations such as India and China, which have substantially enhanced their imports of Russian petroleum products.India significantly altered its oil procurement patterns after Russia's Ukraine invasion in February 2022.The country transitioned from its traditional Middle Eastern suppliers to Russian oil sources, capitalising on favourable prices resulting from Western sanctions and European embargoes. Russian oil deliveries to India stood at 1.96 million barrels per day (bpd) in May.The transformation in India's oil import strategy has been remarkable, with Russian oil's share increasing from less than 1 per cent to roughly 40-44 per cent of total crude purchases in a short period.Also Read | India laps up discounted crude: RIL, Nayara Energy get big chunk of Russia’s flagship oil exports; Reliance world’s single biggest buyer of Urals India's Russian oil imports reached new heights in June, surpassing combined imports from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, during a period of market uncertainty following Israel's major offensive against Iran.As the world's third-largest oil importer and consumer, India has secured roughly 5.1 million barrels of international crude oil, which its refineries convert into various fuel products including petrol and diesel.""According to preliminary analysis by global trade analytics firm Kpler quoted in a PTI report, Indian refiners are expected to purchase 2-2.2 million barrels per day of Russian crude oil in June, reaching a two-year peak and exceeding the total quantities acquired from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait.""India has also become the primary recipient of Russian Urals oil grade transported by sea in 2025, receiving 80% of the total exports. The country's two private refineries have substantially boosted their imports of this lower-priced crude.According to Kpler statistics referenced in a Bloomberg report, India acquired 231 million barrels of Urals through June 24, with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Nayara Energy Ltd. jointly obtaining 45% of Russia's exports of this medium-sour grade.The proportion of Urals purchases by these two private Indian refiners has steadily increased in recent years, particularly in 2025. Reliance has positioned itself as the world's largest buyer of Urals, having purchased 77 million barrels in the current year.Graham has clarified that Trump would retain discretionary power through a waiver provision, enabling him to decide on the bill's implementation should it successfully pass through Congress.""I was playing with him (Trump). He says, ""It's time to move -- move your bill. There's a waiver in the bill, Mr. President. You're in charge whether or not it's to be implemented."" But we're going to give President Trump a tool in the toolbox he doesn't have today. After the July break, we're going to pass a bill that with allow the president,"" Graham elaborated.Also Read | ‘Highest in two years’: India increases oil imports from Russia, US amidst Iran-Israel war; why it's about strategic positioning, not panic The Kremlin's official spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, addressed the remarks made by Graham on Monday, acknowledging that Russia had been monitoring the US senator's position and had noted his recent declaration.""The senator's views are well known to us, they are well known to the whole world. He belongs to a group of inveterate Russophobes. If it were up to him, these sanctions would have been imposed long ago,"" said Peskov.Peskov further questioned the effectiveness of such measures by stating, ""Would that have helped the (Ukraine) settlement (process)? That is a question that those who initiate such events should ask themselves.""","India is the world's third-largest oil importer and consumer.

"Moonlighting on rise, IT cos tighten checks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/moonlighting-on-rise-it-cos-tighten-checks/articleshow/122238021.cms,"BENGALURU: Amid low single-digit salary hikes and growing job market unpredictability, the IT industry is witnessing a sharp rise in moonlighting-related verifications.Companies now scan for overlapping employment - clear indicators of concurrent roles or undisclosed prior engagements.Such discrepancies are automatically flagged and escalated for client review. The final determination of risk or policy breach rests with the client, guided by their internal policies, risk tolerance, and candidate discussions.Background verification firm OnGrid reported a surge in screening activity. In the first six months of the current year, it processed 23,000 employment verifications-already 87% of the total 26,000 conducted last year. A key driver is employment history checks, often used to detect moonlighting. These checks flagged 2,900 cases in the first half of this year, up from 2,201 in all of last year. OnGrid tracks Universal Account Numbers (UANs), employment timelines, and personal records to spot overlapping jobs and undisclosed roles.Manav Jain, chief business officer at OnGrid, said that post-pandemic, with the rise of remote, hybrid, and freelance models, moonlighting cases increased.The flexibility of these arrangements made it easier for some to take on secondary jobs. Economic factors also push professionals to seek backup income or job security. During the pandemic, many employees were not fully engaged during typical work hours, and without robust monitoring tools, some used the extra time to take on additional work, which over time became habitual for some.Rahul Maheshwari, former Google employee and founder of edtech platform Linux Socials, said many professionals are turning to teaching as a side gig to cope with job uncertainty. ""Several work as freelancers, taking teaching assignments without going through the PF route. I currently have around 20 professionals from top MNCs who double up as instructors on the platform-many are here to cope with the current instability,"" he said.Maheshwari himself was asked to stop sharing tutorials on YouTube and LinkedIn after HR classified it as moonlighting. Though he insisted teaching wasn't moonlighting, he resigned to avoid friction-even though it didn't interfere with his day job.Background verification firm AuthBridge reports that 5 out of every 100 candidates engage in dual employment. Nearly 90% of these cases come from the IT services sector, mainly in Telangana, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. In one case, a developer was simultaneously employed at five companies, including two direct competitors. AuthBridge uncovered this overlap through PF records and Form 26AS.The shift to remote work during Covid also sparked a surge in multi-employment cases. OnGrid found one candidate joined 50 companies in a single year, worked seven years with 141 employers on record. In 2021, she added 21 more employers and was simultaneously on payroll at 10 companies. This included full-time roles at big names, startups, and established MNCs-not just freelance or contract work. In 2022, Wipro chairman Rishad Premji said the company fired 300 employees for working for direct competitors while being on Wipro's rolls.","In the first six months of the current year, OnGrid processed 23,000 employment verifications-already 87% of the total 26,000 conducted last year.

A letter of intent (LOI) was signed in March 2022, backed by demand drafts worth Rs 108 crore as performance security. However, IL&FS contends that Chronos failed to renew these drafts before their expiry on April 16 and 17, 2025, violating a clause which mandates a 15-day buffer before expiration.IL&FS maintains that this lapse automatically disqualifies Chromos and invalidates the letter of intent. The company also claims Chronos was aware of the clause, having previously renewed the guarantee multiple times.The dispute escalated in Aug 2024, when IL&FS issued an amended letter of intent seeking a revised consideration of Rs 1,296 crore, citing updated fair market valuation.

China is the world’s biggest supplier of these materials, producing nearly two-thirds of all rare earths and over 90% of refined output, according to the International Energy Agency.Wang defended the restrictions, saying the materials have both civilian and military uses and that China had the right to control their export. “This is part of our sovereignty,” he said.To ease concerns, China recently proposed creating a “green channel” to make it easier for rare earth exports to the EU, but many companies remain worried about disruptions to supply.Wadephul also raised the issue of China’s ties to Russia and the war in Ukraine, warning against the supply of goods that could support Russia’s military.Wang responded firmly, saying: “We are striving for peace and negotiation. We are not supplying lethal weapons to the parties involved in the conflict.”China says it is neutral in the war, but Western countries argue that Beijing’s trade and diplomatic support has helped Russia continue its offensive.Despite the disagreements, both sides stressed the need for continued cooperation. Wadephul said Germany and China must work together to tackle global problems, even as tensions grow over trade and security.Wang’s visit to Berlin was part of a wider European tour that includes France and Brussels, where he is trying to present China as a stable partner in contrast to the United States under US president Donald Trump’s leadership.","China has required companies to get licences before exporting rare earths.

"US job market slowdown: Donald Trump’s tariffs, hiring freeze may weigh on employment; data signals rare private sector contraction",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-job-market-slowdown-donald-trumps-tariffs-hiring-freeze-may-weigh-on-employment-data-signals-rare-private-sector-contraction/articleshow/122225523.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

The United States is expected to have witnessed a further slowdown in job creation during June, with President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs, hiring freeze, and immigration crackdown taking a toll on the labour market.As per news agency AP, the labor department is likely to report that just 115,000 jobs were added last month, down from 139,000 in May, according to estimates by FactSet. If accurate, this would mark the weakest monthly gain since early 2023.The unemployment rate is expected to tick up to 4.3 per cent, its highest level since October 2021, but still relatively low by historical standards. Economists say the US job market has cooled significantly since its post-pandemic boom, with average monthly job gains dropping to 124,000 this year, from 168,000 in 2024 and 400,000 between 2021 and 2023.While interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023 had initially slowed hiring, Trump’s unpredictable trade and immigration policies are now seen as weighing heavily on business confidence.“That whiplash has to stop and it has to stay stopped,” said Susan Spence, chair of the ISM manufacturing survey committee, referring to Trump’s stop-start tariff decisions that have left supply chains rattled and manufacturers hesitant to commit to hiring, as per AP.Private sector data signals further weakness. As per AFP, payroll firm ADP reported a surprise drop of 33,000 jobs in June, the first such decline in recent years, with job cuts mostly in education, health services, and business support roles.“Though layoffs continue to be rare, a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month,” said ADP chief economist Nela Richardson, adding that pay growth remained steady for now.Trump’s reimposed tariffs, including a sweeping 10 per cent duty on most US trading partners and higher levies on steel, aluminium, and autos, have increased business costs and stifled hiring. “Weinberg cautioned that companies are likely to respond to the chances of a tariff-induced hike in costs by becoming more aggressive about trimming their workforces,” AFP quoted Carl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics as saying.Some analysts fear this may be the start of a larger pullback.Federal employment also appears to be shrinking. Oxford Economics’ Nancy Vanden Houten expects a 20,000 drop in government jobs in June due to Trump’s hiring freeze, voluntary exits, and pending court rulings on layoffs.Meanwhile, immigration enforcement could be shrinking the overall labour force. In May alone, the workforce shrank by 625,000 people — the sharpest decline in 18 months, as per AP.While the data will be clarified once official numbers are released, economists warn that the slowdown could be deeper than anticipated.“We could be in for a downside surprise,” LPL Financial’s Jeffrey Roach said, cautioning that even if ADP data diverges from official figures, the broader hiring trend appears to be weakening, according to AFP.","The US is expected to have witnessed a further slowdown in job creation during June.

Asian shares inched higher on Thursday as investors awaited key US jobs data expected later in the day, hoping it would pave the way for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.The modest uptick in regional equities followed record closes on Wall Street after US President Donald Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, fuelling optimism over global trade momentum.According to Reuters, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 per cent, just below a four-year high. Japan’s Nikkei was flat, while China’s blue-chip CSI300 also gained 0.2 per cent.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, however, slipped 0.6 per cent as data revealed China’s services activity grew at its slowest pace in nine months.The US labour market is in sharp focus, with June’s non-farm payrolls expected to show a 110,000 job gain and the unemployment rate ticking up to 4.3 per cent. The stakes are high after a private payroll report on Wednesday revealed the first contraction in over two years. “These labour market indicators warn of the risk that the unemployment rate could spike to 4.4 per cent, the highest since October 2021,” said Tony Sycamore of IG, as quoted by news agency Reuters.Markets are now pricing in a 70 per cent chance of a Fed rate cut in July, up from 25 per cent earlier this week. Ten-year US Treasury yields eased 2 basis points to 4.265 per cent, while the dollar continued to face pressure, hovering near a three-year low.The euro edged up 0.1 per cent to $1.1807, and the pound also rose slightly as concerns about UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves' future faded.Investor focus also remained on Trump’s tax and spending bill, which proposes $3.3 trillion in new debt while cutting social safety net programs.In commodities, oil prices retreated after a sharp 3 per cent rise in the previous session. Brent crude fell 24 cents to $68.87 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate dipped to $67.21.As per Reuters, the drop followed a surprise 3.8 million barrel increase in US crude inventories and weak gasoline demand, which dipped to 8.6 million barrels per day during the peak summer driving season.Despite recent support from geopolitical tensions, notably Iran’s suspension of cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, concerns over soft US consumption weighed on prices. Analysts noted that any dovish signals from the Fed on Thursday could reverse this sentiment by improving the demand outlook.Meanwhile, gold prices slipped 0.4 per cent to $3,342 an ounce amid dollar weakness and pre-data caution.As per Bloomberg, the cautious optimism in equity and bond markets underlines the high-stakes environment ahead of the US jobs release, a key signal for monetary policy and market direction globally.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 per cent.

Tech firms and crypto startups are moving in on territory long dominated by Visa and Mastercard, powered by a new type of currency - the stablecoin - and a pitch merchants can't ignore: lower fees, faster settlement and a way to bypass the big two altogether.It's a tech threat and a financial threat. Digital tokens, which are typically pegged to the dollar, allow consumers to pay merchants directly from their crypto wallets - without routing payments through a bank or card network. Last year alone, US businesses paid an estimated $187 billion in swipe fees, most of it via Visa and Mastercard's systems.Stablecoins promise to make that toll much lower, or even obsolete. ""It's clear that eventually this entire space could be a threat to TradFi providers,"" said Christian Catalini, founder of MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab.That pressure is prompting Visa and Mastercard to brand themselves - not as old-school toll collectors - but as the backbone for all kinds of digital transactions, including those originally designed to bypass them. With Trump poised to sign the legislation that creates formal federal oversight of stablecoin issuers, they're touting enhancements to longstanding efforts in areas including stablecoin settlement and crypto-linked cards.Visa and Mastercard have also highlighted initiatives in cross-border payments, one of the most popular use cases for stablecoins. Visa Ventures invested in stablecoin infrastructure provider BVNK earlier this year. Mastercard recently announced it's joining the Paxos Global Dollar Network, allowing Paxos to help institutions on its network mint and redeem a stablecoin known as USDG, while also backing stablecoins including Fiserv's FIUSD, PayPal's PYUSD and Circle's USDC.","Stablecoins promise lower fees, faster settlement and a way to bypass the big two altogether.

Real estate and other business holdings: It’s least $1.3 billion

Prior to his involvement in cryptocurrency, a substantial portion of Trump's wealth originated from his real estate portfolio, encompassing hotels, residential developments, golf facilities and office buildings. Although this sector has experienced fluctuations, it continues to be a significant component of his financial portfolio.

Ascertaining the precise worth of his property holdings presents challenges, as his financial declarations provide only estimated values. His latest disclosure lists 19 real estate assets, each valued above $50 million, without specifying upper limits. The total declared value of his properties and business interests amounts to a minimum of $1.3 billion, excluding Trump Media and World Liberty.

Legal proceedings initiated by the New York attorney general alleged that Trump overstated his property values to obtain advantageous bank loans, culminating in a civil trial that imposed a judgment of nearly half a billion dollars against him.

These properties generate income, though without disclosure of operational costs and property investments, determining profitability remains impossible. In 2024, his Florida properties led in revenue generation: Trump National Doral golf club near Miami ($110 million) and Mar-a-Lago private club and estate ($50 million).

What is US President Donald Trump ’s net worth? Trump has often called himself a billionaire - but the actual net worth is not easy to assess. The exact value of Trump's assets remains unclear, primarily because his family enterprise operates as a private company with limited financial transparency.Recent data indicates Donald Trump's net worth has seen significant growth during the initial period of his second term, primarily due to his cryptocurrency investments, potentially reaching $10 billion or more. However, the majority of this wealth exists in non-liquid forms, requiring the sale of investments and business interests to convert into readily available funds, says a New York Times report.Donald Trump’s wealth portfolio includes real estate holdings, which present valuation challenges. Additionally, the shared ownership of various assets with family members and business associates complicates the assessment of his personal share.Also Read | From ‘dead’ to ‘hottest in world’: Donald Trump calls ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ the path to US making a ‘fortune’; says America growing out of ‘Biden mess’ Certain aspects of his financial portfolio, particularly his investments in stocks and cryptocurrency, are publicly accessible.

Here’s a deep dive, based on the NYT report:It’s a minimum of $2.2 billion distributed across stocks, bonds and cash instruments. The social media venture, Truth Social, operated through, represents President Trump's second most valuable asset, following his cryptocurrency holdings. His ownership of 115 million company shares amounts to approximately $2 billion at current market valuations.However, this valuation remains unrealised until share liquidation happens.

(A memecoin refers to a digital currency associated with internet culture or mascots, primarily used for speculative purposes.) The majority of the created $TRUMP coins remain under the ownership of Mr. Trump and his associates.Based on the current value of approximately $8.67, as of noon E.T. on July 1, these holdings were valued at roughly $6.9 billion. However, this valuation lacks liquidity: Trump's coins face trading restrictions, and substantial sales would significantly decrease the price. The precise distribution of ownership between Trump and his partners remains unclear.Additionally, Trump receives transaction fees whenever the memecoin changes hands. According to Chainalysis, a crypto analytics firm, these fees have generated at least $320 million, which is distributed between the Trump family and their business associates.The president's venture into cryptocurrency has proven highly profitable, extending beyond his memecoin success.

"Whopping $82.3 billion cost? Donald Trump’s tariffs may hit US employers in a big way, says JPMorganChase Institute analysis",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/whopping-82-3-billion-cost-donald-trumps-tariffs-may-hit-us-employers-in-a-big-way-says-jpmorganchase-institute-analysis/articleshow/122205626.cms,"Higher costs may push for alternate approaches

What comes after the 90-day pause

'Everything's going well'

US employers could be facing a $82.3 billion bill thanks to US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff regime, a new report has revealed. This could be a deep financial toll on American businesses, potentially triggering price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins.The report, Exposure to tariffs for midsize firms by metro area, published by the JPMorganChase Institute, is among the first to quantify the immediate impact on mid-sized American companies with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion, according to an AP report.These firms, employing roughly one-third of the country’s private-sector workforce, are majorly dependent on imports from countries like China, India and Thailand, with retail and wholesale sectors seen as especially vulnerable to the import taxes.The findings directly challenge Trump’s claims that the burden of tariffs would fall on foreign manufacturers, not US firms. While inflation has so far remained stable, retail giants such as Amazon, Costco and Walmart had anticipated disruption by stockpiling goods before tariffs took effect.The timing of the analysis is crucial, coming almost a week ahead of the July 9 deadline, set by Trump to finalise tariff rates on imports from dozens of countries.The deadline came after financial markets were rattled by his April announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period. Had the April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the same group of firms would have faced a steeper hit of $187.6 billion.Based on the current rates, the average cost per employee would be around $2,080 amounting to 3.1% of a typical company’s annual payroll. This also includes employees from firms that do not rely on import goods.“Our estimation explicitly considers direct costs, defined as costs to firms that physically import goods and pay the import tariffs, and is based on goods trade amounts from 2022, the latest year for which all data are available,” the report said.After the import tariffs come into effect the importer may switch to manage these costs through a variety of approaches. These might include raising sales prices or switching to a different supplier subjected to lower or no tariffs. However, it might also not be a feasible option as alternative suppliers may charge higher prices and in some cases, alternate suppliers might not even exist.As the 90-day period comes to an end, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework so far. India and Vietnam have also said that they are also close to locking in a deal with the US.There is a growing concern that tariffs might push inflation.Goldman Sachs forecasted that US companies are likely to pass along 60% of their tariff costs to consumers. A separate survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve also suggested that around half of the costs from 10% to 25% tariffs could be shifted to customers without affecting consumer demand.The JPMorganChase report also noted that the tariffs may present an opportunity for domestic manufacturers to strengthen their supply chains. However, given the already narrow margins in retail and wholesale, many companies may have little choice but to pass on additional costs to the customers.When asked on Tuesday about the status of ongoing trade talks, Trump offered a brief reply.“Everything’s going well,” he said.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent defended the administration’s strategy, claiming long-serving government officials have been impressed with the progress.“People who have been at Treasury, at Commerce, at USTR for 20 years are saying that these are deals like they’ve never seen before,” Bessent told Fox News Channel’s Fox & Friends on Tuesday.The Trump administration is also expected to begin mapping out its broader trade deal plans next week.In the meantime, Trump linked the success of the tariff policy to funding a newly passed multitrillion-dollar tax cuts package, which Republicans pushed through the Senate on Tuesday.","US employers could be facing a $82.3 billion bill thanks to US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff regime.

Tesla EV sales plunge! 13% drop in three months; anti-Elon Musk sentiment harms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-ev-sales-plunge-13-drop-in-three-months-anti-elon-musk-sentiment-harms/articleshow/122208236.cms,".

Elon Musk owned Tesla is feeling the heat as his political opinion has been casting a shadow over the company's sales since the last three months. Over the period, the sales of Tesla electric cars have fallen 13%, with predictions that the EV giant could also disappoint with its earnings.Between April and June, Tesla sold 384,122 vehicles, down from 443,956 during the same period last year. The drop highlighted a persistent backlash against Musk’s increasingly vocal support for US President Donald Trump and far-right political figures in Europe, despite earlier expectations that public anger might ease over time.The figures also raise concerns over Tesla’s upcoming second quarter earnings report, due later this month. In the first quarter, the company’s net income dropped by a sharp 71%, adding pressure to deliver more promising financials.Interestingly, while overall deliveries dipped, sales of the more affordable Models 3 and Y reached 373,728, beating Wall Street estimates of around 356,000. The better-than-expected performance in this segment gave Tesla shares a 4% boost in premarket trading.Earlier hopes for a rebound had grown after Musk officially stepped away from a role in the Trump administration, where he had served briefly as a cost-cutting adviser.","Tesla sold 384,122 vehicles, down from 443,956 during the same period last year.

No H-1B visa? No problem: Here are the top alternate US work visa options,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/no-h-1b-visa-no-problem-here-are-the-top-alternate-us-work-visa-options-explained/articleshow/122197561.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

Indian Students Face New Uncertainty: US Plan For Fixed-Term Visa Tenure May Impact Careersus visa

1. Planning ahead for future H-1B cycles





Begin early and be ready with the information in advance to ensure compliance with all requirements.

Consider other options to register, where applicable, within legal guidelines.

Track policy updates from USCIS that may affect the process.

2. Cap-exempt H-1B employment





Nonprofit colleges and universities

Nonprofit research organisations

Governmental research institutions

3. Intracompany transfers: The L-1 visa





The employee must have worked for the foreign office for at least one continuous year within the last three years prior to entering the US. The work must have been in a managerial, executive, or specialised knowledge capacity.

The position in the US must be similar to the role the employee held abroad, meaning it must also be managerial, executive, or require specialised knowledge. The US entity must also have a qualifying corporate relationship with the foreign entity (such as parent, branch, subsidiary, or affiliate).

This visa supports both short-term assignments and long-term employment in the US and may also provide a pathway to permanent residency through the EB-1C category.

4. The O-1 visa: For individuals with extraordinary ability





5. Country-specific visas





The E-3 visa is available exclusively to Australian citizens working in speciality occupations, similar to the H-1B. One of its notable advantages is that the spouses of E-3 visa holders are also eligible to work in the United States.

The TN visa, offered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), is available to citizens of Canada and Mexico. It covers a broad range of professional occupations, including engineers, scientists, medical professionals, and teachers. The TN visa is relatively straightforward to obtain and does not have an annual cap, making it a viable and efficient alternative for those who qualify.

The H-1B1 visa is specifically designed for citizens of Chile and Singapore. Like the H-1B, it allows individuals to work in speciality occupations, but with a separate annual quota (within the overall cap of 85,000) that is typically underutilised. As a result, applicants from these countries face less competition and a higher likelihood of approval.

6. J-1 visa: Interns and trainees





J-1 trainee visa: This category is intended for those who have earned a degree or professional certification and possess a minimum of one year of relevant work experience outside the US. The purpose is to enhance their skills in a structured training environment related to their current occupation. The maximum duration for a J-1 Trainee visa is 18 months, except for the hospitality field, which is limited to 12 months.

J-1 Intern Visa: This option is intended for current students or recent graduates (within 12 months of graduation) from a post-secondary academic institution outside the United States. Internships must closely align with the participant’s area of academic study. The maximum duration for a J-1 Intern visa is 12 months.

7. B-1 in lieu of H-1B visa







The employee must remain on a foreign payroll.

The work must be temporary, short-term, and within the employee’s area of expertise.

Requires meticulous compliance with rules to avoid visa misuse.

8. Further education opportunities





STEM OPT Extension: Students with degrees in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) fields may be eligible for a 24-month extension to their initial 12-month OPT, allowing them to work in the US for up to three years. To qualify, the job must be directly related to the STEM degree, and the employer must be enrolled in the E-Verify program. This extension offers additional time to build experience and submit a new application for the H-1B lottery in subsequent years.

Day 1 CPT Programs: Some universities offer Curricular Practical Training (CPT) that allows students to begin working from the first day of enrollment. These programs must be approached with caution, as misuse or non-compliant institutions can raise red flags during future visa or immigration reviews. Always consult with a qualified immigration attorney and choose accredited universities with strong reputations to ensure compliance.

9. Employment abroad and re-entry





It keeps the employee within the company’s ecosystem.

After one year, the employee may become eligible for an L-1 transfer to the US

10. Green card sponsorship





The H-1B visa lottery is a critical step for many companies in the United States looking to employ highly skilled foreign professionals.However, with only 85,000 visas available annually (including 20,000 reserved for those with advanced degrees from US institutions) and hundreds of thousands of applications submitted each year, many qualified individuals are left without a path forward.This leaves employers facing tough decisions about retaining top international talent.Fortunately, there are alternative visa options and strategic pathways that may work for your company. These can help affected employees remain in the US legally or return later with a more secure status.According to ET guest author Poorvi Chothani, managing partner at LawQuest, the key lies in planning, strategy, and using a combination of other visa pathways. She describes ways in which HR professionals can navigate this complex situation.Although an employee may not have been selected in the current year’s H-1B lottery, there’s always the potential for subsequent selection rounds.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may conduct additional lotteries if initially selected applicants do not proceed with filing. To improve the chances for next year you may want to:Some organisations are not subject to the H-1B annual cap. These typically include institutions such as:Employees can work for such institutions year-round without needing to go through the H-1B lottery.Furthermore, if they are employed at a cap-exempt organisation, a cap-subject employer may be able to file for concurrent employment, allowing them to work (often part-time) at both places simultaneously.If the employer operates offices or affiliated organisations in foreign countries outside the United States, the L-1 visa provides a strong alternative to the H-1B. This visa allows companies to transfer certain employees to a US branch, subsidiary, or affiliate:The O-1 visa is well-suited for individuals who have demonstrated extraordinary ability or significant accomplishments in fields such as science, education, the arts, business, or athletics.To qualify, applicants must meet rigorous criteria, which may include receiving national or international awards, having notable publications or scholarly contributions, or making original contributions that have advanced their field.This visa serves as a strong alternative for highly accomplished professionals who are not selected in the H-1B lottery, offering them a pathway to live and work in the United States based on their exceptional achievements.Country-specific visas provide valuable alternatives for individuals who are not selected in the H-1B lottery. These visa categories are tailored for nationals of specific countries and often come with less competition, making them more accessible compared to the standard H-1B visa:For eligible candidates, these country-specific visas can serve as excellent alternatives to the H-1B lottery, providing a legal pathway to live and work in the United States with fewer hurdles.The J-1 visa offers a valuable alternative pathway for individuals seeking to gain professional experience in the United States through structured exchange programs. Although not considered traditional work visas, J-1 visas allow participants to engage in on-the-job training or internships sponsored by approved organisations.There are two main categories under the J-1 visa that are relevant for professionals:While these visas do not confer the same employment rights as an H-1B, they allow participants to gain valuable US work experience under the supervision of a designated program sponsor.For temporary work assignments requiring specialised skills, the B-1 visa in lieu of an H-1B can be used under specific conditions:Employees on F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT) may consider continuing their education to maintain legal status and enhance future immigration opportunities:Employees not selected can also consider working for their US employer from an affiliated overseas office. This serves two purposes:Although it’s a long-term option for specific individuals who are subject to annual quotas based on their place of birth, starting the employment-based green card process signals a commitment to retaining valuable staff.While it does not provide immediate work authorisation, it lays out a pathway for permanent residence and work eligibility.Chothani concludes that although not being selected in the H-1B lottery can feel like a setback, “a wide array of alternative visas and strategies exist to ensure that valued international employees can still contribute meaningfully to US companies.”HR professionals are encouraged to collaborate with experienced immigration attorneys and maintain transparent, supportive communication with affected employees.(With inputs from guest column of Poorvi Chothani, managing partner at LawQuest that appeared in ET)","The H-1B1 visa is specifically designed for citizens of Chile and Singapore.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"
"Find less costly ways to address pension concerns instead of OPS, says Raghuram Rajan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/find-less-costly-ways-to-address-pension-concerns-instead-of-ops-says-raghuram-rajan/articleshow/98457871.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme and suggested that some less costly ways should be found to address the demands of government pensioners.Rajan further said the old pension scheme does involve massive future outlays because of the indexation of pensions to current salaries.""This is an enormous obligation, not necessarily in the short run, but in the long run,"" he said, adding obviously, state governments have to think through the long-term implications for government finances, and whether civil servants are the most in need of help among the constituencies they deal with.Rajan, currently Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said as he understands it, it may be infeasible technically or legally to move back to the old pension scheme.""If so, there may be less costly ways of addressing the concerns that prompt such moves,"" Rajan told PTI in an email interview.In a major move, a select group of central government employees have been given a one-time option to opt for old pension scheme.The employees who joined the central government services against posts advertised or notified before December 22, 2003, the day National Pension System ( NPS ) was notified, are eligible to join the old pension scheme under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 (now 2021).Under Old Pension Scheme (OPS), employees get a defined pension. An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

Small Wonders of India's Exports

India's Exports

India’s exports basket is seeing a big growth with some surprise items! The country’s export portfolio is diversifying with significant growth in unexpected items like bananas, ghee, furniture, office supplies, and solar photovoltaic (PV) modules. Whilst traditional exports like engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery remain dominant, these emerging sectors are providing additional momentum to overseas trade.India's export performance requires diversification, particularly given the 4.83% decline in goods exports during November, affecting sectors like petroleum products, gems and jewellery, iron ore, and agricultural produce.The commerce and industry ministry has set an ambitious target to surpass £800 billion in combined goods and services exports for FY25.""Banana is among the 20 agri products we have identified whose exports we want to boost as, at present, India's share is low in their global exports,"" an official told ET.The government has identified several agricultural products including watermelons, ghee, guavas, green chilli, capsicum, okra, garlic, onions and alcoholic beverages for export promotion.India aims to increase its global export share to 4-5% in the coming years from the current 2.5%. Countries like the US, Malaysia, Canada, Russia, Germany, France, South Korea, China, Indonesia, Japan, Italy, Belgium and the UK present substantial opportunities.""The acceptance for Indian single malt whisky is growing in the EU, US and the far East,"" said Anant Iyer, director general, Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC).Alcoholic beverage exports increased by 8% year-on-year during April-October, with whisky exports rising by 16%. Officials also noted growth in specific spice exports, particularly black pepper.Office stationery products are gaining popularity in markets like Nicaragua, El Salvador and Cyprus. India has become the sixth largest exporter of solar PV modules globally, with its share in global exports increasing to 2.51% in 2023 from 0.4% in 2013.Also Read | Top 10 Countries With Highest Gold Reserves 2024: India Moves Up Ranks! Where do the US, China Stand? Check List During April-October, India's exports of PV cells in modules or panels reached $711.95 million, with the US receiving 96% of these shipments. According to Deepali Agrawal, deputy managing director of India Exim Bank, toy exports are expected to maintain their growth trajectory.""Furthermore, the export of dyes, organic chemicals, and inorganic chemicals is projected to remain strong, supported by improving global demand sentiments,"" she said.The PLI schemes are expected to bolster electronics and engineering goods sectors, maintaining their position as key growth drivers.""The automotive sector is also set to witness a surge in export revenues, underpinned by improving global demand in key markets and the adoption of the China+1 strategy by global players, which is driving diversification in sourcing and manufacturing locations,"" Agrawal said.""India's apparel exports are also likely to maintain their upward trajectory.""Despite potential challenges in petroleum product exports, analysts indicate that non-oil merchandise and services exports will lead the country's overall export performance. The government is actively exploring new markets, including France, Saudi Arabia and Kenya for iron ore exports.For pharmaceutical exports, the focus is on Latvia, Chad and Montenegro, whilst Greece and Croatia are being targeted for engineering goods. Additionally, Guatemala and Morocco are being developed as new destinations for Indian cotton yarn exports.","The commerce and industry ministry has set an ambitious target to surpass £800 billion in combined goods and services exports for FY25.

Pay hike boom! Global capability centres (GCCs) are expected to offer more substantial salary increases compared to Indian IT service providers in the upcoming fiscal year beginning April, as these multinational subsidiaries aim to retain crucial talent essential for their continued expansion.GCCs have established themselves as organisations offering better compensation than domestic IT companies, whilst also maintaining a more aggressive hiring strategy.According to estimates from mass recruitment firm Teamlease shared with ET, IT services firms are projected to implement salary increases of 5-8% on average for FY26, with top performers receiving 12-14%.GCCs, however, are expected to provide an average increase of 10%, while exceptional performers could receive 15-20% increments.According to Teamlease Digital chief executive Neeti Sharma, GCCs are currently offering 15-20% higher starting salaries to new graduates in artificial intelligence/machine learning and cloud positions during this financial year.Whilst junior and mid-level positions show considerable salary variations, senior roles with over eight years of experience see similar salary increases of 27-29% across both GCCs and IT services.Cloud engineering positions show the smallest salary gap between GCCs and IT firms across all levels, indicating strong market demand for these specialists, Sharma noted.For positions including robotic process automation developer, internet of things engineer and full-stack developer, GCCs offer approximately 12-15% higher compensation, she indicated.In UI/UX design, GCCs provide notably higher compensation with ""a median salary of Rs 27.3 lakh per annum, compared with Rs 11.7 lakh in the IT sector,"" Sharma said.She attributed this difference to GCCs' focus on product development and user research capabilities, which represent newer functional areas.","GCCs have established themselves as organisations offering better compensation than domestic IT companies.

Around Rs 40,000 crore has come from budgetary allocation as the overall capex is lower this year due to award of fewer contracts and approval of lesser new projects, and fall in land acquisition.NHAI’s debt was pegged at around Rs 3.3 lakh crore at the start of April and is now estimated to have come down to around Rs 2.8 lakh crore. Loans from the National Small Saving Fund and some commercial banks, which charge high interest rates, have been prepaid, an official said, adding that pre-payment will help save interest cost of around Rs 1,200 crore.“The prepayment of loan has been made to National Small Saving Fund (NSSF) and some commercial banks, which charge high interest rates. Around Rs 15,700 crore has been prepaid from the InvIT monetisation proceeds,” said an official.For the current financial year, govt has set the target of raising around Rs 39,000 crore from monetisation of completed projects and funds raised through this route will be used to further repay loans.Earlier, the total loan had touched the maximum of Rs 3.5 lakh crore in 2021-22 as the highways authority continued heavy borrowing for around six consecutive years for road development. Considering the high burden of debt, the govt stopped NHAI from fresh borrowings and the overall budgetary allocation has been increased substantially.NHAI’s assessment showed that its repayment obligations would peak to Rs 62,000 crore in 2027-28, while its toll revenue would rise to Rs 69,000 crore, leaving it with a small surplus.It is also banking on a massive jump in revenue from wayside amenities, complexes along NHs being developed for rest and refreshment of commuters having facilities for staying, fuel station, food courts and other facilities, which is projected to rise to nearly Rs 1,400 crore by 2027-28.The estimates put together by NHAI are seen to be aimed at countering this perception and suggest that it has not taken over liabilities beyond its capacity to pay back.","NHAI’s debt was pegged at around Rs 3.3 lakh crore at the start of April.

Vande Bharat sleeper hits 180 kmph in trials! Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has shared a video of the Vande Bharat sleeper train trials which shows the train hitting a peak speed of 180 kmph during its trials. The first prototype of the Vande Bharat sleeper is currently undergoing RDSO field trials.According to Indian Railways , recent trials of the Vande Bharat sleeper train have demonstrated its capability to reach 180 kilometres per hour. These trials will continue through the month's end before the Vande Bharat sleeper is introduced for passenger travel.The Vande Bharat sleeper, as the name suggests, is a sleeper variant of Indian Railways’ flagship Vande Bharat train. The new train has been designed and manufactured for long-distance overnight travel, and is said to be superior to the premium Rajdhani Express trains.In the video shared by Ashwini Vaishnaw, a nearly full glass of water is placed beside a mobile phone inside the Vande Bharat sleeper train. The steady water level, whilst the train maintains a speed of 180 kilometres per hour, illustrates the journey's smoothness, Indian Railways said.These achievements were recorded during three days of trials, concluding on January 2, when the fully loaded train reached its maximum speed of 180 kmph. For passenger operations the train will be cleared for 160 kmph speeds.The Vande Bharat sleeper train reached 180 kilometres per hour speed during a 30-kilometre journey between Kota and Laban in Rajasthan's Bundi district on Thursday.Previously, on January 1, 2025, it reached the same speed during a 40-kilometre trial from Rohal Khurd to Kota. That day also saw speeds of 170 and 160 kilometres per hour on the Kota-Nagda and Rohal Khurd-Chau Mahla routes.Following these trials, the Railway Safety Commissioner will assess the Vande Bharat sleeper train at maximum speed. The Vande Bharat sleeper trains will receive official certification and begin regular service only after clearing this final evaluation.The soon to be introduced Vande Bharat sleeper trains come equipped with sophisticated features, including automatic doors, comfortable berths, internet connectivity and an aeronautical-inspired design.Currently, 136 Vande Bharat AC chair car trains operate throughout India on short and medium-distance routes, offering passengers reclining seats and premium travel facilities.According to Indian Railways, many technical hurdles were faced in incorporating berths and conducting comprehensive trials with full passenger capacity and baggage load whilst maintaining the target speed of 180 km/hour for the Vande Bharat sleeper coaches.Following successful testing, travellers can look forward to superior long-distance journeys on routes such as Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Delhi to Mumbai, and Howrah to Chennai, with notably reduced journey times, Indian Railways said.For comparison, the current average speed on the Mumbai-Delhi route is 90 km/hr, with Tejas Rajdhani Express achieving the highest permitted speed of 140 km/h amongst all Rajdhani services in India.","Vande Bharat sleeper train trials have demonstrated its capability to reach 180 kilometres per hour.

Besides offering higher returns for those aged 80 and above under its Patron deposits, the bank has structured schemes where customers can decide their savings goals, such as Rs 1 lakh, and sign up for recurring deposits accordingly.The rate revision comes at a time when there is widespread demand for a rate cut by RBI to boost growth. Meanwhile, RBI data showed that bank deposits and bank credit were growing at the same pace of 11.5% as of mid-Dec.An increase by the two largest banks usually leads to similar revisions by other lenders. However, sources said that HDFC Bank's rate revision was merely helping the bank catch up with others. Higher deposit rates also translate into higher borrowing costs because of a revision in the marginal cost of lending rates, which are directly linked to the cost of deposits.Bank of Baroda, the first major lender to announce business figures for the quarter ended Dec 2024, said its global advances and global deposits grew 11.7% and 11.8%, respectively.SBI's 'Har Ghar Lakhpati' - a pre-calculated recurring deposit scheme - is designed to help customers accumulate Rs 1 lakh or multiples thereof. This product simplifies the process of achieving financial goals, allowing customers to plan and save effectively. It is also available to minors, encouraging early financial planning and the development of a savings habit.""We aim to create goal-oriented deposit products that not only enhance financial returns but also align with our customers' aspirations. We are redefining traditional banking to make it more inclusive and impactful,"" SBI chairman C S Setty said.The highest rate offered by HDFC Bank on its bulk deposits is 7.4% on tenures starting from one year to 15 months. It offers 6.6% to 7% on deposits between one and five years.SBI offers domestic term deposit rates with the highest interest rates under its ""444 days"" (Amrit Vrishti) scheme at a rate of 7.25%, effective from July 15, 2024. Senior citizens are offered an interest rate of 7.75%. The scheme is valid until March 31, 2025.For regular deposits, the highest rate of 6.75% is offered to the general public, and 7.25% for senior citizens, on deposits with tenures between 3-5 years. Deposits for 5 years and up to 10 years also offer the same interest rates as 3-5 year deposits. For shorter tenures, SBI offers interest rates ranging from 3.5% to 6.5% for the general public and 4% to 7% for senior citizens, depending on the deposit period.",HDFC Bank has revised returns on bulk deposits (Rs 5 crore and above) by 5-10 basis points. SBI's revision is part of a strategy to innovate on deposits to capture a larger share of savings. Higher deposit rates translate into higher borrowing costs because of a revision in the marginal cost of lending rates.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116924388,imgsize-42006,width-400,resizemode-4/116924388.jpg"
Small AI Models: Tata Group chairperson Chandrasekaran predicts smaller AI models as the next big thing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-group-chairperson-chandrasekaran-predicts-smaller-ai-models-as-the-next-big-thing/articleshow/116939301.cms,"Tata Group chairperson Chandrasekaran predicts smaller AI models as the next big thing

CHENNAI: Tata Group chairperson N. Chandrasekaran anticipates significant investments in smaller, domain-focused artificial intelligence (AI) models, which he believes will have more relevance than large language models (LLMs). These smaller models consume less energy, are more cost-effective, and deliver faster results. He also emphasized the need to reduce energy costs and explore sources beyond solar and wind, such as small modular reactors (SMRs).Speaking at NIT Trichy's global alumni meet, he said, “2023 showed remarkable hype or opportunity through LLMs. It became the most talked about word and it is no longer a buzzword. In 2024 we saw enormous opportunities with multimodal capability for the AI engines…I think 2025 is going to be the year where there is going to be a huge investment towards small language models.”While LLMs will continue to play a role, Chandrasekaran stressed that small language models will have a deeper impact because they consume less energy, lower costs, and deliver faster results within specific domains. “I feel this is going to be a phenomenal year for AI,” he remarked.Addressing global green energy transition challenges, Chandrasekaran noted that the world’s total energy requirement is increasing, driven by efforts to revive industrial growth and the rising use of AI and data centres.He underscored the importance of reducing energy costs for economic growth. “In my view, the single most critical issue for global growth and prosperity is the cost of energy,” he said, adding that this would require significant investment and innovation in new energy forms, including SMRs.It is worth noting that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the opening up of the nuclear sector for private investment. Presenting the 2024-25 budget, she stated that the government would partner with private players to establish Bharat Small Reactors and invest in research and development of SMRs.Chandrasekaran further said, “I say this with conviction: India is perhaps the only country uniquely positioned to take advantage of and benefit from these three trends and transitions, coupled with geopolitics.”State information technology minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan also attended the event.","Tata Group chairperson N.

While October saw a spike in economic activity, it tapered down in November as was first seen in indicators like payments.Current high-frequency indicators reflect a slowing of momentum, according to Kaushik Das, an economist with Deutsche Bank. ""GST growth in December 2024 was only 7.3% year-on-year, the fourth consecutive month of single-digit growth.

""We estimate India's real GDP growth to average about 6.5% YoY in FY25 and FY26, aided by policy support. This will be below the potential growth rate of the economy at 7-7.5%,"" he said in a report.A Motilal Oswal report said that economic indicators revealed divergent trends in Nov and Dec 2024, suggesting an uneven growth trajectory.

The contraction follows a 9.3% increase in Oct and 3% growth in Nov 2023, with the decline attributed to a sharp contraction in external trade. Faster growth in imports relative to exports shaved 6.3 percentage points off GDP growth.""In several high-frequency indicators, Nov was the best month the Indian economy saw through FY24-25, but some moderation is already visible in Dec,"" Rahul Bajoria, an economist with Bank of America Global Research, said.","GST growth in December 2024 was only 7.3% year-on-year, the fourth consecutive month of single-digit growth.

Return of Indian startups from abroad





No new subsidies for electric vehicle sector

India is poised to achieve a remarkable milestone in its economic journey, with exports of goods and services projected to surpass $800 billion in the current fiscal year, said commerce minister Piyush Goyal on Friday.This anticipated figure not only marks a significant increase from the previous year's total of $778 billion but also reflects the resilience of India's export sector amid global economic uncertainties.""My estimate is that we will cross $800 billion in exports, another record given the world situation,"" Goyal stated.He further noted that India’s diverse export basket and the rapid growth of services exports have contributed to this resilience. However, he acknowledged challenges faced by developing and least-developed countries due to forex crises, the Covid pandemic, and disruptions in shipping caused by the Red Sea crisis.Despite these issues, India has seen significant growth in exports of goods and services, even in sectors with government-imposed restrictions. The minister also highlighted that rising imports reflect robust economic activity, driven by demand for machinery, equipment, and intermediate goods.On relations with the United States, Goyal expressed optimism about engaging with the new administration.""We are looking forward to a deep and substantive engagement with the new US administration...we are looking forward to working with (Donald) Trump administration again,"" he said, underlining the importance of bilateral cooperation in trade and economic growth.Goyal further assured that the government is dedicated to simplifying the process for start-ups seeking to relocate their domicile back to India from abroad.He stated that the ministry would consult with the National Start-up Advisory Council and gather feedback, ""if any steps are required to make their journey back easier. We are open to ideas"".""It is a welcome sign and also very very satisfying that more and more start-ups come back home and register in India, list in India, and grow in India. India will be a preferred destination in the future,"" he said.Initially, these start-ups registered abroad to benefit from easier access to international funding, higher valuations, and more relaxed regulations in various sectors.However, many are now considering listing in India after relocating.Goyal mentioned that the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has signed 50 MoUs with corporate entities, sharing their problem statements with start-ups to explore potential opportunities.The NSAC, which was formed in 2020, advises the government on fostering a strong start-up ecosystem, focusing on innovation, economic growth, and employment generation.Earlier in the day, Goyal spoke to EV stakeholders and asserted that India's electric mobility sector is ""absolutely ready to fly"" and no longer needs additional subsidies or incentives.He reviewed the progress in EV adoption, technological advancements, and challenges related to charging infrastructure and battery swapping.He further reaffirmed the government's commitment to tackling these issues and promoting the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in India.""After the interaction I can say that the electric mobility today is absolutely ready to fly. They do not need newer incentives or subsidies. The existing subsidies are available for some more time and will help them give that appropriate kick-start to the EV ecosystem. It's a good economic case to move from ICE engine to electric engine,"" Goyal said.The Minister highlighted key policy enablers, including the reduction of GST on EVs from 12 per cent to 5 per cent and on chargers/charging stations from 18 per cent to 5 per cent. He also urged commercial establishments and offices to set up EV charging equipment and called on industry bodies to raise awareness about the environmental benefits of EVs.Safety standards were a major discussion point during the meeting. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has already notified standards for three- and four-wheelers, with drafts for two-wheelers under review. Goyal urged stakeholders to submit their feedback promptly to finalise these standards.Regarding battery swapping, a system allowing EV users to exchange discharged batteries for charged ones, the Minister emphasised consumer choice. “It’s up to the consumer. Smart consumers will make smart choices,” he remarked.","India is poised to achieve a remarkable milestone in its economic journey, with exports of goods and services projected to surpass $800 billion in the current fiscal year.

'Unrealistic scheduling': US Transportation department slaps $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/unrealistic-scheduling-us-transportation-department-slaps-a-2-million-penalty-on-jetblue-airways/articleshow/116923380.cms,"Settlement

Chronic delays



The US transportation department has imposed a $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways for persistent delays on its east coast routes. Half of the fine would be distributed as compensation to affected passengers. This marks the first instance of an airline being fined for chronic delays on specific routes, which the department attributed to JetBlue’s “unrealistic scheduling,” the agency said.Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg criticised the airline, stating, “Illegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today’s action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality.”JetBlue, however, shifted part of the blame onto the government’s air traffic control system .Spokesperson Derek Dombrowski said the airline had invested “tens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays” caused by air traffic control challenges in key markets, including the Northeast and Florida which led to improved on-time performance in 2024, especially during peak summer travel.Dombrowski called the incoming Trump administration to modernise outdated air traffic control systems and address staffing shortages among controllers.The department identified chronic delays on JetBlue flights between June 2022 and November 2023. Problematic routes included flights from New York’s JFK Airport to Raleigh-Durham, Fort Lauderdale, and Orlando, as well as flights from Windsor Locks, Connecticut, to Fort Lauderdale.JetBlue has since agreed to a settlement over delays on four specific routes.“While we’ve reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four (routes) in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the US government, which operates our nation’s air traffic control system,” Dombrowski revealed.Under the regulations set by the transportation department, airlines must not publish unrealistic schedules, ensuring departure and arrival times reflect operational realities. A flight is deemed chronically delayed if it operates at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late in over half of those instances.","The US transportation department has imposed a $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways for persistent delays on its east coast routes.

What Bloomberg strategists are saying...

While the notable absence of a Santa Rally has previously led to a rebound in stocks for the month of January, the year’s first trading day doesn’t offer a great signal for the whole 12-month period. Over the past four years, for example, it has actually been a contrarian indicator, Deutsche Bank notes. The S&P 500 ended the year inversely of how it started.

Extending that analysis back to 1928, the year’s first trading day and the SPX’s annual performance have a poor correlation and have only moved in tandem ~50% of the time.

"Tesla global sales drop first time in 9 years, down by 1.1%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-global-sales-drop-first-time-in-9-years-down-by-1-1/articleshow/116893005.cms,"Fourth quarter sales fall short of expectations

Tussle with rival companies

Divided outlook

For the first time in at least nine years, Tesla's global annual sales have recorded a decline, dropping by 1.1 per cent compared to 2023. The electric vehicle (EV) giant delivered 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, a slight decrease from the 1.81 million sold the previous year.A 2.3 per cent hike in fourth-quarter sales, reaching 495,570 vehicles, was insufficient to offset a sluggish start to the year, despite incentives like 0 per cent financing, free charging, and affordable lease options.This decline is primarily attributed to waning demand for electric vehicles in the US and other markets. Analysts suggest that many early adopters have already purchased EVs, while mainstream buyers remain cautious about factors such as driving range, price, and access to charging stations for longer trips.Tesla’s fourth-quarter sales also fell short of Wall Street estimates, with analysts expecting 498,000 deliveries. Production figures revealed similar challenges, with 459,445 vehicles produced in the quarter and 1.77 million for the year, both falling slightly below the year's total deliveries.Adding to Tesla's concerns, the average sales price of its vehicles is estimated to have dropped to just over $41,000 in the fourth quarter, the lowest in at least four years, according to analysts polled by FactSet. This pricing pressure, coupled with once-unheard-of discounts, has weighed on Tesla’s industry-leading profit margins.The dip in sales challenges Tesla’s 2022 prediction of 50 per cent annual growth, as the company faces an ageing model lineup and increased competition from legacy automakers and startups in China, Europe, and the US. Nearly all of Tesla's sales came from its smaller, more affordable Models 3 and Y, with just 23,640 deliveries of its higher-end Model X, Model S, and the new Cybertruck.Meanwhile, Chinese rival BYD is closing in on Tesla’s lead as the world’s top EV seller, reporting a 41 per cent increase in sales to 1.77 million EVs in 2024. Tesla narrowly maintained its edge, but the competition underscores the mounting pressure on the Austin, Texas-based company.Tesla shares dropped nearly 7 per cent on Thursday following the announcement. However, the stock remains up more than 50 per cent over the past year, driven partly by optimism surrounding Tesla’s advancements in AI-powered autonomous driving technology and the prospect of regulatory easing under Donald Trump's re-election.Industry analysts remain divided on Tesla’s outlook. Daniel Ives of Wedbush remains bullish, ""We have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,"" he said in a report, adding, ""and the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.""William Stein, an analyst at Truist Securities, told news agency AP, that Tesla will struggle to sell vehicles in future months and expects further discounting used to boost sales will weigh on its financial results.Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for 29 January, will be closely watched by investors and analysts seeking clarity on how the company plans to navigate intensifying competition and demand challenges in the evolving EV market.","Tesla delivered 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, a slight decrease from the 1.81 million sold the previous year.

As we bid farewell to 2024 and step into 2025, the cryptocurrency landscape is reflecting on the remarkable trends and shifts that shaped the year. The market has been buzzing with discussions surrounding five standout cryptocurrencies: Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Rexas Finance (RXS). These tokens have captured attention due to their distinctive features, dynamic market movements, and promising growth potential. With the dawn of 2025, speculation is mounting about how these coins will fare in the upcoming market cycle and whether they will maintain their momentum or face new challenges.Solana continues to maintain a robust position in the market, trading at an average of $181.88 with a market cap of $87.2 billion. Its strong investor sentiment, coupled with a technical pattern signaling bullish momentum, has positioned it for further growth. Analysts forecast SOL to target a range between $156.33 and $211.22 by 2025, with the possibility of exceeding $264 if market confidence strengthens. This outlook is supported by Solana’s consistent performance and high transaction volumes, suggesting it remains a cornerstone for decentralized applications.XRP has emerged as one of the most discussed tokens of 2024. Despite losing nearly 20% from its December peak, it remains over 320% higher than its November low. On-chain data shows a significant rise in wallet activity, indicating strong community interest. Market analysts are optimistic about XRP’s potential, particularly as its charts display signs of a bullish resurgence. As institutional adoption increases, XRP is set to capitalize on its ledger's efficiency, reinforcing its relevance in cross-border transactions.Dogecoin’s price trajectory reflects a history of exponential growth during bullish cycles. Analysts note that DOGE has repeatedly surpassed key Fibonacci levels, and its ongoing symmetrical triangle pattern suggests a breakout may be imminent. With projections placing DOGE at $2.28 or higher, it could rank among the top three assets by market cap. The community-driven nature of DOGE continues to bolster its appeal, ensuring its position as a favorite in the crypto market.Cardano experienced a challenging year with a 9% weekly decline, but its price downtrend shows signs of stabilising. Whale activity has steadied, reducing selling pressure and pointing toward a consolidation phase. The $0.859 support level remains critical for ADA’s recovery, with potential to reclaim $1 in the coming months. Cardano’s innovative blockchain solutions and commitment to scalability make it a long-term contender, even amidst market fluctuations.Rexas Finance (RXS) has reshaped the crypto market through its focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation.

Chinese stocks tumble in worst start to a year since 2016,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-stocks-tumble-in-worst-start-to-a-year-since-2016/articleshow/116880502.cms,"Traders may want to limit China exposure in their portfolios as they position for 2025. (Representative picture)

Chinese stocks posted their worst start to a year in nearly a decade as investors braced for economic uncertainties with weaker-than-expected manufacturing data and an anticipated hike in tariffs.The CSI 300 Index closed down 2.9% on Thursday, its steepest drop on a year’s first day of trading since 2016. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid as much as 3.1%.The losses suggest sentiment remains fragile even after Chinese equities posted their first annual advance last year since 2020. There’s a lack of confidence over the country’s economic recovery, with the Caixin manufacturing survey coming in below estimates and Donald Trump ’s threat of higher tariffs looming large ahead of his inauguration later this month.A sharp fall in the CSI 300 in the last trading session of 2024 also pushed the gauge below the 60-day moving average, a closely-watched technical threshold, likely leading to further selling by some funds. Several large financial stocks including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China traded ex-dividend, exacerbating the benchmarks’ losses.China Stocks Slump on Data, Support Level Breach“It’s a bit troubling that investors are starting the new year in a cautious mode as this is happening after clearer stimulus signals from Beijing during its December policy meetings,” said Homin Lee, senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier. “The underlying momentum for China remains quite fragile, and it will take some efforts from the authorities to change the conversation on the country’s medium-term deflationary dangers.”While Chinese stocks rose 15% last year in a rare annual gain, a bulk of the increase came in the weeks following a late September stimulus blitz. The market has since been trading range-bound, with investors waiting for more significant stimulus to drive the market higher.Following the Central Economic Work Conference in December, China signaled more public borrowing and spending in 2025 with a shift of policy focus to consumption, in an effort to repair the economy’s weak link as looming US tariffs threaten exports.While that announcement has given investors hope that Beijing is determined to revive the economy, some market watchers note that there will be a lull in stimulus until March when the so-called Two Sessions — China’s annual legislative session — take place.Traders may want to limit China exposure in their portfolios as they position for 2025, according to Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.Global funds had already turned net sellers of Chinese stocks in November following two months of net inflows, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note dated December 4. Passive funds turned to outflows after heavy inflows in October while active funds accelerated net outflows in November, they wrote.As economic concerns linger, China’s 10-year bond yields hit a fresh record low on Thursday. The People’s Bank of China injected massive liquidity into the market at the end of 2024 without using high-profile stimulus, as officials preserve policy space before Trump returns to office.Equity trading volume was notable in Hong Kong on Thursday as markets reopened after a holiday, with that for the Hang Seng Index 50% larger than the average over the past 30 sessions. Meanwhile, turnover in Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses has remained below 1.5 trillion yuan ($206 billion) in recent days, suggesting traders are opting to remain on the sidelines until catalysts become clear.“The losses today look very much trading driven, as there was a bit of accumulated gains that would have prompted selling with the breach of technicals,” said Liu Dejun, fund manager at Beijing Kaiyuan Private Fund Management Co. “Many are also talking about avoiding too much stock exposure ahead of Trump’s inauguration, which is close to the Lunar New Year holidays.”","The CSI 300 Index closed down 2.9% on Thursday, its steepest drop on a year’s first day of trading since 2016.

Shiba Inu is one of the trending meme coins, following a 24-hour increase of nearly 4%. While this may seem like a drop from the massive promises that SHIB holds, it’s crucial to note that the SHIB price is coming from a low point of -10.23% in the past month. Similarly, Stellar (XLM) has been on the road to rediscovery after a pause in its growth.However, the Lunex presale has been a success so far, raising over $5.6 million in a few months. The Lunex project has been attracting meme coin investors. Let’s find out why.The SHIB price has been down by about 11% in the past month, with a price of $0.000023 at the time of writing. The dip in the meme coin’s price comes after a massive decline hit the broader crypto market, causing pessimistic Shiba Inu news among investors.Nonetheless, SHIB investors can find solace in its cumulative 113% growth in the past 12 months and get confidence from the coin’s recent bounce back. The SHIB price has gone up by almost 4% in the last 24 hours alone. According to the latest Shiba Inu news, the recent turnaround is a result of the recent post by Elon Musk, which showed a SHIB-like creature hovering over a city.Another coin that has been regaining bullish trends after a period of decline is XLM. Following a year-to-date of over 200%, the XLM price has dropped by nearly 30% in the past month. The drop in the XLM price has caused uncertainty among investors, as there have been sharp price rises and falls.However, a 24-hour surge in the XLM price raises speculation that the token may be regaining momentum. The XLM price has surged by over 4% in the last 24 hours alone. The same applies to the coin’s market cap, which suggested that the Stellar break could be over. However, another sharp fall could be in the offing.While established altcoins like SHIB and XLM have been experiencing a mix of sharp uptrends and downtrends, new altcoins like Lunex have been growing steadily during their presales. For instance, the Lunex price has increased across various levels of its presale and is currently trading at $0.0049. The low Lunex price is a bargain for investors, who are driving the token’s growth in the altcoin market.The interest in the Lunex project stems from the various features that set it apart in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The cross-chain Web3 platform allows the seamless flow of assets across multiple blockchains and over 50,000 crypto pairs. Its non-custodial blockchain operations also make asset exchange faster, cheaper, and more efficient.Moreover, Lunex users can leverage its non-custodial crypto wallet , which helps traders store, manage, and trade over 40,000 digital assets within a single mobile app. Plus, Lunex token holders can earn passive income by staking their assets in the platform’s liquidity pool . With up to 18% APY up for grabs, the staking feature provides a rewarding investment opportunity. There’s also a Lunex reward program, which rewards traders with cashback offers on every transaction they complete on the cross-chain platform .","Shiba Inu is one of the trending meme coins, following a 24-hour increase of nearly 4%.

Xi Jinping: China’s 2024 GDP growth set to hit target of around 5%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/xi-jinping-chinas-2024-gdp-growth-set-to-hit-target-of-around-5/articleshow/116835200.cms,"Xi signaled that support for the economy will continue into 2025.

Weak demand

Monetary easing

China’s gross domestic product is expected to expand around 5% for the full year of 2024, President Xi Jinping said, signaling the world’s second-largest economy is on track to meet its official target.China’s economy was “overall stable and progressing amid stability,” Xi said at a new year event on Tuesday, according to a speech published by the official Xinhua News Agency. Risks in key areas were effectively addressed, while employment and prices remained steady, he said.While a precise figure won’t be available until next month, the Chinese leader’s disclosure capped off a year of economic uncertainty, with the growth goal initially seen as a “target without a plan.” The outlook for 2024 improved after policymakers rolled out a slew of stimulus steps since late September, with economists now forecasting an expansion of 4.8% this year.Xi signaled that support for the economy will continue into 2025 during the New Year’s Eve remarks to the nation’s top political advisory body, reiterating a call to adopt more proactive macroeconomic policies.Later in the day in another new year address televised nationally, Xi acknowledged challenges facing China’s economy, including external uncertainties and shifting to new growth drivers, but called on the nation to remain confident in overcoming them.“In 2025, we will fully complete the 14th Five-Year Plan, implement more proactive and effective policies,” Xi said. “As always, we grow in wind and rain, and we get stronger through hard times. We must be full of confidence.”As in previous years, Xi also used his speech to reiterate the ruling Communist Party’s position on Taiwan. “No one can ever stop China’s reunification,” he said, alluding to Beijing’s longtime vow to bring the self-ruled island under its control, by force if necessary.China is expected to set a 2025 growth target roughly similar to this year’s, as top leaders signaled earlier this month they’re willing to embrace more forceful stimulus measures. That would help the economy counter any impact from potential increases in US tariffs after President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House next month.An official GDP growth target would only be revealed in March, when annual legislative sessions are held. Chinese leaders plan to set an annual growth goal of about 5% for next year, Reuters reported earlier. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimate 4.5% growth in 2025.Officials at key meetings in December pledged to use greater public borrowing and spending as well as monetary easing to spur growth in 2025, in an unusually direct call that sought to boost confidence. They endorsed the first shift in monetary policy stance in 14 years to a “moderately loose” one.But the economy is still weighed by weak domestic demand and an uncertain outlook for exports, which has been a key growth driver this year. Deflation is likely to persist well into next year, while the property market is still slumping.Beijing’s initial stimulus next year is expected to fall short of the kind of radical action analysts believe is required to stem the downward spiral in prices, but officials may step up support later when growth falters just as they did this year.Previously, Premier Li Qiang also revealed the nation’s growth rate ahead of an official announcement by the statistics bureau in a step to lift sentiment. He said the economy grew 5.2% in 2023 in Davos last January, while highlighting the fact that China did not resort to massive stimulus.China’s next easing step could come from the People’s Bank of China, which has yet to provide a liquidity boost to markets by cutting the amount of cash banks must hold in reserves — a move it previously flagged as possible by the end of 2024.PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng in October said the central bank may lower the reverse requirement ratio by 25 to 50 basis points depending on liquidity conditions by the year’s end. China’s top leaders at a key economic meeting in December also vowed to trim the RRR at an “appropriate time,” without providing more details.The PBOC’s decision likely took into consideration the need to stabilize the yuan. High-profile easing measures like a RRR cut could add to depreciation pressure on the yuan. That’s because it would worsen yuan assets’ yield disadvantage compared with dollar assets, triggering fund outflows. The yuan declined to its one-year low in December.The central bank likely withheld the RRR cut partly because the Federal Reserve signaled greater caution over how quickly it will lower interest rates, according to Bruce Pang, distinguished senior research fellow at the National Institution for Finance and Development, a think tank. The next window for a RRR cut could be after Trump takes office as US president on Jan. 20, he said.“The PBOC is preserving policy space to deal with increasing external uncertainties. Injecting too much liquidity could also make it harder to manage the yuan exchange rate and government bond yield,” he said.Liquidity in the interbank market remains ample for now, in spite of a seasonal rise in cash demand at the year-end period. The cost for top-rated commercial banks to raise funds from other institutions via one-year debt instruments hovered at the lowest since April 2020 at the end of December. Subdued loan demand may leave cash sitting idle in the banking system.PBOC is likely to lower the RRR in January before the Lunar New Year holiday — which begins Jan. 28 — if it doesn’t cut in December, according to analysts including Liu Yu at Huaxi Securities. Over the next year, the PBOC is expected to provide long-term liquidity by cutting the RRR and buying more government bonds.","China’s gross domestic product is expected to expand around 5% for the full year of 2024, President Xi Jinping said. The outlook for 2024 improved after policymakers rolled out a slew of stimulus steps since late September. But the economy is still weighed by weak domestic demand and an uncertain outlook for exports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116835253,imgsize-20034,width-400,resizemode-4/116835253.jpg"

Investors are looking for initiatives that can surpass the giants of the blockchain sector as the crypto market gets ready for an expected bull run in 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS) is a token with real-world utility, creative elements, and excellent presale momentum among these next rivals. Rexas Finance has already raised an impressive $33.5 million, selling over 382.7 million tokens at $0.175 in the 11th presale stage. The question is: could RXS be one of the best investments for the upcoming crypto boom?Rexas Finance is an ecosystem that revolutionises distributed finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenising, not just another cryptocurrency. With an advanced Token Builder provided by the project, companies and developers can build blockchain tokens without needing to have excellent technical knowledge. Particularly useful for companies looking at Web3 applications, this invention makes blockchain reachable to a larger audience.

This unique offering distinguishes Rexas from its rivals and helps the project align with long-term market developments.As of right now, Rexas Finance has had a fantastic trip. Beginning at barely $0.03 in its early presale phases, the token's price has risen almost six times, demonstrating robust investor confidence and market demand. Many experts believe RXS might reach $10 or more during the 2025 bull run as momentum increases. Many elements support this positive attitude. Thanks to its creative ecosystem and increasing demand for its token, Rexas Finance has shown the capacity to draw attention and money. The listing of RXS on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko has further improved its visibility, attracting a larger community of investors ready to contribute to its expansion. The consequent increase in accessibility and demand as the presale progresses and the token approaches listing on significant exchanges might propel the price to unprecedented levels. Furthermore, RWA tokenising is projected to become popular in the following years. Rexas Finance will likely be a leader as this market grows, benefiting from the higher interest and acceptance of its offerings.For individuals looking for profits and long-term value, Rexas Finance presents an unmatched investment possibility. The project's creative approach to DeFi and emphasis on practical uses help it rank highly among cryptocurrencies.

2024 becomes deadliest year in skies since 2018,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/2024-becomes-deadliest-year-in-skies-since-2018/articleshow/116809276.cms,"Commercial aviation has experienced its deadliest year since 2018 with 318 fatalities, including the Jeju Air disaster and the downing of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane. This reversal from 2023's record safety is marked by several tragic incidents, possibly exacerbated by global conflicts. Fatal aviation accidents, though rare, have surged this year.

Commercial aviation has suffered its deadliest year since 2018 after the Jeju Air disaster in South Korea and last week's downing of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane. Onboard passenger plane fatalities this year jumped to 318 with the two recent crashes, data compiled by Cirium shows. That's by far the highest death toll since more than 500 people died in 2018, a year marked by the first of two Boeing Co. 737 Max crashes. It marks a reversal from 2023 - the safest year ever in aviation with no deaths among large passenger jetliners. Fatal aviation accidents remain very rare.In Jan, a Japan Airlines jet collided with a coastguard plane at Tokyo airport. Everyone aboard the jetliner survived, but five people on the smaller aircraft were killed. In July, Nepal's Saurya Airlines crashed after taking off, killing 18. And in Aug dramatic footage of a plane operated by Brazilian airline VoePass captured its freefalling from the sky after encountering icy weather conditions. That accident killed 62. Global conflicts may also have contributed to this year's fatalities. The Azerbaijan Airlines jet had nearly completed a scheduled flight from the capital city of Baku to Grozny, Russia, on Dec. 25 when it was suddenly diverted across the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan. Azerbaijan's prez has said the plane was accidentally shot down by Russia.","Onboard passenger plane fatalities this year jumped to 318 with the two recent crashes, data compiled by Cirium shows.

Closure Of Bench Accounting: Bench Accounting Vancouver bookkeeping service shuts down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-based-bench-accounting-announces-sudden-closure-putting-hundreds-out-of-work/articleshow/116734374.cms,"Representative image

Former CEO speaks out

Competitors step in

Canada's Vancouver-based bookkeeping service Bench Accounting has announced its unexpected closure, leaving hundreds of employees without jobs and forcing thousands of customers to seek alternatives just days before the end of the year.In a statement posted on its website, Bench, which has described itself as North America's largest bookkeeping service for small businesses , revealed that as of Friday, the platform was ""no longer accessible."" The company acknowledged the abrupt nature of the closure, emphasizing that it would assist customers through the transition.As per CBC News, Bench had previously reported having over 600 employees and more than 12,000 US-based customers. The company had raised $113 million in investor funding. Initially founded as 10sheet Inc. in the US in 2012, Bench relocated to Vancouver and rebranded in 2013.With the unexpected shutdown, the company has outlined the steps its customers need to take to retrieve their data. They will be notified by December 30 and will be able to download their current and prior year-end financials, along with uploaded documents like receipts and bank statements, until March 7. Customers are advised to file for a tax extension to allow extra time to find a new bookkeeper to file their taxes.Calls to Bench’s Vancouver office went unanswered, with the line going directly to voicemail. In light of the closure, local officials expressed sympathy for the affected workers. British Columbia's minister of jobs, economic development, and innovation, Diana Gibson, extended her thoughts to those losing their jobs, especially during the holidays.She acknowledged that the province’s strong financial tech sector would continue to receive government support but noted that no further information about the reasons behind Bench's closure was available at this time, as reported by the Vancouver Sun.The closure has sparked a reaction from Bench’s former CEO and co-founder, Ian Crosby , who was ousted by the company's board three years ago. Crosby expressed his sadness over the company's fate and shared his perspective on the closure, which he sees as a cautionary tale for venture capitalists .“I hope the story of Bench goes on to become a warning for VCs (venture capitalists) that think they can ‘upgrade’ a company by replacing the founder. It never works,” Crosby said on social media.Crosby, a University of British Columbia Sauder Business School alumnus, recalled his battle with board members over their strategy for a “new direction” in 2021, which he believed would lead to the company’s downfall. He added that rather than continuing to fight, he chose to resign when he was replaced by a new leadership team.Kaz Nejatian, the COO of Shopify, which was an investor in Bench, also supported Crosby's view. ""Bad investors destroyed a great Canadian company by replacing the founder with so-called professionals,"" Nejatian wrote on social media, echoing Crosby's sentiments.As Bench’s sudden closure leaves many businesses scrambling for alternatives, rival bookkeeping companies such as Acuity and Better Bookkeeping have reached out to Bench's former clients, offering their services through social media campaigns.Some have even responded to complaints from former Bench customers, offering solutions for those affected by the disruption.The closure of Bench Accounting has left many small business owners grappling with the uncertainty of finding a new bookkeeping service, just as the year-end tax filing deadline approaches.","Vancouver-based bookkeeping service Bench Accounting has announced its unexpected closure.

Options expiry

MicroStrategy plan

A Bitcoin rally is fizzling in the final days of a record-breaking year for the digital asset, as investors assess the remaining impetus from President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of the cryptocurrency sector.The largest token changed hands at $96,200 as of 6 am Friday in London, partly paring a retreat of almost 3 per cent from a day earlier. Smaller rivals including Ether and Dogecoin, a favorite of the meme crowd, oscillated in tight ranges.Trump is pushing ahead with a promise to create a crypto-friendly environment in the US and has backed the idea of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. Traders are banking some of the profits sparked by the Republican’s crypto cheerleading and are waiting to see if the mooted reserve is feasible.The crypto market is also braced for the expiry of a substantial quantity of Bitcoin and Ether options contracts on Friday — one of the biggest such events in the history of digital assets, according to prime broker FalconX.The notional value of the Bitcoin contracts on the Deribit exchange — one of the largest for digital-asset derivatives — exceeds $14 billion, while the equivalent figure for Ether is about $3.8 billion.Sean McNulty, director of trading at liquidity provider Arbelos Markets, flagged the risk of a “choppy market” amid the expiry of the derivatives positions.Bitcoin is wavering even after MicroStrategy Inc. this week signaled the possibility of expanding its program of purchases of the token. The company has transformed itself from a software maker into a Bitcoin accumulator and now owns more than $40 billion of the digital asset.The original cryptocurrency is flirting with a drop for December, which would be its first monthly decline in four, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bitcoin reached a record high of $108,316 on December 17 before pulling back.Investors withdrew a net $1.5 billion from a group of one dozen US spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the four trading days through December 24, the heaviest such outflow since Trump’s victory in the US election on November 5.","The largest token changed hands at $96,200 as of 6 am Friday in London, partly paring a retreat of almost 3 per cent from a day earlier.

Wall Street rises as ‘Santa Claus Rally’ begins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-rises-as-santa-claus-rally-begins/articleshow/116645609.cms,"Equity investors are also hoping for what’s known as the “Santa Claus Rally,” in which stocks rise during the final five trading sessions of a year.

Corporate highlights:

American Airlines Group Inc said a technical vendor glitch was the cause of a brief groundstop on all US flights on Christmas Eve, one of the busiest days of the holiday travel season.

Nippon Steel Corp’s proposed $12.3 billion acquisition of US Steel Corp. moved a step closer to being blocked after a US national security panel deadlocked on its review and left the final decision with President Biden, who has repeatedly indicated his opposition to the deal.

Salesforce Inc says it’s taking multiple large customers from former partner Veeva Systems Inc. in a mounting rivalry to sell software to the pharmaceutical industry.

A Starbucks Corp barista strike has shut down about 170 cafes, according to the coffee chain, disrupting service at locations nationwide during the final days of the crucial holiday shopping season.

Arcadium Lithium Plc, a chemicals company, said it obtained all shareholder approvals for a proposed acquisition by Rio Tinto Plc.

A rally in the group that has led Wall Street ’s gains in 2024 lifted stocks in a relatively quiet session ahead of Christmas.Following a strong day for big tech, the shares continued to power ahead on Tuesday. Tesla Inc. led megacaps higher. Broadcom Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. climbed as President Joe Biden’s team launched a probe into Chinese-made chips. In a shortened pre-holiday session, the S&P 500“The action of the past few weeks shows that the big-cap tech names are still the key leadership group in today’s stock market,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak. “These big-tech names are highly overweighted in the portfolios of a huge number of institutional investors. Any buying they do over the next week is likely to be concentrated in these names.”Equity investors are also hoping for what’s known as the “Santa Claus Rally,” in which stocks rise during the final five trading sessions of a year and the first two of the new one. This time around that window started Tuesday.“Santa Claus rally could still be alive, with strong seasonality into the end of the year,” said London Stockton at Ned Davis Research.Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated average and median returns of 1.3% during this period, widely outpacing the market’s average seven-day gain of 0.3%, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.“When investors are on the ‘nice’ list, and Santa delivers a ‘positive’ Santa Claus Rallyreturn, the S&P 500 has generated an average January and forward annual return of 1.4% and 10.4%, respectively,” he said.The S&P 500 rose 1.1%. The Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%.The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.59%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index barely budged.While a positive “Santa Claus Rally” has preceded a 10.4% average annual gain for the S&P 500 since World War II, Sam Stovall at CFRA says a more accurate indicator in his view is the “January Barometer.”That’s a market hypothesis positing that January’s performance predicts the year’s performance. The term was coined by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, in 1972.Since 1945, when the year started with a gain in January, the S&P 500 rose an average of 18.3% in price during the entire year, Stovall at CFRA said. If the first month saw a decline in price, however, the average full-year return was negative 1.9%.With the market up over 25% this year and no corrections of more than 10%, the S&P 500 has managed to stay solidly above its 200-day moving average for the entirety of 2024, noted Bespoke Investment Group strategists.“Barring a significant market selloff in the last few trading days of the year, this will be the 12th year since 1952 (when we went to the current 5-day trading week at the NYSE) that the S&P has traded above its 200-DMA all year,” they said.The average next-year change following these years has been a gain of just 4.6% compared to the average gain of 9.2% for all years, Bespoke noted.Last week, Bank of America Corp. clients were large net buyers of US equities, according to strategist Jill Carey Hall. They bought American shares for the seventh consecutive week.Similar to the prior five weeks, clients bought both single stocks and exchange-traded funds, with bigger inflows into the former, she noted. Flows were primarily in large caps.Investors should have a more-balanced approach in US stocks over the first quarter, according to Citigroup Inc. strategists led by Scott Chronert, who see a greater opportunity in defensive sectors.They raised health care to overweight, noting valuations are now lower and fundamentals seem close to inflection point. Meantime, they are selective on growth stocks, looking for stronger fundamental trend versus valuation and potential margin improvement.Citi’s strategists are overweight in media, internet and semiconductors, while raising software to market weight.",The S&P 500 rose 1.1%.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Nikkei also inched higher, jumping 864 points or 1.6% to 54,413. Shenghai and Shenzhen also traded in green, up 1.11% or 1.83%.Meanwhile, in South Korea, Kospi was down 4 points, around 9 am IST.The regional performance followed a softer close on Wall Street overnight. US stocks retreated on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 pulling back from a record high. Losses were led by banking shares after JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported investment-banking fees that fell short of guidance, dragging the broader sector lower. The move came despite December inflation data, which failed to materially shift expectations that the Federal Reserve will pause further interest-rate cuts.Market participants are now positioning ahead of Wednesday, with attention focused on a possible US Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s global tariffs announced in April.At the same time, a cooler-than-expected reading in the US consumer price index strengthened bond traders’ expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold off on rate cuts until mid-year, Bloomberg reported.Investors are also tracking a heavy slate of bank earnings. After JPMorgan reported on Tuesday, results from Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are scheduled for release on Wednesday and Thursday. Collectively, the group is expected to record its second-highest annual profit on record, helped by policy changes under the Trump administration.The prospect of a Supreme Court ruling on tariffs remains a key risk. An unfavourable outcome for US President Donald Trump could trigger a negative market response, even as the administration retains alternative legal routes to enforce most of the levies.In commodities, Brent crude extended gains, posting its largest four-day rise since June as Trump intensified rhetoric around Iran.

Budget 2026 expectations for defence: Why capital outlay should be hiked for ‘Atmanirbharta’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-for-defence-why-capital-outlay-should-be-hiked-for-atmanirbharta-in-defence-drdo-operation-sindoor-4-points-to-focus-on/articleshow/126516015.cms,"Budget 2026 for defence: FICCI has advocated for higher emphasis on ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence, with modern techniques.

Defence Spending Can Fuel Growth, Says CDS Anil Chauhan As India Rethinks Guns Versus Butter Debate

Defence Budget 2026 - 4 Point Approach

FICCI notes that in Budget 2025, the Ministry of Defence was allocated Rs 6,81,210.27 crore for FY 2025–26. This was a 9.53% rise over the Budget Estimates for FY 2024–25. The industry body suggests that while the government maintains the growth of approximately 10% in the overall budgetary support for the Ministry of Defence in the coming year, the share of capital outlay should be increased to 30% from around 26% earlier. “Additional capital outlay will help in modernisation of military infrastructure, particularly for investments in frontline assets, UAVs, counter UAV systems, electronic warfare systems and air defence systems in border areas,” it says.

FICCI is of the view that the budgetary allocation for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) needs to be stepped up. Last year the budget was increased by 12.4% to Rs 26,816.82 crore in FY 2025–26. “The overall allocation for DRDO should be increased by Rs 10,000 crore in the upcoming budget. This will financially strengthen the DRDO in developing new technologies with special focus on fundamental research for frontier technologies in collaboration with private parties through flagship scheme of DRDO i.e. Technology Development Fund and will assist the development of Deep Technology in the defence sector.”

The industry body notes that under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, the government has made notable progress in defence indigenisation through setting up of Defence Industrial Corridors in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. This momentum needs to be strengthened further, says FICCI, advocating for establishing an Eastern India Defence Industrial Corridor. “Synchronising with the ‘Purvodaya Scheme’ , it would rejuvenate the industrial clusters in Eastern India and shall spur job creation, stimulate R&D, and establish India as a global hub for defence exports, while securing national interests across all three borders,” FICCI says.

Budget 2026 should also focus on giving an impetus to defence exports which have risen at a compound annual growth rate of 46% between 2016–17 and 2023–24. This has largely been driven by higher exports from private sector firms. The central government aims to achieve defence exports worth Rs 50,000 crore by 2028-29. FICCI suggests that the government considers setting up a Defence Export Promotion Council (DEPC) that can co-ordinate with armed services, their foreign directorates, DPSUs, private manufacturers, MEA, Indian embassies, and MoD and communicate with foreign governments and buyers.

Budget 2026 for defence: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s Union Budget 2026 should look to prioritise growth-enhancing productive capital expenditure, with a special focus on the defence sector at a time when the global environment is marked with uncertainty, says FICCI in its pre-Budget memorandum.According to the industry body, India needs to lay special emphasis on technology-driven defence innovation. “India’s external security environment today is marked by heightened uncertainty and rise in disputes and conflicts. India’s adversaries are investing heavily in advanced military technologies such as autonomous weapons, hypersonic systems, UAV swarms, and AI-enabled warfare, posing heightened risks. A strong, modern, and well-resourced defence architecture has thus become critical for safeguarding India’s territorial integrity and preserving strategic autonomy,” FICCI has said in its Budget 2026 wishlist.FICCI has advocated for higher emphasis on ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence, with modern techniques using artificial intelligence, and not just platform-driven enhancements.“Future warfare will be defined by technology-driven, multi-domain and information-centric operations. Conflicts will increasingly span land, air, sea, cyber, space and electromagnetic spectrum domains. For India, preparing for such challenges requires a shift from platform-centric to networked, integrated, AI-enabled capabilities backed by robust indigenous defence innovation,” it says.According to FICCI, increasing the defence budget should not just be about a budgetary choice but a strategic imperative. So what should the Union Budget 2026 for defence focus on? FICCI advocates a four-pronged approach:","In Budget 2025, the Ministry of Defence was allocated Rs 6,81,210.27 crore for FY 2025–26. FICCI has advocated for higher emphasis on ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence, with modern techniques.

Benchmark indices traded with a downward bias as investors remained cautious amid a risk-off environment. Persistent selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), coupled with escalating geopolitical tensions in regions including Venezuela, Greenland, and Iran, weighed on market sentiment. Additionally, investors are closely tracking the ongoing Q3FY26 earnings season and developments related to India–US trade negotiations. The combination of global uncertainties, geopolitical risks, and trade-related concerns led to elevated risk aversion, resulting in subdued market performance.The index traded with heightened volatility and formed a bearish candle during Wednesday’s session, marking a lower high and lower low. This price action indicates ongoing consolidation amid increased stock-specific movements, as the Q3FY26 earnings season gets underway.Nifty is currently consolidating near its 100-day exponential moving average (EMA). On the downside, Monday’s panic low of 25,473 is expected to serve as an immediate key support level. On the upside, the 25,950–26,050 zone is likely to act as immediate resistance, as it coincides with the 20-day EMA and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of last week’s decline.Overall Nifty is likely to consolidate in the range of 26000-25,500 only a breakout or a breakdown will signal the next directional moveBank Nifty continues to outperform the Nifty, displaying clear relative strength as it continues to consolidate around 60000 levels.Index during current week is seen rebounding from the lower band of the last five weeks range placed around 58700-59000. Going ahead a follow through strength above Wednesday’s high (59,796) will open upside towards the recent all time high of 60,430 levels in the coming week. Overall, we expect the index to extend the consolidation within the 58,700–60,400 range. A decisive breakout above this range or a breakdown below it will provide clarity on the next directional move.The key short-term support zone lies at 59,000–58,700.

NEW DELHI: People with job cards assigned under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Guarantee Scheme will be able to get work without disruption when transition takes place to new rural employment framework under Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Aajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act.Even though exact timeframe is not known yet, rural development ministry officials said the VB-G RAM G scheme will come into force in the coming financial year after the Centre frames and notifies the rules. After govt notifies the Act's commencement date, states will get six months to make their schemes to enable implementation of the law.To ensure there is no disruption and job guarantee is upheld during transition from MGNREGA , it has been proposed to enable workers to use the same job cards issued under MGNREGA with Aadhaar-based eKYC.The officials said that as of now, around 75% of job cards have been verified with eKYC under the ongoing scheme. Moreover, ongoing projects under MGNREGA, if incomplete when the transition happens to the new scheme, would stay on course.Meanwhile, work is on to frame rules, lay out regulations on normative allocations, fund flow plan, IT framework, a national-level steering panel and social audits.Under the new law, focus will be on transparency to weed out leakages and duplicacy of work,the social audit system will be strengthened, and technology leveraged to create systems to establish work progress, timely wage payment and accountability through 'e-measurement' books, sources said. Demand for work will have to be entered on a digital platform. Officials made it clear the new law in no way interferes with demand-driven character of the scheme.",People with job cards assigned under MGNREGA will be able to get work without disruption when transition takes place.

January brings with it a series of festivals and events, and many are wondering whether January 15 is a bank holiday or not. It is therefore advisable to check the bank holiday calendar if a branch visit is on your to-do list.Missing a holiday can quickly turn a simple bank errand into a wasted trip, especially in the early days of the year as people settle back into work and manage their finances. In India, banks observe a combination of national and regional holidays, which means closure dates can vary from state to state.Banks in many states will remain closed today, on January 15, 2026.Banks in Maharashtra will remain closed due to the election to Municipal Corporations in the state.FBanks in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh will also remain closed on the occasion of Uttarayana Punyakala, Pongal , Maghe Sankranti and Makara Sankranti.Banks in Tamil Nadu will be closed to mark Thiruvalluvar Day and Uzhavar Thirunal.Banks in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal will remain shut in observance of the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks nationwide will be closed on account of Republic Day.In addition to these, banks across the country remain closed on the second and fourth Saturdays of every month.Being aware of bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute inconvenience. While branch services are unavailable on holidays, customers can still access online banking services, ATMs, mobile banking apps and UPI for fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical branch visit, such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available. Account holders are advised to plan such activities ahead of time and make use of digital banking options during closures.","Banks in many states will remain closed today, on January 15, 2026.

Wall Street steadied on Thursday as heavyweight technology stocks bounced back on the back of strong signals from the global chip industry, while a sharp drop in crude oil prices helped soothe broader market concerns, according to an AP report.The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, snapping a two-day losing streak that followed its recent record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 140 points, or 0.3%, in early trade, while the Nasdaq composite outperformed with a 0.8% rise, led by renewed buying in Big Tech stocks.The rebound in technology shares came after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), a critical supplier to Nvidia and other global tech giants, reported quarterly profits that beat analyst expectations. The chipmaker also said it may raise capital expenditure to as much as $56 billion this year to capitalise on sustained demand from artificial intelligence applications.Nvidia, which had been one of the biggest drags on the S&P 500 a day earlier after sliding 1.4%, jumped 2.3% following TSMC’s results, easing concerns that AI-linked stocks had run too far, too fast. TSMC’s US-listed shares surged 3.7%, while ASML, a key supplier to chipmakers, rallied 6.7%.Sentiment was further supported by a sharp cooling in oil prices. US benchmark crude tumbled 4.6% to $59.04 a barrel, while Brent crude fell 4.3% to $63.69. The decline followed comments from President Donald Trump that executions in Iran may have been halted amid protests, easing fears of supply disruptions from one of the world’s key oil-producing regions.

US tariffs no bar: China’s trade surplus hits $1.2 trillion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tariffs-no-bar-chinas-trade-surplus-hits-1-2-trillion/articleshow/126536714.cms,"Bloomberg

China’s exports ended last year with a growth spurt and sent its trade surplus to a record $1.2 trillion in 2025, extending a boom that’s seen factories escape Donald Trump’s tariffs by making deeper inroads into markets beyond the US.The resilience was the biggest surprise for an ailing Chinese economy and could cushion it in the months to come. Defying expectations for a slowdown, exports picked up last month — a feat given a high base of comparison from a year ago, when Trump’s re-election to the presidency sparked panicked front-loading of orders.The 6.6% gain in Dec was the quickest in three months, official data showed on Wednesday, and faster than any forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.“We expect export resilience to extend into this year, with exports remaining an important growth driver and partially offsetting weaker domestic demand,” Barclays economists wrote in a report.The combined increase in shipments to Southeast Asia and Europe more than offset a deepening contraction in sales to the US last year.A surge in exports of highend goods shows the headway China has made in moving up the value chain, which also led to its shrinking imports for products like cars.And as supply chains shift overseas, the construction of factories elsewhere — partly driven by Chinese investment — is pushing up demand for Chinese components, equipment and machinery. The factors driving China’s booming trade and large surpluses are unlikely to fade soon.The country’s current account surplus — a measure of trade in goods and services — was projected by the International Monetary Fund at 3.3% of gross domestic product last year. That would be the highest level since 2010, when the country’s last great export upswing was tapering off following its ascension into the World Trade Organization in the early 2000s.The swelling trade surplus also underscores the imbalance between China’s manufacturing strength and stubbornly weak domestic consumption. It’s a vulnerability likely to persist into this year and beyond.While exports have powered the world’s second-biggest economy, its years-long property slump and falling investment are restraining the country’s appetite for foreign goods, reducing imports such as crude oil. Deflation at home also led to depreciation of the yuan in inflation-adjusted terms, making Chinese products more appealing elsewhere. But as China navigates tariffs and growing economic protectionism around the world, it’s stirring anxiety abroad as it pours exports into Africa, Latin America and beyond.Chinese authorities are taking steps to address the rising trade tensions, including by reducing export tax rebates for hundreds of products such as solar cells and batteries. In another sign of easing frictions, the European Union is considering a minimum price system for Chinese electric vehicles to replace import tariffs. As exports surge ever higher, the domestic implications are also far-reaching. The strength of external demand will likely weaken urgency for Chinese policymakers to boost domestic consumer spending and investment.",China's exports ended last year with a growth spurt and sent its trade surplus to a record $1.2 trillion in 2025.

‘US Is Screwed If…’: Trump Fears Supreme Court Ruling As Tariff Empire Faces Trillions In Losses

Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump

The US Supreme Court on Wednesday issued three decisions but did not deliver a verdict on the closely watched legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s global tariffs, keeping markets and governments waiting for clarity on a case with wide economic implications.As per news agency Reuters, the court did not indicate when it would rule on the tariffs dispute and, as is customary, did not announce in advance which cases would be decided on the day.The latest decision day marked the second missed opportunity for a ruling, following another session that passed without a verdict.The case is seen as a major test of presidential powers and the Supreme Court’s willingness to scrutinise Trump’s expansive claims of authority since returning to office in January 2025, reported Reuters.The outcome is expected to have a significant impact on global trade and the wider economy.At the centre of the dispute is Trump’s use of a 1977 law — the International Emergency Economic Powers Act — to impose sweeping tariffs on trade partners by declaring various national emergencies.During arguments heard in early November, both conservative and liberal justices appeared sceptical about whether the law actually authorises the imposition of tariffs, according to Reuters.The Trump administration is appealing lower court rulings that found the president had exceeded his authority.The case, formally titled, is being closely followed by businesses that have challenged the tariffs in court. As per Yahoo Finance, companies such as Costco are seeking refunds on import duties if the Supreme Court ultimately rules against the president’s actions.Trump has publicly voiced strong concerns about the potential outcome. On Monday, he wrote on social media: “If the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE’RE SCREWED!”His comments followed weeks of online posts warning that losing the power to impose tariffs would be a serious blow to the country.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters that even if the court were to strike down the tariffs — an outcome he described as unlikely — the Treasury has sufficient funds to cover any refunds.However, he questioned whether companies would pass that money back to consumers. “It won’t be a problem if we have to do it,” Bessent said, adding that businesses suing the government may not share refunds with customers.The delay comes amid broader global trade tensions. Yahoo Finance noted that China recorded a record $1.2 trillion trade surplus in 2025 despite Trump’s tariffs, with Beijing blaming the US for growing global trade imbalances.The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in the tariffs case before the end of its current session in June. Until then, uncertainty remains over the future of Trump’s tariff regime and the scope of presidential power over trade.","The US Supreme Court on Wednesday issued three decisions but did not deliver a verdict on the closely watched legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s global tariffs.

NEW DELHI: The United States has decided to freeze immigrant visa processing indefinitely for citizens of 75 countries, including Pankistan, Iran, Russia, Somalia and Afghanistan, in what is being described as one of the Trump administration’s most far-reaching immigration enforcement measures.The US State Department will suspend the immigrant visa processing beginning January 21 while it reassesses screening and vetting procedures, a person familiar with the matter said. The individual spoke on condition of anonymity as the internal department memo has not been made public.According to the memo, consular officers have been instructed to refuse visas under existing law as part of a broader effort to tighten enforcement of the “public charge” provision of US immigration law. The move is aimed at denying entry to applicants deemed likely to rely on public welfare benefits.The list of affected countries includes Pakistan, Somalia, Russia, Afghanistan, Brazil, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Nigeria, Thailand and Yemen, among others. While applicants from some of these countries already face significant hurdles in obtaining US visas, the decision is expected to come as a shock to nationals from others, including Brazil.Also read: US freezes immigrant visa processing for 75 countries: Is India, Pakistan in the list? Check the complete details The pause will remain in effect indefinitely until the State Department completes its reassessment of visa processing procedures, the report said.Somalia has drawn particular scrutiny following a major fraud investigation in Minnesota, where prosecutors uncovered widespread abuse of taxpayer-funded benefit programmes. Federal officials said many of those implicated were Somali nationals or Somali-Americans.In November 2025, the State Department sent a cable to US diplomatic posts worldwide directing consular officers to apply stricter screening standards under the public charge provision. The guidance instructs officers to deny visas to applicants considered likely to depend on public benefits, taking into account factors such as health, age, English proficiency, financial status and the potential need for long-term medical care.Under the guidance, older or overweight applicants could be denied visas, as could individuals with any past use of government cash assistance or institutional care.In a statement, State Department spokesperson Tommy Piggott said, “The State Department will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people.”“Immigration from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits,” he added.The public charge provision has existed in US immigration law for decades, though enforcement has varied widely across administrations, with consular officers traditionally given broad discretion in applying the standard.Exceptions to the visa pause will be “very limited” and will only be granted after applicants have cleared public charge considerations, according to the report.Under a 2022 version of the public charge rule implemented during the Biden administration, the scope of benefits considered was narrowed mainly to cash assistance and long-term institutional care. Programmes such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Women, Infants and Children nutrition programme, Medicaid and housing vouchers were excluded.The Immigration and Nationality Act has long allowed consular officers to deny visas on public charge grounds. In 2019, President Donald Trump expanded the definition to include a broader range of public benefits. That move was challenged in court, with parts of it blocked before being rescinded by the Biden administration.","The US State Department will suspend the immigrant visa processing beginning January 21 while it reassesses screening and vetting procedures.

US stock markets edged lower again on Wednesday as mixed earnings from major banks and a rise in oil and gold prices kept investors cautious. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 per cent, extending its decline a day after hitting an all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 84 points, or 0.2 per cent, while the Nasdaq composite was down 0.5 per cent in early trade, AP reported.Market sentiment remained fragile as crude oil prices added about 1 per cent to recent gains amid concerns that protests in Iran could disrupt global oil supplies. Gold rose nearly 1 per cent, moving closer to record levels, while Treasury yields eased as investors sought safer assets.Bank stocks weighed on the benchmarks. Wells Fargo dropped 4.5 per cent after reporting quarterly profit and revenue that missed expectations, with analysts pointing to weaker trading fees and other items. Bank of America slid 3.4 per cent despite posting stronger-than-expected profits, while Citigroup pared early gains to trade 0.3 per cent lower after its results fell short of forecasts.With equity valuations elevated, analysts said companies need to deliver solid earnings growth to justify current price levels.Consensus estimates tracked by FactSet suggest earnings per share for S&P 500 companies in the final quarter of 2025 are expected to be about 8 per cent higher than a year earlier.Energy stocks offered some support. Exxon Mobil rose 1.3 per cent, helping limit broader market losses, as US benchmark crude gained 0.8 per cent, taking its year-to-date increase to 7 per cent.In the bond market, yields edged lower following mixed economic signals. Data showed US retail spending in November exceeded expectations, a positive sign for consumer demand, though economists flagged underlying weaknesses. “Sales of big-ticket items fell from the prior year,” Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management, said.Another report showed US wholesale prices rose modestly in November, following data earlier this week that indicated consumer inflation remained above the Federal Reserve’s 2 per cent target but broadly met expectations.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury slipped to 4.15 per cent from 4.18 per cent on Tuesday, while the two-year yield eased to 3.52 per cent.Overseas markets were mixed.

US sales data: Retail sales rise 0.6% in November as holiday spending picks up; wholesale inflation stays modest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-sales-data-retail-sales-rise-0-6-in-november-as-holiday-spending-picks-up-wholesale-inflation-stays-modest/articleshow/126528982.cms,"Photo- AP

US retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.6% in November as holiday shopping gathered momentum, following a revised 0.1% decline in October, according to data released by the Commerce Department. The report was delayed by more than a month due to the 43-day federal government shutdown, AP reported.Retail sales had edged up 0.1% in September, after stronger gains of 0.6% in both July and August and a 1% rise in June, reflecting uneven but resilient consumer spending trends through much of the year.Sector-wise, sales at clothing and accessories stores increased 0.9% in November, while online retailers recorded a 0.4% rise. Sporting goods and hobby stores saw a sharper jump of 1.9%. Restaurants — the only services category included in the report — posted a 0.6% increase.The retail data emerged as about 41,000 participants from retailers, brands and technology firms gathered for the National Retail Federation’s annual convention, where concerns over high prices, the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and a weakening job market dominated discussions on the outlook for consumer demand.Industry executives said early data pointed to a solid holiday shopping season overall, though financial stress persists among lower-income households. Hiring has remained generally weak, raising concerns about consumer spending and broader economic momentum in 2026.On the inflation front, price pressures showed signs of easing. Consumer prices rose 0.3% in December from November, matching the prior month’s pace, according to the Labor Department. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, also increased 0.2%, the same as in November — a rate that, if sustained, would bring inflation closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.Many economists had expected inflation to rise more sharply as data collection normalised after last year’s shutdown, making the modest increase a relief. Manufactured goods prices were flat in December, suggesting the impact of tariffs may be waning.The National Retail Federation has projected that retail sales in November and December rose between 3.7% and 4.2% over 2024, translating into total spending of $1.01 trillion to $1.02 trillion, compared with $976.1 billion during the 2024 holiday season.Major retailers including Lululemon Athletica and Abercrombie & Fitch have indicated that holiday sales met or exceeded expectations. A clearer picture of the season’s performance is expected next month when companies such as Walmart and Target report quarterly results.On the inflation front, US wholesale prices rose a modest 0.2 per cent in November from October and were up 3 per cent year-on-year, according to the Labor Department’s producer price index (PPI), also released after delays linked to the shutdown. Excluding volatile food and energy components, core wholesale prices were flat on a monthly basis and rose 3 per cent from a year earlier.Gasoline prices climbed sharply during the month, contributing to the headline increase. The wholesale inflation data had originally been scheduled for release on December 11, with December’s PPI now set to be published on January 30.The producer price data follows signs of easing consumer inflation. The Labor Department reported earlier that consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent month-on-month in December and 2.7 per cent from a year earlier, still above the Federal Reserve’s 2 per cent target but lower than many had feared.","Retail sales had edged up 0.1% in September, after stronger gains of 0.6% in both July and August.

But under Xi Jinping's guidance, Chinese exporters responded with speed and ingenuity. Sales surged instead to Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe. In many cases, goods were routed through third countries, blunting the effect of US tariffs altogether.

‘US Is Screwed If…’: Trump Fears Supreme Court Ruling As Tariff Empire Faces Trillions In Losses

Zoom in

The surplus is not only an export story. It is also about what China is no longer buying.

Why it matters

The headline number lands at an awkward moment for Washington and its allies: Trump’s tariffs have reshaped trade routes, not reduced China’s overall export power.

US-bound shipments fell sharply after Trump escalated duties, but Chinese manufacturers responded by aggressively finding customers elsewhere, expanding sales to Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe. That pivot has largely offset losses in the American market, according to reporting by The New York Times and Reuters.

The result is a widening global imbalance. China’s surplus now exceeds one-tenth of its total economic output, supporting millions of factory jobs at home while fueling fears abroad of factory closures, layoffs and political backlash as cheaper Chinese goods flood foreign markets.

But the flip side is mounting global unease. Countries fear a flood of cheap Chinese goods hollowing out local industries. Targeted tariffs have already appeared in Europe, India, and parts of Southeast Asia, though none yet match the breadth of Trump’s approach.

The big picture

1. First: manufacturing dominance

2. Second: weak domestic demand

3. Third: currency dynamics

What they are saying

China’s stronger-than-expected export growth in December shows its export engine continued to support the economy in the final quarter of 2025 when domestic drivers weakened. Higher shipments to non-US markets again more than offset the tariff-driven slump in exports to the US. Looking ahead, export resilience is likely to extend into 2026. Eric Zhu, a Bloomberg economist

Between the lines

What’s next

China closed 2025 with a trade surplus of roughly $1.2 trillion, the largest ever recorded by any country.China’s highest-ever trade surplus is a sharp reminder that higher US tariffs under President Donald Trump have so far failed to derail Beijing’s export-led growth.Customs data released on Wednesday showed exports rising 6.6% in December from a year earlier, the fastest pace in three months and well above expectations, according to Bloomberg News. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a 3.1% increase.Imports also surprised to the upside, climbing 5.7%, leaving a $114 billion surplus for December alone - the biggest in six months and one of the highest monthly readings on record.For the full year, China’s surplus rose about 20% from 2024, breaking through the trillion-dollar mark before December and cementing a run of trade dominance unmatched by any major economy.December’s figures capture how quickly Chinese exporters adapt under pressure.Monthly trade surpluses exceeded $100 billion seven times in 2025, up from just once in 2024, Reuters reported. Export growth beat forecasts even as US-bound shipments slumped, underscoring the effectiveness of China’s market diversification strategy.Imports rebounded more than expected, but not nearly enough to offset the export surge.China has not posted a trade deficit since 1993. Even adjusted for inflation, its 2025 surplus dwarfs historical peaks elsewhere. Japan’s surplus topped out at the equivalent of about $214 billion in today’s dollars in the early 1990s, while Germany’s peaked near $364 billion after Europe’s debt crisis - both a fraction of China’s current level, the New York Times noted.China’s record surplus reflects a collision of structural forces that tariffs alone cannot easily reverse.China has spent years building scale, supply-chain depth and cost advantages across key industries - from autos and electronics to batteries, solar panels and lower-grade chips. Reuters reported that vehicle exports jumped 19.4% in 2025, with pure electric vehicle shipments surging nearly 49%, keeping China on track to remain the world’s top auto exporter for a third straight year.Imports remain constrained by a prolonged property downturn, falling investment and cautious consumers. Since a housing market crash began in 2021, many households have seen their savings evaporate, curbing demand for imported goods - and even dampening purchases of domestic products.Bloomberg noted that Beijing’s long-running industrial policies aimed at import substitution and self-reliance have further suppressed inbound trade, reinforcing the surplus.A relatively weak yuan has boosted export competitiveness. While the currency has edged up against the dollar, it lost more than 7% against the euro last year. Adjusted for deflation at home and higher inflation elsewhere, China’s real effective exchange rate -a key measure of export competitiveness - sits near its weakest level in years, according to Bloomberg.Chinese officials argue the surplus reflects resilience, not distortion.Vice customs minister Wang Jun told reporters in Beijing that trade in 2025 “surpassed 45 trillion yuan ($6.4 trillion) for the first time, setting a new historical high”. He blamed weak imports in part on foreign restrictions, saying, “Some country has politicised trade issues and limited high tech exports to China, if they hadn’t, we would have imported more.”Looking ahead, Wang said China’s market would “open more” in 2026 and would “still be an opportunity for the world.”Private-sector economists see exports continuing to do heavy lifting. “We continue to expect exports to act as a big growth driver in 2026,” Jacqueline Rong, chief China economist at BNP Paribas, told AP.International institutions are more cautious. After China’s surplus passed $1 trillion late last year, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned in Beijing that China should rely less on exports and more on domestic consumption.“As the second-largest economy in the world, China is simply too big to generate much growth from exports, and continuing to depend on export-led growth risks furthering global trade tensions,” she said.The scale of the surplus helps explain why markets have largely shrugged off Trump’s latest tariff threats.This week, Trump announced a 25% tariff on countries trading with Iran, a move that risks complicating relations with China, the world’s top buyer of Iranian oil. Bloomberg reported that the threat could undermine a one-year trade truce between Washington and Beijing.Yet stocks and bonds barely reacted. “The market does not care about Trump’s capricious tariff threats,” Vey-Sern Ling of Union Bancaire Privee told Bloomberg, adding that Trump is unlikely to jeopardize the China truce simply to pressure Iran.Behind the scenes, Beijing is also adjusting. Authorities have moved to rein in some exports to ease tensions and curb deflation driven by excess capacity. Export tax rebates on hundreds of products - including solar cells and batteries - will be scrapped starting in April, according to an official announcement cited by Bloomberg.Chinese leaders have also struck a more conciliatory tone. Premier Li Qiang recently called for “proactively expanding imports and promoting the balanced development of imports and exports,” comments reported by Reuters and seen as a signal to trading partners that Beijing recognizes the political costs of runaway surpluses.Looking into 2026, economists expect export growth to moderate but remain a central pillar of China’s economy.A high base of comparison, rising trade barriers in Europe and emerging markets, and political pressure over overcapacity could slow momentum. But strong global demand for competitively priced goods - combined with Chinese firms setting up overseas production hubs to reduce tariff exposure - is likely to keep shipments elevated.The bigger uncertainty is political. Trump’s renewed tariff threats, particularly those linked to Iran, risk reopening fault lines with Beijing. Chinese officials have warned they will take “appropriate action” if Washington violates existing trade agreements.For now, the data tell a clear story: Trump’s tariffs have bent China’s trade flows - but they haven’t broken the export machine.China has not run a trade deficit since 1993. In 2025, it pushed its surplus into territory no other economy has ever reached. The lesson of the year is blunt. However loudly tariffs are announced, China’s export engine has become adept at driving around them.(With inputs from agencies)","US-bound shipments fell sharply after Donald Trump raised duties in 2025. But under Xi Jinping's guidance, Chinese exporters responded with speed and ingenuity. Sales surged instead to Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe. In many cases, goods were routed through third countries, blunting the effect of US tariffs altogether.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126521346,imgsize-2871647,width-400,resizemode-4/126521346.jpg"

'May Not Need IMF Loans In 6 Months': Pakistan Eyes JF-17 Sales Surge To Save Economy

Trump Family-led Firm's Stablecoin Deal with Pakistan

Donald Trump’s family has just upped their stakes in Pakistan! World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture linked to US President Donald Trump’s family, has entered into an agreement with Pakistan. The development comes at a time of improving relations between Pakistan and the United States.According to a Reuters report, the deal will assess the use of World Liberty’s stablecoin for cross-border transactions. The report adds that the deal is among the first publicly disclosed partnerships between World Liberty, which is a crypto-focused financial platform launched in September 2024, and a national government.As part of the agreement, World Liberty Financial will collaborate with Pakistan’s central bank to incorporate its USD1 stablecoin into a regulated digital payments framework. This would allow the token to function alongside Pakistan’s existing digital currency systems, the Reuters report said.Further specifics of the agreement involving SC Financial Technologies, a relatively low-profile firm connected to World Liberty, were not disclosed.Pakistan is expected to formally announce the deal later on Wednesday during a visit to Islamabad by World Liberty chief executive Zach Witkoff.At the same time, Pakistan has been advancing work on digital currency initiatives as part of efforts to curb reliance on cash and enhance cross-border payment channels, particularly remittances, which are a major source of foreign exchange. In July last year, Pakistan’s central bank governor said preparations were underway for a digital currency pilot, alongside the finalisation of laws to regulate virtual assets.Stablecoins are digital assets which are generally linked to the value of the US dollar. These have grown rapidly in scale over recent years. Under President Donald Trump, the United States has rolled out federal regulations that are widely viewed as supportive of the cryptocurrency sector, while governments globally are increasingly looking at how stablecoins can be incorporated into payment mechanisms and broader financial systems.World Liberty reportedly contributed to a big jump in revenues for the Trump family’s business interests, collectively known as the Trump Organization, including earnings from overseas sources during the first half of last year.In May 2024, MGX, a state-owned investment firm based in Abu Dhabi, used the World Liberty stablecoin to acquire a $2 billion equity stake in Binance, which is the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",World Liberty Financial will collaborate with Pakistan’s central bank to incorporate its USD1 stablecoin into a regulated digital payments framework.

Trump's big credit card move! Interest to be capped at 10%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-big-credit-card-move-interest-to-be-capped-at-10-what-does-it-mean-for-americans/articleshow/126518442.cms,"How would the 10% cap impact US consumers?

US President Donald Trump recently proposed to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year, to ease affordability concerns for Americans. However the move has sparked a debate as supporters are arguing that it could save Americans billions of dollars, while critics have flagged that it may restrict access to credit for people with lower credit scores. The idea received bipartisan backing on Monday.Trump, announced the move on Truth Social last week, saying that the cap would stop Americans from being ripped off” by credit card companies. The banking industry, however, has pushed back strongly against the plan, CBS news reported.Speaking after JPMorgan Chase released its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said the proposed cap would harm both consumers and the wider economy.“Specifically, people will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most, ironically,” Barnum was quoted by CBS News as saying. “And so, that's a pretty severely negative consequence for consumers, and frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole right now.”Credit card interest rates are currently near historic highs.According to LendingTree, the average credit card rate is close to 24%, while borrowers with poor credit scores can face rates as high as 36%.Researchers at Vanderbilt University estimated in a September 2025 analysis that a 10% cap on credit card rates could save consumers around $100 billion a year in interest payments. At a 10% rate, a cardholder carrying a $5,000 balance would pay roughly $42 a month in interest, compared with about $100 a month at the current average rate, CBS reported.Despite those potential savings, some analysts and banking industry representatives argue that the cap could have unintended consequences. They say lenders may respond by limiting access to credit for low-income consumers and borrowers with weaker credit histories.“They would find it dramatically more difficult to access credit,” Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News.Such restrictions could also weigh on the broader economy. Analysts at Morgan Stanley note that credit card spending accounts for between 30% and 40% of total annual consumer spending. If subprime borrowers reduce spending due to tighter credit, overall consumer spending could fall by around 5%, potentially offsetting any boost from lower interest rates.The American Bankers Association said that a 10% cap “would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,” including payday loans or “buy now pay later” products.Tiffany Funk, co-founder and president of point.me, said that a rate cap could also reshape credit card reward programmes.“Absent that lever and potential revenue source, we would likely see banks raise annual fees dramatically, or drastically reduce the value of their points and transfer programs,” she told CBS News.However, not all experts agree that a cap would lead to widespread credit cut-offs. Shearer disputed claims that card issuers would shut out higher-risk borrowers, arguing instead that banks would likely adjust other aspects of their offerings.“The credit card business is massively profitable, so it could absorb a significant cut,” he said, adding that issuers have multiple revenue streams beyond interest charges.Companies such as Visa, Mastercard and Capital One also earn income through annual fees and interchange fees paid by merchants, which would not be affected by the proposed cap.“Claims from bank lobbyists that this would lead to account closures are greatly overstated, if not completely false,” Shearer told CBS news.High credit card rates, experts say, are driven largely by risk. Annual percentage rates on credit cards are significantly higher than those on mortgages or car loans because the debt is unsecured.“There is no underlying asset like a car or a home,” Rossman told CBS News. “The risk to lenders is they aren't going to be paid back.”Card issuers are also reluctant to cut rates because doing so would reduce profits. While the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 limits how and when issuers can raise rates and curbs certain fees, it does not impose an upper limit on interest rates.Questions also remain about whether Trump has the authority to impose such a cap.",US President Donald Trump recently proposed to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.

New record! China trade surplus hits $1.2 trillion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/new-record-china-trade-surplus-hits-1-2-trillion-whats-the-outlook-for-2026/articleshow/126517738.cms,"Chinese economy — Outlook for 2026



China registered a trade surplus of nearly $1.2 trillion in 2025, the government reported on Wednesday. The record figure comes as strong exports to international markets offset slowing shipments to the United States.According to customs data cited by AP, the country's exports rose 5.5% to $3.77 trillion last year, while imports remained steady at $2.58 trillion. The nation’s trade surplus in 2024 had stood at $992 billion.Back in December, exports rose 6.6% from the previous year in dollar terms, surpassing economists’ expectations and improving on November’s 5.9% year-on-year increase. At the same time, imports in the last month of 2025, rose 5.7% year-on-year, compared with a 1.9% increase in November.Though shipments to the United States have fallen drastically after President Donald Trump’s return to office and his escalation of the trade war with China, the decline has been largely offset by exports to South America, Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe.China’s economic growth has maintained its annual rate close to the official target of about 5%, thanks to strong exports. Other countries, meanwhile, are facing concerns about the impact of cheap imports on local industries.Last month, the head of the International Monetary Fund urged China to address economic imbalances and accelerate its shift away from export dependence by boosting domestic demand and investment.Meanwhile, a prolonged downturn in the property sector, triggered by the authorities’ crackdown on excessive borrowing and subsequent developer defaults, continues to weigh on consumer confidence and domestic spending.Despite ongoing trade friction and geopolitical tensions, experts are anticipating that this year too exports will be driving Chinese economy.“We continue to expect exports to act as a big growth driver in 2026,” said Jacqueline Rong, chief China economist at BNP Paribas.Gary Ng, senior economist at French investment bank Natixis, extimated the trade surplus to remain above $1 trillion this year and exports will grow around 3% in 2026.","China registered a trade surplus of nearly $1.2 trillion in 2025, the government reported on Wednesday.

Nvidia AI chips in China! US approves sale of H200 chips; commerce dept sets strict limitations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-ai-chips-in-china-us-approves-sale-of-h200-chips-commerce-dept-sets-strict-limitations/articleshow/126515749.cms,"Nvidia has received the green signal to export advanced artificial intelligence chips to China! The US commerce department on Tuesday, signalled a policy shift, approving the tech giant to sell its H200 chips to Beijing, under certain restrictions.The development follows an announcement by US President Donald Trump last month permitting exports of the H200, provided Nvidia can meet conditions, including showing that there is “sufficient” supply within the United States. At the same time, the department highlighted that the company’s most advanced processors will continue to be off-limits to Chinese buyers.The bureau of industry and security (BIS), which oversees export controls, said it has altered its licensing review process for the H200 and comparable chips. Instead of an automatic rejection, applications will now be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.Earlier on December 9, last year, Trump said that he reached an understanding with Chinese President Xi Jinping permitting Nvidia to sell the H200 in China, with the US government set to receive a 25% share of the revenue from those sales.However, even with the regulatory opening, the outlook for demand in China remains uncertain.Reports suggest Beijing has been urging technology firms to rely more heavily on domestically produced chips. According to The Information, Chinese officials have told some companies that approval to buy H200 chips would be granted only in specific situations, such as for university research or development laboratories, sources told AFP.The same outlet had earlier reported that Chinese authorities had asked companies to halt H200 purchases while considering whether to require firms to buy a fixed proportion of AI chips from Nvidia’s Chinese competitors.The policy change marks a clear break from the approach taken under former president Joe Biden, whose administration imposed sweeping restrictions on exports of advanced AI chips over concerns they could be used for Chinese military purposes. Democrats in Congress have since criticised the shift, calling it a serious error that could strengthen China’s military and economic position.Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang has publicly supported allowing sales of some advanced chips to China, arguing that it is important for AI systems worldwide to be built on US technology.The H200 chips are graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are essential for training AI models that underpin the generative AI surge that began with the launch of ChatGPT in 2022. Nvidia dominates the global GPU market and has become the world’s most valuable company amid intense demand and optimism surrounding AI.While the United States and China continue to compete for leadership in artificial intelligence, the H200 remains a step behind Nvidia’s latest offerings. The chips are estimated to be about 18 months behind the company’s most advanced products, which will continue to be off-limits to China.","US commerce department on Tuesday, signalled a policy shift, approving the tech giant to sell its H200 chips to Beijing, under certain restrictions.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran





THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

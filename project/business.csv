Gold price prediction today: Upside in gold rates is expected to be limited with the US-China 90-day trade truce extended and other developments on the Trump trade war front.Gold prices turned volatile as a surge seen on Friday on COMEX on news of possible tariffs on imports of one-kilogram gold bars in Switzerland, threatened more turmoil in the global bullion market. But prices retreated quickly from those record highs in the current week following the White House’s announcement to address “misinformation” surrounding potential import tariffs on gold bars. The move came amid confusion in the precious metals industry and fears that a key segment of global bullion trade could be disrupted.Additionally US & China confirmed a 90-day extension of their trade truce this week, after several rounds of “productive” negotiation. Developments in US-China trade negotiations generally trended in a positive direction in recent weeks. But recent history proved trade developments can remain prolonged this year. Moving ahead trade developments in US - India remains to be watched out while on the macro front Inflationary numbers (PPI) from India & US due remain crucial to be watched to gauge trajectory of interest rate cuts in coming months.Gold seemed to lack bullish conviction during the start of the week as traders also opted to wait for the release of the US consumer inflation figures.This crucial data earlier had played a key role in influencing expectations about the Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate-cut path. Heading into the key data risk ahead, the growing acceptance that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs in September kept the USD bulls on the defensive during the start of the week. Meanwhile traders continue to price in more than 90% possibility of a 25 bps rate cut in September.Overall the latest optimism over an extension of the US-China trade truce and the US-Russia summit aimed at ending the war in Ukraine could cap the safe-haven pair major upside warranting some caution as Spot Gold could continue to find resistance in the zone of $ 3,385 – 3,410 per oz (CMP USD 3,350/oz) on the higher side.After the release of US CPI report which remains lighter than expected not enough to provide clarity on impact of higher tariffs despite slight rise in Core CPI numbers, attention could now also shift towards Producer Price Index (PPI) report (more closely followed by US Fed) due on Thursday, along with Retail Sales & the preliminary August reading of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. These figures would be closely watched further while gold prices could witness increased volatility towards the end of the week.","Spot Gold could continue to find resistance in the zone of $ 3,385 – 3,410 per oz (CMP USD 3,350/oz) on the higher side.

US Hits India With Massive 50% Tariff as Donald Trump Retaliates Over Russian Oil Imports

Foreign investment managers display heightened scepticism towards Indian equities, reaching a two-year peak, as the rupee weakens against US tariffs, elevated share valuations and declining corporate profits diminish the appeal of Dalal Street globally.The negative sentiment towards India has led to accelerated foreign withdrawals recently, with their bearish positions in derivatives reaching the highest level since March 2023, further intensified by the 50% tariffs on Indian exports to the US.""Persistent foreign selling, along with short build-up, reflects a clear risk-off approach because of global uncertainties and domestic headwinds,"" said Sudeep Shah, vice-president and head of technical and derivative research, SBI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.However, for positive observers, the low long-short ratio presents potential opportunity. ""From a contrarian perspective, such an extremely low long-short ratio could also signal that the market is oversold in the short term,"" further said Shah. ""Any positive trigger such as easing global tensions or favourable domestic cues could lead to short covering, resulting in a sharp rebound.""Foreign investors have withdrawn nearly Rs 15,990 crore in August, following a Rs 17,740 crore withdrawal in July.In derivatives, the long-short ratio of foreign positions decreased to 8.28%, from 15% in July's third week and 36.7% at the month's start, according to SBI Securities. The long-short ratio indicates traders' positive versus negative positions in index futures.A declining ratio for FPIs' futures positions indicates increased short positions, according to experts. ""The FPI long-short ratio in index futures is indicating one of the most bearish stances in recent times, with nearly 10 shorts for every long position,"" said Ajit Mishra, senior vice president, research, Religare Broking, quoted by ET. This measure ranged between 10% and 20% in late 2024 and early 2025, during heightened pessimism.The Nifty and Sensex have continued their downward trend for six consecutive weeks, the longest such period in five years. The rupee also declined for five straight weeks, reaching 87.65 against the dollar.International investors, already concerned about Indian stocks' high valuations compared to historical averages and emerging market peers, have shown inconsistent behaviour throughout 2025. The Trump administration's additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, bringing total levies to 50%, amongst the highest globally, appears to be directing them towards alternative markets.""A number of other equity markets at this point offer better risk-reward propositions and more certainty compared to Indian equities,"" said Sham Chandak, head of institutional equities at Elios Financial Services. ""Foreign participants in our market sense that with India ending up on the wrong side of tariffs, private capex and in terms consumption is likely to grow slower than anticipated earlier,"" he added.","Foreign investors have withdrawn nearly Rs 15,990 crore in August, following a Rs 17,740 crore withdrawal in July.

Under the India-Australia ECTA, for instance, utilisation of concession is to the tune of 85% at present and Barthwal said the idea is to seek 100% utilisation.He also said the proposed export promotion mission, announced in the budget, will be in place soon and even states were chipping in to improve competitiveness and remove disabilities.The secretary also said government is working on targeting 50 countries, which account for 90% of exports, with focused strategies to diversify the destinations. A similar strategy for imports is also in the works, with agencies, such as Apeda, targeting shipments of farm products to more destinations.The moves, in the works for a few months, were released as a package on Thursday, days after the US slapped India with 25% tariffs.

Noel, 69, is the son-in-law of the late Pallonji Mistry and was nominated to the board of Tata Sons by its largest shareholder, Tata Trusts.The Mistrys own 18.4% of Tata Sons and voted in favour of the company's ordinary resolution on Noel's appointment as a director at its annual shareholder meeting on Thursday. An ordinary resolution requires a majority of the votes cast in favour of it.Owning a stake in Tata Sons since 1936, the Mistrys have been actively expressing their opinions on Tata Sons' resolutions involving business dealings.In the past, they supported Ratan Tata 's chairmanship at Tata Sons, abstained from participating in the resolution concerning N Chandrasekaran's appointment as chairman, and voted against Tata Sons' decision to convert itself from a public limited company into a private limited one.In recent years, they have been seeking to exit Tata Sons, especially after their relationship with Ratan soured in 2016, but their requests were rejected by Tata Trusts. At Thursday's shareholder meeting, Tata Trusts trustee Mehli Mistry, who is also related to Pallonji Mistry (Mehli's mother and Pallonji's wife are sisters), proposed Noel's resolution while Tata Power MD Praveer Sinha seconded it. Tata Power owns 1.65% of Tata Sons, while Tata Trusts, a collection of over a dozen foundations, hold 65%.Mehli represented Sir Ratan Tata Trust, the only foundation that carries the veto vote to prevent any resolution from being implemented. Noel was inducted into the Tata Sons board in Oct 2024 following his appointment as chairman of Tata Trusts.The Mistrys' latest move comes after Tata Trusts, at its July 28 meeting, directed Tata Sons to provide the family an exit in a bid to ensure that the company remains private. Tata Sons faces a Sept 29 RBI deadline to list itself on the bourses, a move that would automatically allow the Mistrys to exit from the holdco.

Asian stocks mostly gained on Tuesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 (.N225) hitting a fresh all-time record high after US President Donald Trump extended a tariff truce with China for another 90 days, a move that eased trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies and steadied oil prices.The Nikkei jumped as much as 2.8 per cent, or 1,162.86 points, to 42,983.34 in the afternoon before easing back slightly, surpassing its previous record of 42,426.77 set in July last year. Heavyweight shares led the charge — SoftBank Group surged 7.07 per cent, Advantest climbed 7.34 per cent, Toyota gained 3.14 per cent, and Fast Retailing advanced 4.67 per cent. Analysts at IwaiCosmo Securities cited easing tensions over US-China trade talks and speculation over imminent US interest rate cuts as key drivers of the rally.The extension, announced Monday, staves off triple-digit duties on Chinese goods and removes one immediate risk for global markets. Trump signed an executive order delaying the planned tariff hike to allow more time for negotiations, with Beijing issuing a similar statement. Without the extension, tariffs on Chinese imports could have risen from an already steep 30 per cent.According to news agency Reuters, the truce had been largely expected by investors, who have also been buoyed in recent weeks by resilient US corporate earnings and prospects of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.Japan’s Nikkei was last up around 2 per cent as markets reopened after a long weekend, lifted by tech shares and tracking global gains.Australia’s benchmark index (.AXJO) also hit a record high ahead of a central bank policy meeting widely expected to deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut, with another possible by November.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was slightly higher, while China’s blue-chip CSI300 (.CSI300) was flat and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng (.HSI) dipped 0.1 per cent in early trade.“The US-China tariff truce extension preserves the status quo for now, so no immediate implications for investment markets,” Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney, was quoted as saying by Reuters.Oil prices also edged up as the trade extension eased concerns that escalating tariffs would weaken global economic growth and crimp fuel demand. Brent crude futures rose 26 cents, or 0.39 per cent, to $66.89 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) gained 22 cents, or 0.34 per cent, to $64.18, according to Reuters.Investors are also watching the August 15 meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, aimed at negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. “Any peace deal between Russia and Ukraine would end the risk of disruption to Russian oil that has been hovering over the market,” ANZ senior commodity strategist Daniel Hynes wrote in a note, cited by Reuters.Attention in financial markets will now shift to US consumer price inflation data due later Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect July’s core CPI to rise 0.3 per cent month-on-month, faster than June’s 0.2 per cent pace. “CPI will be a key test for market tone. Softer data could give small-caps a lift, but for now, mega-caps remain firmly in control,” said Marc Velan, head of investments at Lucerne Investment Management.Money markets, according to Bloomberg, are pricing in more than two Fed rate cuts by December, with about a 90 per cent probability of a quarter-point reduction next month.However, an upside surprise in inflation could temper those expectations.","Japan’s Nikkei 225 (.N225) hit a fresh all-time record high after US President Donald Trump extended a tariff truce with China for another 90 days.

India Should Put Out That It Wont Be Intimidated by Trump's 50% Tariff, Says South Asia Expert

Why SBI has stopped Nayara transactions

Russia-backed Indian refinery Nayara Energy is faced with a fresh challenge. India’s largest public sector lender State Bank of India ( SBI ) has stopped processing international trade and forex transactions for Nayara Energy following recent US tariff hikes. The bank's decision aims to avoid any potential sanctions from the US or the European Union, a source told ET. US President Donald Trump has announced a 25% additional tariff on India for its crude oil trade with Russia.Nayara Energy was formed after the Rosneft-led purchase of Essar Oil's Vadinar refinery (20 mtpa) in August 2017. The organisation sources crude oil internationally and holds approximately 8% of India's refining capacity, which exceeds 256 MMTPA, ranking second in Asia.The company maintains a nationwide network of more than 6,500 fuel retail outlets.Also Read | Symbol of India-Russia ties takes a hard hit!

US tariffs impact: Lenders weigh MSME relief; government drafts wider export support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-tariffs-impact-lenders-weigh-msme-relief-government-drafts-wider-export-support/articleshow/123251755.cms,"AI image

Lenders are exploring ways to ease the financial pressure on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) hit hardest by the United States’ 50% duty on imports from India.According to ET, lenders are considering scrapping certain administrative charges such as processing fees, foreign exchange hedging costs and collection charges after being nudged by the government.A government official cited by ET said that industry groups and export-oriented MSMEs had raised concerns, which were passed on to banks. “Banks have said they will provide options through these immediate relief measures,” the official said.While broad cuts in interest rates are unlikely without a government-backed subvention scheme, bankers indicated they may stop charging penal interest for missed repayment deadlines to prevent accounts from turning into bad assets.“Unless there is some sort of relief package announced, banks have limited scope to drastically bring down rates or offer systemic support,” an executive director of a state-run bank was quoted as saying by ET.The government, meanwhile, is working on a broader support plan under its proposed Export Promotion Mission. Measures being considered include customised schemes for affected sectors, redirecting exports to alternative markets, and pushing products with weak export demand into the domestic market.Exporters are also being urged to build strong Indian brands to withstand the tariff shock.Industry representatives have asked that penal interest on loans be applied only once accounts become non-performing, and that collateral requirements be aligned with the level of risk.One industry official noted that banks often refuse textile machinery as collateral, hampering loan access for textile exporters. Discussions are also underway on sector-specific credit lines with relaxed collateral rules and cheaper export factoring services.Currently, factoring services in Singapore are 10–11% cheaper than those in India, prompting many exporters to use them. MSMEs, which contribute heavily to India’s exports and employ millions, are seen as the most vulnerable to the tariff impact, particularly in sectors such as textiles.Another banker cited by ET said that they are advising clients to use the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTSME), which covers loans of up to Rs 10 crore per borrower. “We are actively pursuing this and, in some cases, handholding firms to get the Udyam registration to be eligible under the guarantee scheme,” the banker said.","Lenders are exploring ways to ease the financial pressure on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) hit hardest by the United States’ 50% duty on imports from India.

Donald Trump tariffs: Indian electronics pivot as levies push diversification; new markets eyed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/donald-trump-tariffs-indian-electronics-pivot-as-levies-push-diversification-new-markets-eyed/articleshow/123251478.cms,"AI image

With the US set to impose steep new tariffs that industry executives say resemble the protectionist levies of the Great Depression era, Indian electronics exporters are scouting alternative markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.The move comes as the US, still the largest buyer of India’s electronics goods, becomes a tougher market, weighed down by tariff hikes and shifting content-origin rules. “I have been reaching out to my customers proactively. They are still issuing orders, but there are concerns about how this will pan out,” Sanjay Agarwal, managing director of Globe Capacitors, which exports about Rs 100 crore worth of materials annually to the US, was quoted as saying by ET.“I have already controlled my purchases, especially for the materials I buy only for US customers. As far as looking at alternative markets is considered, that is always on the horizon”, he added.While most electronics exports, including smartphones, currently remain exempt from both the 25% tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump and the additional 25% set to take effect from August 26, these exemptions are under review.They hinge on a US commerce department section 232 investigation mandated under the Trade Expansion Act, 1962, with findings expected in the coming weeks, according to ET.Rajoo Goel, secretary general of the Electronic Industries Association of India (ELCINA), said about 75–80% of India’s electronics exports are shielded from the new 50% tariff regime, but the remainder, including PCB assemblies, telecom gear, consumer products and power electronics, will feel the pinch. “For these products, our value addition is higher and would impact several domestic companies, including MSMEs,” Goel said, as per ET.US-bound electronics exports from India jumped 43.5% to $15.89 billion in FY25. Smartphones led the surge, accounting for $10.56 billion, up 89% from the previous year and made up 66% of all electronics exports to the US. “We are monitoring the situation closely and are looking at other markets for our products. For mobile phones, the Middle East and Africa are coming up as important destinations and for lighting, Europe is a market we are evaluating,” said an executive at an electronic manufacturing services (EMS) firm.Assembled photovoltaic cells (PVC) modules, the second-largest category, fell 32.7% to $1.81 billion in FY25 due to tighter curbs on imported units. Other exports included electronic instruments ($1.4 billion), computer hardware such as laptops ($154 million), and consumer electronics like cameras ($115 million).For the roughly $2 billion worth of electronics exports to the US beyond smartphones and PVC modules, there are ample alternative markets, according to Amrit Manwani, chairman of EMS major Sahasra Group. “Exporters should explore Europe, Australia, South East Asia, and given the geopolitical realignment, even Russia.Many firms may have to adapt and establish partial or full manufacturing in the US given its predominance as a market, if things don’t ease,” Manwani said. Another EMS executive was quoted as saying by ET that companies need to focus on “demand resilience” in addition to supply chain resilience.“Companies will have to look at other markets like the Middle East, Europe, Latin America and Africa. It is an opportunity for Indian companies to go beyond the US and deepen their presence in other countries as well,” the executive said.","US-bound electronics exports from India jumped 43.5% to $15.89 billion in FY25.

The long-term rate declined from 6.63% last week, while a year ago it averaged 6.49%, AP reported.Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, favoured by homeowners refinancing loans, also eased to 5.71% from 5.75% last week, compared with 5.66% in the June 2024 quarter, Freddie Mac said.Economists attributed the decline to a combination of market expectations and recent economic data. “Homebuyers who have been relegated to the sidelines by high financing costs got some encouragement in the past two weeks, but it remains to be seen if it’s enough to get more of them back in the game,” said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.Mortgage applications jumped 10.9% last week, largely driven by refinancing activity, which accounted for nearly 47% of all submissions and caused a 23% surge in total refi applications compared to the prior week—the strongest since April. Adjustable-rate mortgage applications rose 25% to their highest level since 2022, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported.The latest decline marks the fourth consecutive week of easing rates, bringing the average 30-year mortgage to its lowest level since October 24, when it averaged 6.54%.Mortgage pricing is influenced by the 10-year Treasury yield, which was at 4.29% midday Thursday, slightly up from 4.24% late Wednesday.The recent trend follows weaker-than-expected July US job data, which fuelled speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut its short-term interest rate next month. Analysts noted that a rate cut could stimulate the job market and broader economy but may also push inflation higher, a concern compounded by tariffs under President Trump’s policies.Economists generally expect 30-year mortgage rates to remain above 6% this year, though forecasts from Realtor.com and Fannie Mae suggest an easing to around 6.4% by year-end.The Mortgage Bankers Association reported a 10.9 per cent rise in mortgage applications last week. Most of the increase came from refinancing, which made up 47 per cent of all applications and surged 23 per cent from the previous week, marking the strongest refi week since April.

India & China Join Forces To Crush American Hegemony Amid Tariff War

US producer price inflation surged in July to its highest level since 2022, with fresh signs that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are driving up business costs, official data showed Thursday.The producer price index (PPI) jumped 0.9% month-on-month after being flat in June, according to the Department of Labor, AFP reported. The figure far exceeded the 0.2% rise forecast by Briefing.com analysts, pushing the annual PPI to 3.3%.Much of the increase came from services, which rose 1.1%—the biggest jump since March 2022—while goods costs climbed 0.7%. “The advance was broad-based in July, but more than three-quarters can be traced to services,” the Labor Department said, noting that trade services, a volatile category linked to wholesaler and retailer margins, drove much of the gain.Economists said the headline increase may be overstated by volatile components, but underlying price pressures are evident, particularly in goods exposed to tariffs. Trump’s 10% levy on most trading partners, along with steeper duties on sectors like steel and aluminium, has been squeezing margins.“Input costs for producers jumped in July as price pressures for businesses build from compounding tariff impacts,” said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide.“While businesses have assumed the majority of tariff costs increases so far, margins are being increasingly squeezed by higher costs for imported goods.”Ayers noted sharp recent price gains in steel and aluminium—both targeted with 50% levies—and in food products, which accounted for 40% of the goods price increase in July.Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, warned that “tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be beginning to wane.”For now, the effects on consumer inflation remain limited, with the consumer price index steady at 2.7% in July. But weaker-than-estimated hiring data has raised expectations of a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.Martin said the PPI figures “provide a counter-balance” to the softer employment numbers and underscore the Fed’s policy challenge. “The big picture remains that inflation is further away from the Fed’s target than the unemployment rate and is likely to climb further over the coming months. The path forward will have to traverse a tight rope between the next employment and price reports,” he added.","US producer price inflation surged in July to its highest level since 2022.

Wall Street retreated from record levels on Thursday after US government data showed wholesale inflation rose more than expected last month, dimming hopes for imminent interest rate cuts.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% from its all-time high set on Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 104 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite eased 0.1% from its record in early trading, AP reported.The US Labor Department reported that prices at the wholesale level jumped 3.3% year-on-year in July, sharply higher than economists’ forecast of 2.5%. Analysts warned the increase could signal higher consumer prices ahead as costs filter through the economy.The hotter-than-expected data prompted traders to reassess expectations for a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. CME Group data showed a 5% probability the Fed could keep rates unchanged next month, compared to near-certainty of a cut a day earlier.“This doesn’t slam the door on a September rate cut,” said Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. “But it may raise a bit of doubt.”The inflation reading came after a more encouraging consumer price update earlier in the week. Separately, weekly jobless claims fell, signalling layoffs remain low despite tighter job openings. A resilient labour market could also give the Fed less incentive to cut rates in the short term.Treasury yields rose after the data, with the 10-year yield climbing to 4.26% from 4.20%.On the corporate front, Tapestry slumped 16.9% after the Coach and Kate Spade parent warned tariffs and duties could shave $160 million off annual profit.

In response, US President Donald Trump fired Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) chief Erika McEntarfer, accusing her without evidence of manipulating the data.He has since nominated E.J. Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to lead the agency.

Bitcoin surged to a fresh all-time high in early Asian trade on Thursday, crossing $124,000 for the first time, supported by upbeat US market sentiment and policy changes favouring the cryptocurrency sector.According to AFP, the world’s largest digital asset briefly touched $124,500 before easing back, breaking its previous record set in July. The rally came on the heels of Wall Street gains, with the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both hitting new highs this week.Analysts say recent US regulatory shifts under President Donald Trump have played a central role in Bitcoin’s rise. Samer Hasn, senior market analyst at XS.com, was quoted as saying by AFP that “the crypto market is enjoying a period of highly favourable fundamentals” as Trump has rolled back restrictions that had previously discouraged banks from working with crypto firms.He added that Trump could move to “accelerate the integration of cryptocurrencies into the national financial system”, given his and his family’s growing involvement in the sector.Large institutional buyers, often called “whales”, have added further momentum, with companies like Trump’s media group and Elon Musk’s Tesla purchasing significant amounts of Bitcoin.On Wednesday evening in New York, it rose past $123,500, surpassing the July 14 peak of $123,205.12.The rally has been supported by expectations of a US interest rate cut in September after inflation data met forecasts, encouraging investors to shift capital from blue-chip stocks into riskier digital assets.Ben Kurland, CEO at DYOR, was quoted by Bloomberg as saying that moderating inflation, anticipated rate cuts and “unprecedented institutional participation through ETFs” have created a strong tailwind.He noted that, unlike previous surges, this one is being driven by structural buying from asset managers, corporates and even sovereign entities, rather than just retail speculation.","The world’s largest digital asset briefly touched $124,500 before easing back, breaking its previous record set in July.

In the US, stocks closed at record highs overnight, led by Apple and Amazon, while Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time peak.Market sentiment is being underpinned by bets that the Fed will deliver a quarter-point cut in September, with CME FedWatch data putting the probability at nearly 100%.Bloomberg quoted Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi of UBS Global Wealth Management as saying, “As the labour market continues to weaken, we think the US central bank will resume interest rate cuts next month, with 25-basis-point cuts at each meeting through January 2026 for a total of 100 basis points. ”US treasury secretary Scott Bessent has gone further, suggesting a 50 basis-point reduction could be on the table, and arguing the Fed’s benchmark rate should be at least 1.5 percentage points lower. “We could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis-point rate cut in September,” he said on Bloomberg Television.Meanwhile, oil prices edged higher, recovering from a sharp drop the previous day. Brent crude rose 28 cents, or 0.43%, to $65.91 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate added 23 cents, or 0.37%, to $62.89, according to Reuters.Prices were supported by expectations of lower US interest rates, which could boost energy demand, and geopolitical risks surrounding an upcoming meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15.Trump has warned of “very severe consequences” if Putin fails to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine during talks in Alaska on Friday. As per Reuters, analysts at Rystad Energy noted in a client report that “the uncertainty of US-Russia peace talks continues to add a bullish risk premium given Russian oil buyers could face more economic pressure.”However, gains in crude were capped by bearish signals from supply data and forecasts. US crude inventories unexpectedly rose by 3 million barrels last week, against expectations of a small draw, according to the US Energy Information Administration.In addition, the International Energy Agency forecast that global oil supply growth in 2025 and 2026 will outpace earlier projections as OPEC+ and other producers ramp up output.","Japanese stocks pulled back from record levels, while South Korea and Australia advanced.

Brazil’s Lula ‘Declares War’ On US Dollar; Demands New BRICS Currency In Big De-dollarisation Push

SAO PAULO: The Brazilian government on Wednesday unveiled a plan to support local exporters affected by a 50% tariff imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on several products from the South American nation.Dubbed ""Sovereign Brazil,"" the plan provides for a credit lifeline of 30 billion reais ($5.5 billion), among other measures.Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva described the plan, which includes a bill to be sent to Congress, as a first step to help local exporters. Congressional leaders attended Wednesday's ceremony, a first in months, in a sign of growing political support for the leftist leader in response to Trump's tariffs.Other measures announced by the Brazilian government include postponing tax charges for companies affected by U.S. tariffs, providing 5 billion reais ($930,000) in tax credits to small and medium-sized companies until the end of 2026 and expanding access to insurance against cancelled orders. The plan also incentivizes public purchases of items that could not be exported to the U.S.""We cannot be scared, nervous and anxious when there is a crisis. A crisis is for us to create new things,"" Lula said. ""In this case, what is unpleasant is that the reasons given to impose sanctions against Brazil do not exist.""Trump has directly tied the 50% tariff on many imported Brazilian goods to the judicial situation of his embattled ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest.","Dubbed ""Sovereign Brazil,"" the plan provides for a credit lifeline of 30 billion reais ($5.5 billion) President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva described the plan, which includes a bill to be sent to Congress, as a first step to help local exporters.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123289318,imgsize-130600,width-400,resizemode-4/123289318.jpg"
"Debt alarm: US national debt hits record $37 trillion, pace doubles with trillion added every five months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/debt-alarm-us-national-debt-hits-record-37-trillion-pace-doubles-with-trillion-added-every-five-months/articleshow/123285420.cms,"AI image

The US government’s gross national debt has crossed $37 trillion, setting a new record that underscores the growing strain on the country’s finances and adding to the cost pressures facing taxpayers, according to the latest Treasury Department report issued Tuesday.The milestone has arrived years earlier than pre-pandemic forecasts. In January 2020, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that gross federal debt would exceed $37 trillion only after fiscal year 2030. But the figure accelerated as the multi-year Covid-19 pandemic, starting in 2020, shut down much of the US economy, prompting heavy federal borrowing under then-President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden to stabilise the economy and support recovery.More recently, debt levels have been driven higher by additional government spending following Trump’s signing into law of Republicans’ tax cut and spending package earlier this year. CBO estimates that the law will add $4.1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.Michael Peterson, chair and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said in a statement that government borrowing pushes interest rates upward, “adding costs for everyone and reducing private sector investment.Within the federal budget, the debt crowds out important priorities and creates a damaging cycle of more borrowing, more interest costs, and even more borrowing.”Wendy Edelberg, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, noted that Congress plays a decisive role in shaping spending and revenue policies. She said the impact of the Republicans’ tax law “means that we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2026, we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2027, and it’s just going to keep going.”The Government Accountability Office has outlined several ways rising national debt affects Americans, including higher borrowing costs for mortgages and cars, lower wages as businesses invest less, and more expensive goods and services.Peterson highlighted how debt milestones are “piling up at a rapid rate.” The US reached $34 trillion in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024, and $36 trillion in November 2024. “We are now adding a trillion more to the national debt every five months,” he said, noting this is more than twice as fast as the average pace over the last 25 years.According to the Joint Economic Committee, at the current average daily growth rate, another trillion dollars will be added to the debt in about 173 days.Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement, “hopefully this milestone is enough to wake up policymakers to the reality that we need to do something, and we need to do it quickly.”","The milestone has arrived years earlier than pre-pandemic forecasts.

European stocks also rose, with Germany’s DAX up 0.7% and France’s CAC 40 adding 0.5%.On Wall Street, HanesBrands climbed 4.2% after agreeing to be acquired by Canada’s Gildan Activewear in a $2.2 billion cash-and-stock deal.Gildan’s US-listed shares surged 10.1%. Grocery chains fell after Amazon announced plans to offer same-day fresh grocery delivery in over 1,000 US cities and towns; Kroger dropped 4.5% while Amazon gained 1.2%.Cava Group slumped 16.8% after missing revenue expectations, trimming its 2025 sales outlook, and reporting flat guest traffic at established outlets. CoreWeave tumbled 13.2% after a wider-than-expected quarterly loss.The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.24% from 4.29% on Tuesday and 4.50% in mid-July, marking a significant retreat for the bond market. President Donald Trump has continued pressing for rate cuts to aid the economy, often criticising the Fed chair personally. However, Fed officials remain cautious, citing concerns that Trump’s tariffs could exacerbate inflation.A key US wholesale inflation report due Thursday is expected to show a slight pickup to 2.4% in July from 2.3% in June.","The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to a new all-time high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 259 points or 0.6%.

What is a Schengen visa ?

Single-entry visa – lets you enter the Schengen area once.





– lets you enter the Schengen area once. Multiple-entry visa – allows repeated visits while the visa is valid.





– allows repeated visits while the visa is valid. Airport transit visa – permits you to pass through the international transit area of a Schengen airport during a layover but not leave the airport.





What to check on your visa

Name: Ensure it matches your passport exactly. Even minor spelling errors or changes in name order can raise red flags with immigration officials.





Ensure it matches your exactly. Even minor spelling errors or changes in name order can raise red flags with immigration officials. Passport number: This must correspond precisely to the passport you will travel with- particularly important if you’ve renewed your passport or hold more than one.





This must correspond precisely to the passport you will travel with- particularly important if you’ve renewed your passport or hold more than one. Validity dates: You can only enter and exit the Schengen area within the specified dates. Early entry or overstaying can have serious consequences.





You can only enter and exit the Schengen area within the specified dates. Early entry or overstaying can have serious consequences. Number of entries: Check if your visa is single, double, or multiple entry. Single-entry visas prohibit re-entry once you leave the Schengen zone.





Check if your visa is single, double, or multiple entry. Single-entry visas prohibit re-entry once you leave the Schengen zone. Duration of stay: Short-stay visas generally allow up to 90 days in a 180-day period. Exceeding this could result in fines or future travel bans.





Short-stay visas generally allow up to 90 days in a 180-day period. Exceeding this could result in fines or future travel bans. Type of visa: The visa category should match your stated purpose—tourism, business, studies, or transit. Using it for another purpose could lead to entry denial.





What to do in case of error?

Travel tip:

With peak travel season under way, immigration experts are cautioning those holding Schengen visa—which permits short-term stays in 29 European countries—to double-check their documents before departure, warning that even small errors could lead to boarding refusals or denial of entry at borders.A Schengen visa is a short-term entry permit for non-EU nationals to visit countries in the Schengen area for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. It is meant for temporary stays such as tourism, business, or visiting family and friends, according to the European Commission website.There are three main types:The visa does not grant the right to work in the Schengen area and must be used within its validity dates.According to Economic Times, there certain key elements that one needs to double check if they have a Schengen visaIf there are discrepancies- whether in spelling, passport details, dates, or category—contact the issuing embassy or consulate immediately. Travelling with incorrect information could lead to legal trouble or refused entry.Keep visa and passport together at all times.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

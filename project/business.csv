According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting May 12, 2025) are Indian Oil Corporation Ltd and M&M. Let’s take a look:

Indian Oil Corporation Ltd’s 4QFY25 EBITDA was a 110% beat on est., driven by higher-than-estimated GRM (USD8/bbl) as well as marketing margins (INR5.9/lit). With tax rate coming in below est. , resultant PAT stood 5x above est. at INR72.6b. While the OMC rally may be nearing its end, near-term catalysts remain. 1Q earnings may benefit from lower LPG under-recoveries after recent ₹50/cylinder price hike, softer propane prices, higher Russian crude intake aiding GRMs, and steady marketing earnings.It is well-positioned with major refinery expansions (~17.7mmtpa) scheduled for 4QFY6–1HFY27 & plans to add 3,000–4,000 new retail outlets in FY26 to its 40,000+ network. The recent drop in crude prices below $60/bbl—the lowest since Feb’21—also provides a favourable backdrop for margins.M&M reported a better-than-expected performance in Q4, led by a strong margin beat in the FES segment (at 19.4% vs 17.3% est.).Revenue grew 24.5% YoY, and EBITDA margin expanded 180bp YoY to 14.9%, driven by improved ASPs across both the Auto and FES segments. Management remains confident of outperforming the UV industry in FY26, driven by new launches like Thar Roxx, XUV 3XO, and recent EVs. It plans to boost UV capacity to 69k/85K units in FY26/FY27, with a greenfield project for future requirements beyond FY28. We believe MM is well-placed to outperform across its core business, driven by healthy recovery in rural areas and new product launches across both UV and tractor segments. We estimate MM to post CAGR of 13%/13%/18% in revenue/EBITDA/PAT over FY25–27E.","Indian Oil Corporation Ltd’s 4QFY25 EBITDA was a 110% beat on est., driven by higher-than-estimated GRM (USD8/bbl) as well as marketing margins (INR5.9/lit) Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting May 12, 2025) are Indian Oil Corp Ltd and M&M.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121029401,imgsize-90922,width-400,resizemode-4/121029401.jpg"

Explained: Why India abstained instead of voting no on IMF Pakistan loan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explained-why-india-abstained-instead-of-voting-no-on-imf-pakistan-loan/articleshow/121039577.cms,"India abstained from voting on IMF loan package for Pakistan

Decision-making at the IMF

The IMF executive board consists of 25 directors who represent member countries or groups of countries. It handles daily operational matters, including loan approvals.

Unlike in the United Nations , where each country has one vote, IMF voting power reflects the economic size of each member. For instance, countries like the United States hold a disproportionately high voting share. Thus to simplify things, the IMF typically makes decisions by consensus.

, where each country has one vote, IMF voting power reflects the economic size of each member. For instance, countries like the United States hold a disproportionately high voting share. Thus to simplify things, the IMF typically makes decisions by consensus. In cases where a vote is required, the system does not allow a formal ""no"" vote. Directors can either vote in favor or abstain. There is no provision to vote against a loan or proposal.

Why India abstained?

India questioned the effectiveness of ongoing IMF assistance, noting that Pakistan has received support in 28 of the past 35 years including four programs in just the last five without meaningful or lasting reform.

India strongly highlighted the Pakistani military’s continued dominance in economic affairs, which undermines transparency, civilian oversight, and sustainable reform.

India firmly opposed providing funds to a country that continues to sponsor cross-border terrorism, warning that such support carries reputational risks for global institutions and undermines international norms.

NEW DELHI: India raised concerns during Friday's International Monetary Fund's Executive Board meeting regarding IMF's financial assistance to Pakistan While abstaining from voting, India said, ""Pakistan has been a prolonged borrower from the IMF, with a very poor track record of implementation and of adherence to the IMF's program conditions. ""India further highlighted that the recurring financial support has led Pakistan to amass significant debt obligations, effectively making it a 'too big to fail debtor' for the IMF.Read more: India targets Pakistan on IMF bailout package; abstains from voting over misuse of funds for terrorism Here's why India abstained to vote on Pakistan loan package according to government sources:India abstained from the recent IMF vote on approving a loan to Pakistan not due to a lack of opposition, but because IMF rules do not permit a formal “no” vote.By abstaining, India conveyed its strong dissent within the constraints of the IMF’s voting system and used the opportunity to formally record its objections. India’s key objections included:","The IMF executive board consists of 25 directors who represent member countries or groups of countries.

"India-Pakistan ceasefire, FPI stance to guide Dalal Street",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-pakistan-ceasefire-fpi-stance-to-guide-dalal-street/articleshow/121093559.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: The continuation of the ceasefire between India and Pakistan that already looks fragile, foreign fund flows, quarterly numbers from several top corporates and the trend in the US market are expected to decide the trading trend on Dalal Street in the new week, market players said.After US President Donald Trump said that India and Pakistan have announced a ceasefire post their recent conflict, market players were enthused by the prospect of a rally on Monday. However, things already look fragile with India accusing Pakistan of violating it within hours of its imposition on Friday evening. Market players said the continuation of the ceasefire would reduce volatility in the market in the new week.Trading trend by foreign funds would also have an impact on investor sentiment on Dalal Street. After remaining net buyers of domestic stocks for more than three straight weeks, on Friday foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) turned net sellers again.In case FPIs continue to be net sellers in the market, that could have a negative impact on the market and could pull down the leading indices, market players said. Along with this, the strength of the Indian rupee would also have some impact on investor sentiment, dealers said.A host of top companies are set to announce their quarterly results this week. The list includes Cipla, Lupin, Hyundai Motors, ITC Hotels and Divi's Labs. The quality of the numbers and the management commentary from these companies would have some effect on the stock market in general and on these stocks in particular.In addition to these factors, trading trend in the US markets could also have some impact on how Dalal Street treads in the new week, market players said.The week will also see inflation numbers being announced by the govt. Although these numbers are currently in the RBI's comfort zone and there are signs that these would not start moving northward in the short term, still analysts, economists and strategists would be closely tracking these numbers.Exports y-o-y data on May 15 will shed light on the health of India's external trade. Any adverse geopolitical development in Europe and West Asia could also weigh on investor sentiment, market players said.","After US President Donald Trump said that India and Pakistan have announced a ceasefire post their recent conflict, market players were enthused by the prospect of a rally on Monday.

Asian markets rally on hopes of tariff relief after US-China talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-markets-rally-on-hopes-of-tariff-relief-after-us-china-talks/articleshow/121093163.cms,"Stocks across Asia surged on Monday as investors' sentiments were boosted by signs of easing tensions between the United States and China after a weekend of high-level trade talks.Benchmark indexes in Japan and South Korea edged higher in early morning trading, while US futures pointed to a strong start on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 expected to open more than 1% higher.The Shanghai Index was trading at 3,359.52, up 17.52 points or 0.52%. Japan’s Nikkei rose 16.47 points or 0.04% to 37,519.8, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 203.88 points or 0.89% to reach 23,071.62, at 8.41 am.The boost came after meetings between US and Chinese officials in Geneva concluded on Sunday with what both sides described as meaningful progress.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said “substantial progress” had been made, while China's vice premier He Lifeng described the talks as “candid, in-depth and constructive.” Further details are expected to be released later on Monday.These were the first formal talks between Washington and Beijing since US President Donald Trump hiked tariffs on Chinese imports to a punishing 145%, prompting China to retaliate with its own steep duties of 125% on American goods, effectively halting much of the trade between the two economic giants.The deepening trade war has rattled global financial markets and raised the risk of a worldwide economic slowdown. Investors are now hopeful that the recent talks could be the first step towards rolling back some of the tariffs.Analysts at Wedbush Securities called the meeting “a positive step in the right direction,” adding that the agreement expected to be unveiled this week would likely feature “a much lower level” of tariffs at minimum.China reported last week that its exports to the US plunged 21% in April compared to a year ago, and early signs of a possible recession are starting to emerge in the United States.Although few expected any major breakthrough over the weekend, recent comments from Trump and other US officials have suggested that tariffs could come down significantly. The President last week floated a possible reduction to 80%, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said reciprocal tariffs might eventually settle around 34%.Markets will be keeping a close eye on the details of the agreement, but for now, the Geneva deal has sparked optimism.","Stocks across Asia surged on Monday as investors' sentiments were boosted by signs of easing tensions.

NEW DELHI: Punjab National Bank , the country's second-largest state-run lender, will focus on renewable energy , defence, roads, engineering, and transmission as it seeks to build upon the over Rs 1.3 lakh crore corporate loans that are in the pipeline.""We are beefing up our focus on three to four sectors in the large corporate segment. We have a very strong pipeline of over Rs 1.1 lakh crore corporate loans that were sanctioned last year but were not disbursed, and another Rs 21,000 crore were approved in April,"" PNB chief executive & MD Ashok Chandra told TOI.He said that so far, there was little impact of tariffs. ""From the corporate loan sanctions, you can see there is a lot of activity. The growth can be 15-16%. Lower interest rates will also help the offtake of corporate and retail loans ,"" he said, adding that the bank has lined up a strong retail push, apart from agriculture and MSMEs.While it looks to double its exposure to self-help groups to over Rs 20,000 crore this year, PNB is also focusing on retail loans, tapping into govt's focus and expects its Rs 8,500-crore education loan portfolio to expand significantly. Besides, it will tap into the growing demand for home loans, promising to sanction loans within 48-72 hours for projects that have received RERA approval. Lower rates are expected to be especially useful, given that PNB has lowered rates to 7.95%.A healthy growth in the retail loan segment is expected to help the bank reduce the weight of low-yielding corporate loans. In the last quarter, it shed Rs 30,000-35,000 crore of such loans from its corporate portfolio, and the plan is to reduce it by another Rs 10,000-15,000 crore.Chandra said the bank is generating a healthy flow of term deposits to meet its credit flow requirements, and the recently launched deposit schemes that come with special offers such as cancer or health cover will help it mop up current and savings account balances. Since April 13, nearly 1.8 lakh accounts were opened, raising Rs 300 crore, and the target is to open 10 lakh such accounts in three months to rake in Rs 2,000-3,000 crore in a year.","Punjab National Bank will focus on renewable energy, defence, roads, engineering, and transmission.

NEW DELHI: If it was Chile and New Zealand last week, it will be the European Union this week and the United States a few days later.India's limited set of trade negotiators are switching between countries as govt seeks to step up efforts to de-risk the country's export basket by diversifying it at a time when the US is mounting pressure on partners to accept its terms of trade.Besides, the new agreements are also focused on overcoming some of the challenges that the Indian economy is facing, such as access to critical minerals. Last week, India and Chile signed the terms of reference to negotiate a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA) to build upon the preferential pact that was signed several years ago. The new deal will cover a broader set of sectors, including digital services, investment promotion and cooperation, MSME, and critical minerals.The first round of talks with New Zealand were also held as govts on both sides are keen to wrap up negotiations in a few months. With the trade deal with the UK announced last week, the one with EU - which has been in the pipeline for nearly two decades - is also expected to move faster, especially after the commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal 's parleys with MaroS Šefcovic, the EU commissioner for trade and economic security, earlier this month.Towards the month-end, an Indian delegation will return to Washington to discuss the mother of all deals - the one with the US - which it hopes to conclude in four months or so.Between all this, however, there are some, such as the ones with Australia and Oman, which have not moved. While talks with Australia are expected to get a fillip after the elections Down Under, there is much speculation around the one with Oman. The reasons for delay of the pact, which was seen to be less complicated, are still being speculated upon with concessions on petrochemicals being seen as the main hurdle.","Last week, India and Chile signed the terms of reference to negotiate a comprehensive economic partnership agreement.

US-UK trade deal may have pointers for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-uk-trade-deal-may-have-pointers-for-india/articleshow/121093281.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Will the US go to 10% and no further? Amid negotiations for a bilateral trade deal with India, the US-UK agreement announced on Thursday pointed to the possibility of the Donald Trump administration sticking to the baseline tariff for several items and not moving to zero duty covering ""substantial trade"", as is the case under most trade agreements.While industry long suspected that zero tariffs under Trump might remain a mirage, govt officials also left it vague, refusing to comment on the indications they received during the three or four rounds of discussions they had since March.For instance, under the deal with the US, tariffs on British cars were reduced from 27.5% to 10%, although in the case of steel, the duties were removed. ""The UK is committing to increase market access for various US exports and buy more US aircraft and other products.The US will still impose a 10% tariff on most UK goods,"" UBS said in a note, adding that India and South Korea are among countries with which detailed talks have taken place.Besides, the deal is tilted in favour of the US, which lowered duties on less than 100 items, while the UK slashed levies on more than 2,500 items, said Ajay Srivastava of GTRI, a trade research body.The deal also indicates that the US is willing to settle for tariff quotas, which means lower tariffs on a specified quantity of goods, to reduce levy.So, say, 10,000 American-made automobiles may be allowed at lower duty in India. Besides, UK orders for Boeings signal that the trade deal with India too may have non-tariff top-ups.""If the UK-US deal sets the template, India can expect growing US pressure to finalise a 'mini-deal' focused on tariff cuts and key strategic commitments rather than a full FTA that may come much later. India may be asked to reduce tariffs on a basket of sensitive agricultural products, including soybeans, ethanol, apples, almonds, walnuts, raisins, avocados, spirits, many GMO products, and meat and poultry. Tariff concessions on automobiles are also expected, especially as India has already agreed to reduce duties on select UK vehicles from 100% to 10% under its recent agreement with the UK,"" said Srivastava.This could result in India agreeing to import more LNG from the US while stepping up defence and aircraft orders.","The US-UK agreement announced on Thursday pointed to the possibility of the Donald Trump administration sticking to the baseline tariff for several items.

"In a 1st for quarter, banks net Rs 1 lakh crore profit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/in-a-1st-for-quarter-banks-net-1l-cr-profit/articleshow/121093237.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: The banking sector's Q4 consolidated net profit has crossed Rs 1 lakh crore for the first time. Public sector and private banks together posted a net profit of Rs 1,00,178 crore in Q4FY25, up 9% from Rs 91,829 crore in the year-ago quarter.Bank earnings accounted for over a third of listed companies' profits, which stood at around Rs 2.93 lakh crore. This growth came despite a squeeze in net interest margins, as lending rates fell following RBI's Feb rate cut, while deposit costs stayed high. Lenders, however, offset the impact through treasury gains and recoveries from bad loans.The rate cut and RBI's liquidity infusion brought down bond yields, resulting in mark-to-market gains.As bond yields fall, the value of older bonds with higher coupons rises. Banks booked profits by selling part of their government bond holdings, either to other banks or to RBI, which conducted open market repurchases.Public sector banks benefited more from the decline in bond yields as nearly a fourth of their deposits are invested in government securities. Their Q4FY25 net profit rose 13% to Rs 49,301 crore from Rs 43,615 crore, including IDBI Bank, which, while classified as a private lender, is largely owned by LIC and the govt.Private sector banks posted a relatively modest 5.2% rise in net profit to Rs 50,877 crore from Rs 48,214 crore. These figures exclude IndusInd Bank, which is expected to take a significant earnings hit due to provisions of nearly Rs 2,000 crore on derivative losses. Analysts warn that profits could turn negative if further provisioning is needed for its microfinance book.Among PSU banks, four lenders-SBI (40%), Bank of Baroda (10.8%), Canara Bank (10.3%), Union Bank (10.1%) and PNB (9.4%)-contributed over 80% of the profits. SBI was the only PSU bank to report a decline, with net profit falling 8% to Rs 19,941 crore.In the private sector, profits were even more concentrated. HDFC Bank accounted for 37.9%, ICICI Bank 28.1%, and Axis Bank 14.7% of the total.Analysts say that the banking sector's earning growth directly corresponds to the growth in gross domestic product. While banks do face margin pressure when interest rates dip, it is usually compensated for through increased demand, an improvement in trading profits and lower provisions.","Public sector and private banks together posted a net profit of Rs 1,00,178 crore in Q4FY25.

India-UK trade deal: Why the new FTA in the series of bilateral FTAs is a joint success of trade & foreign policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-uk-trade-deal-why-the-new-fta-in-the-series-of-bilateral-ftas-is-a-joint-success-of-trade-foreign-policy/articleshow/121056370.cms,"India-UK FTA: It’s the joint success story of India’s Trade & Foreign Policy.

The recent announcement of India UK FTA is new in the series of bilateral FTAs negotiated in the recent past – starting with Australia, followed by UAE and EFTA countries (Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland). It demonstrates a very deliberate and sure-footed approach of expanding India’s FTA footprint for gaining market access for goods of Indian origin and opening new avenues of growth and international cooperation. It’s the joint success story of India’s Trade & Foreign Policy Successful negotiation of the FTA with the UK – till most recently being part of the EU, also bodes well for the progress that India will be able to make with EU FTA negotiations which have been waiting for a decisive push after the past thirteen years of negotiations.India EU FTA has been held back on issues like unconditional market access to European luxury car manufacturers at concessional rate of duty, better access to alco-beverage sector and need for data secure status for India.As is evident from the PIB press release issued on May 6, some of the long standing, contentious issues, which have been holding back the India EU negotiations have been successfully addressed in the India UK FTA.Illustratively progressive reduction in duty rates on import of completely built-up cars from the UK over a period of ten years, subject to the upper limit on the number of cars that can be imported in a year.This quota-based access to luxury or fully built up cars under the FTA is a unique solution which balances out the opposite policy pull of granting market access but without adversely impacting the domestic industry. Simultaneous reduction in duty on cars and implementing annual limits to complete built-up cars is a balanced solution.We have seen this position playing out even in case of reduction in basic customs duty rate on import of superbikes about 1600 cc of engine capacity, or in case of EV policy allowing access to a certain number of complete built up EVs subject to an investment commitment.Also, reduction in duty rates on import of whiskey was another long-standing issue which seems to be resolved not only under India UK FTA but also when India unilaterally announced reduction in the duty rate on Bourbon whiskey of US origin.All these developments are a good omen for a positive outcome in India EU FTA. EU is India’s second largest trading partner and FTA with EU would be a powerful foreign policy win for the government.The initial sound bites on the impact of India UK FTA are very encouraging but fine prints of the agreement are yet to be analyzed. Open questions are how many cars are to be allowed to be imported annually; how will the origin of such cars be established; how would the licensing and control be put in place; whether DGFT will be the nodal agency for granting and monitoring of annual quota; whether the quota will be issued on the name of company. There are many such questions which would require an answer.This newfound flexibility and decisiveness demonstrated by the government in finding win-win solutions to long pending issues is a welcome development which would open the doors of fresh economic activity which could continue to drive growth in GDP and better relationships with partner countries. And the timing of the India UK FTA can’t be better when India is also expecting to close the bilateral trade discussions with the US government. Signing of a series of new FTAs underline the success of India’s foreign policy and trade policy working together.",India UK FTA is new in the series of bilateral FTAs negotiated in the recent past.

However, the company’s revenue stood at $108.1 billion, marginally higher than last year’s $107.2 billion.“Global trade dynamics affected energy markets in the first quarter of 2025, with economic uncertainty impacting oil prices,” Aramco president and CEO Amin H Nasser said.The results were released in a stock exchange filing on Riyadh’s Tadawul market on Sunday.Aramco’s shares were trading above $6 on Thursday, down from about $8 last year, following a steady decline over the past year as oil prices have fallen. Only a small portion of Aramco is traded on the Tadawul stock exchange, while most of the company is owned by the Saudi government, which uses the profits to fund national spending and support the Al Saud royal family’s wealth.Aramco, officially the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., is the world’s sixth most valuable company with a market worth over $1.6 trillion and is regarded as a key player in shaping global oil market trends The results come as OPEC+ plans to increase oil production by 411,000 barrels per day next month, as the middle eastern economy continues to be rippled by US tariffs uncertainties.

China's consumer prices fall for third month amid ongoing economic struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-for-third-month-amid-ongoing-economic-struggles/articleshow/121056800.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

Consumer prices in China fell for the third month in April as the country grapples with sluggish spending amid a fierce trade war with the United States.The latest data, released on Saturday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), showed that the consumer price index (CPI), a crucial inflation measure, dropped by 0.1 percent year-on-year. This marks a continuation of the downward trend observed in February and March, reflecting deep-rooted challenges for the world's second-largest economy.The world’s second largest economy has been struggling with deflationary pressures in recent years, facing longstanding woes in the property and exports sector.NBS statistician Dong Lijuan commented on the figures, attributing the decline to ""international imported factors"" which have led to lower prices in certain industries.These figures come at a critical time for the Asian giant, just ahead of key economic talks between officials from China and the United States in Switzerland. The two countries have been long engaged in a tit for tat tariff situation, with the US imposing a staggering 145% duty on many imports, which may reach as high as 245% overall.President Donald Trump had hinted on Friday that tariffs could be reduced to 80 percent, though Beijing has consistently called for a full cancellation of the levies that continue to pressurise the economy.Despite these external pressures, Chinese exports managed to rise in April, with a notable shift in trade routes to Southeast Asia. Exports to countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam saw double-digit growth, compensating for a sharp drop in exports to the United States.The producer price index (PPI), another key inflation indicator. also dropped by 2.7 percent year-on-year in April, a steeper decline than March's 2.5 percent drop. This further reflected broader challenges in China's manufacturing and export sectors.""Changes in the international trade environment and a rapid decline in some international bulk commodities have affected the decline in prices in related domestic industries,"" Dong said.According to trade figures from China's customs bureau, exports to the United States saw a major decline in April. However, shipments to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam, experienced double-digit growth.Chinese policymakers have recently relaxed key monetary policy measures, in efforts to stimulate domestic economic activity. These include cuts to a major interest rate and a reduction in the reserve requirements for banks, designed to encourage more lending.","Consumer prices in China fell for the third month in April as the country grapples with sluggish spending amid a fierce trade war with the United States.

India registered a formal protest, citing Pakistan’s poor track record with IMF reforms and expressing fears of fund diversion. New Delhi abstained from the vote.“Rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism sends a dangerous message,” the finance ministry said in a statement.“It exposes funding agencies and donors to reputational risks and undermines global values.”Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the development, describing it as a “defeat of India’s high-handed tactics” and a sign of international confidence in Pakistan’s economic recovery. “Indian attempts to sabotage the IMF programme have failed,” the Pak's PMO said, accusing India of plotting “a conspiracy to divert attention” through “unilateral aggression.”The new disbursement brings total IMF funding to Pakistan under the EFF to around $2 billion. The full $7 billion package, agreed in July last year, is structured over 39 months in seven instalments, contingent on successful reforms including tax restructuring, energy sector reforms, and pricing adjustments in utilities and industries.The IMF and Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement in March on the first biannual review, which included commitments such as the introduction of a carbon levy and tariff revisions.","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday approved the immediate disbursement of $1 billion to Pakistan.

US stocks are drifting Friday as Wall Street heads toward the end of an unusually quiet week.The S&P 500 was up 0.4 percent in morning trading and on track to erase what had been a small loss for the week. This may be the first week in seven where the index at the heart of many 401(k) accounts moves by less than 1.5 per cent, after swinging sharply first on fears about President Donald Trump's trade war and then on hopes that he'll relent on some of his tariffs.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 86 points, or 0.2 per cent, as of 10 am Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6 per cent higher.The big event for the week is likely coming on Saturday, when trading will be closed in financial markets. That's when high-level US and Chinese officials will be meeting in Switzerland for their first talks since Trump launched an escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies.The fear among investors and economists is that a recession could hit if the United States doesn't reach trade deals that lower tariffs by enough and quickly enough.Trump on Friday floated the idea of bringing tariffs on Chinese imports down to 80 per cent from their current 145 per cent rate, but he said it'll be up to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who will be in Switzerland. While that would indeed be a reduction, it would still be high, and Trump's posting on social media caused a brief jolt in financial markets.Futures for US stocks sank immediately.But markets later calmed as the wait continued for what US and Chinese officials will say after their meeting.Trump also talked up the potential for more trade deals that could be on the way, following his announcement the day before on an agreement with the United Kingdom.""Many Trade Deals in the hopper, all good (GREAT!) ones!"" he said on his Truth Social network.In the meantime, the flow of earnings reports for the start of the year from companies is slowing but still moving the market.Lyft rallied 20.3 per cent after delivering a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though its revenue fell short. The company said it reached the highest weekly ridership levels in its history during the last week of March.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the chip giant known as TSMC, offered an encouraging report after saying its revenue in April leaped 48.1 per cent from a year earlier. That sent its stock that trades in the United States up 1.8 per cent.Insulet jumped 15.8 per cent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after the medical device company reported stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which sells tubeless insulin pump technology, also raised its forecast for an underlying revenue trend for the full year.They helped offset a 7.5 per cent drop for Expedia. The travel website, which owns Vrbo and Hotels.com, reported a stronger profit than analysts expected, but it also said demand was weaker than it expected during the quarter. It highlighted softer-than-expected demand in the United States, as well as a nearly 30 per cent decline in bookings from Canada to its southern neighbor.Other travel-related companies, including Hilton and Airbnb, have reported a similar softening in travel demand to the US in their recent earnings reports.In stock markets abroad, indexes were higher in Europe after finishing mixed in Asia.Stocks rose 0.4 per cent in Hong Kong but fell 0.3 per cent in Shanghai after China reported that its exports rose at a faster-than-expected 8.1 per cent annual pace in April. Exports to the United States dropped more than 20 per cent, however, as Trump's steep tariff increases took effect.

As per industry sources IAG plans to order around 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and a similar number of long-haul jets from Airbus, including the A350 and A330neo, in a carefully balanced fleet expansion.“It’s a split order,” a source told Reuters.Though the announcement was made by the US government, Lutnick held back from revealing more details, saying he would let the airlines make the announcement themselves.More details are expected when IAG releases its quarterly earnings report on Friday.This new order will add to Boeing’s existing backlog, which already includes 149 aircraft ordered by UK-based buyers, 109 from airlines and 40 from a leasing company, valued at over $12 billion before discounts.Bloomberg News reported that apart from the 30 planes, IAG could also negotiate options for further purchases.Boeing is currently working to boost production of its best-selling 737 MAX to 38 jets per month, following a turbulent year that saw quality issues and a change in leadership.This high-stakes order also comes at a time of heightened trade tensions between the US and the EU, as the union had previously threatened to impose tariffs on Boeing planes if broader negotiations with Washington failed.","The deal is expected to be led by International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, and Aer Lingus.

Imports, meanwhile, dipped slightly by 0.2% year-on-year, though they rose nearly 4% from March.Officials released these figures on Friday before scheduled discussions between the two economic powerhouses. Analysts suggest this unexpected rise reflects Beijing's strategy to redirect trade towards Southeast Asian nations to counter US tariffs reaching 145 percent imposed by President Donald Trump.Commercial activity between these leading economies has declined following Trump's implementation of tariffs, some reaching 245 percent, whilst China countered with 125 percent duties and additional measures.The April year-on-year export growth of 8.1 percent significantly exceeded Bloomberg analysts' predictions of 2.0 percent.Chinese customs data revealed substantial increases in exports to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, indicating a significant shift in trade patterns.""The global supply chain is being rerouted in real time,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management wrote in a note.""Vietnam looks set to become China's offshore escape hatch for US-facing goods,"" he said.""The manufacturing juggernaut is diverting flow wherever the tariff pain isn't.""US-bound exports decreased by 17.6 percent month-on-month.Financial markets have fluctuated since the White House initiated its tariff strategy, aimed at revitalising US manufacturing.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

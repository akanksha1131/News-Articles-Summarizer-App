Flexibility in Tax Regime Selection for Salary TDS

Income Tax Filing FY 2024-25 : Employers are currently requesting salaried employees to provide documentation of tax-saving investments and expenses if they wish to reduce their tax liability. These documents are essential to prevent complete tax deduction at source (TDS) from the salary.Most employees typically have until March to provide tax-saving documentation, however it is beneficial to submit them promptly. Until documentation is provided, employers will deduct the full tax amount from salary without considering any tax-saving investments. Tax specialists indicate that not every employee needs to submit investment documentation.Regarding who must provide investment proof to avoid complete salary taxation, Prakash Hegde, a practising Chartered Accountant, told ET, ""The employees who have opted for the old tax regime are required to submit investment proofs to their employers to claim exemptions and deductions via their employer. The employees who have opted for the new tax regime need not have to submit any proof for exemption and deductions as most of them are not available in the new tax regime.""The Income Tax Act, 1961's old tax regime provides various tax exemptions and deductions that individuals can claim to decrease their gross taxable income.

""We see the EV business as a marathon, and not a sprint,"" Gupta said.Currently, the share of electrics in scooters is 15%, while it is 5% in overall two-wheeler market due to near-negligible sales in motorcycles. Hero Moto had launched electric vehicles under the 'Vida' brand in Oct 2022, but has been relatively slow in expanding sales when compared to rivals.In 2024, Ola Electric led the segment with sales of 4 lakh units, according to numbers released by dealers body FADA. TVS Motor followed with sales of 2.2 lakh, Bajaj Auto with 1.9 lakh units, and Hero Moto with 43,695 units. The silver lining for Hero has been Ather, the electric start-up where it holds majority control. Ather sold 1.26 lakh units in 2024.""I don't think we should make out anything with the current numbers. Three months back there was another player which was the number one. Right before that, there was another player, now there's another player. And this Russian roulette will continue for some more time till the category becomes sizeable. So, you start measuring the winners and losers once the category becomes sizeable... because this will keep changing, the game will keep changing.""He said that while electrics will grow faster in scooters, it will be slow to pick in motorcycles. ""In motorcycles, we estimate that share of electrics will be around 10% by 2030. They need more power and longer range, which necessitates a bigger battery, thus making the vehicles heavier and costlier. It does become unviable at least for commuter bikes.""Hero has also started to collaborate with Ather in areas like shared charging ecosystem. It also looks at newer areas for joint initiatives. Gupta refused to divulge details, but said ""many possibilities of cooperation"" are being looked into.

In contrast, electronics shipments jumped 35% to a two-year high of $3.6 billion, while readymade garments too saw a 13% rise to almost $1.5 billion.Commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal told reporters that Indian exports had shown resilience, especially non-oil shipments and underlined that India was not a petroleum exporter. He added that the schemes of govt and the efforts of exporters have helped India perform better than several of its peers in a challenging global environment. Barthwal said that India was on course to achieve goods and services exports of over $800 billion during the current financial year.On the services front, exports during Dec were estimated to have increased 3.5% to $32.7 billion, while imports rose 12% to $17.5 billion. Barthwal said govt is working on a strategy to boost exports of goods and services to 20 top markets that account for nearly 60% of India's exports.

FMCG companies woo rural market as urban slows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fmcg-companies-woo-rural-market-as-urban-slows/articleshow/117276219.cms,"MUMBAI: All roads lead to hinterlands for FMCG companies as consumption in rural India has been growing faster than in urban in recent quarters, helped in parts by bountiful monsoons which boosted household incomes.Fast-moving consumer goods companies are widening their rural distribution network, launching affordable pack sizes and pushing low unit packs of premium products to cater to rural consumers who seek better choices.ITC, for instance, is offering its premium dark fantasy cookies in smaller Rs 10 packs in rural markets where consumption of biscuits and snacks, an otherwise urban centric category is growing. ""We are offering a wide-range of our food portfolio in the rural market including our premium range at specific unit points to drive consumption-led growth,"" Shuvadip Banerjee, chief digital marketing officer at ITC told TOI.Zydus Wellness, which makes products like Complan and Glucon-D, is focusing on expanding its rural coverage where penetration of brands has always trailed urban and there is room for growth, said CEO Tarun Arora.Besides, the strategy will be to push more of Rs 10 and Rs 15 price packs in the markets where there is an increasing demand for such packs. ""For our talcum powder, Rs 10 packs have played an important role in growth. Aspirations of rural consumers match that of urban. It's just that rural households tend to buy more accessible lower unit pack,"" said Arora.Due to high commodity inflation, offering Rs 5 price packs in general have become unsustainable in many categories. ""Although inflation has impacted all price points, the sweet spot in low unit packs is moving towards Rs 10 category in my opinion,"" said Arora. Rs 50 and Rs 100 price packs are the other segments that tend to do well in rural markets, said industry executives.Rural consumption of FMCG products grew at more than double the pace of urban in the Sept quarter where the middle class have curtailed spending due to high food inflation. Rural consumption grew 6% during the quarter while urban lagged at 2.8%, data released by NielsenIQ had showed.

US core inflation eases for first time in six months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-core-inflation-eases-for-first-time-in-six-months/articleshow/117270847.cms,"PCE Prices



US consumer prices rose in December by less than forecast after months of faster underlying inflation persuaded the Federal Reserve to signal a pause in interest-rate cuts.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — increased 0.2% after rising 0.3% four straight months, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Wednesday. Cheaper hotel stays, a smaller advance in medical care services and relatively tame rent increases helped restrain the December figure.While the easing in the CPI is welcome, Fed officials would need to see a series of subdued readings after months of elevated prints to reassure them that inflation progress has resumed. Lingering price pressures have contributed to a deep selloff in global bond markets and fueled concerns that the Fed eased policy too quickly at the end of last year.Combined with last week’s strong jobs report, policymakers are widely expected to leave rates unchanged at their meeting later this month, and traders generally don’t see another cut until later this year.Treasury yields slid and S&P 500 index futures rose while the dollar declined after the CPI data.Economists see the core gauge as a better indicator of the underlying inflation trend than the overall CPI that includes often-volatile food and energy costs. The headline measure rose 0.4% from the prior month, with over 40% of the advance due to energy.This is the last inflation report of President Joe Biden’s tenure, an administration dogged by high prices coming out of the pandemic that surged a cumulative 20% while he was in office. Donald Trump will be sworn in next week, and economists generally anticipate his policies — particularly on tariffs — will put upward pressure on inflation, and measures of consumers’ expectations have been rising recently as well.The advance in the CPI was also led by food prices, airfares, new and used cars, auto insurance and medical care. Goods costs excluding food and energy rose a smaller 0.1% after a 0.3% November increase. Also taking out used cars, goods prices fell.Shelter prices, the largest category within services, climbed 0.3% in December for a second month. Owners’ equivalent rent as well as rent of primary residence — subsets of shelter — both ticked up following the smallest gains since 2021.Excluding housing and energy, service prices rose 0.2%, the smallest increase since July, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the overall inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure — known as the personal consumption expenditures price index — doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI, which is one reason why it’s trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target. Several categories that feed through to the PCE from the producer price index, a measure of wholesale inflation that was released Tuesday, were mostly tame. However, the PPI’s gauge of airfares picked up notably.Policymakers also pay close attention to wage growth, as it can help inform expectations for consumer spending — the main engine of the economy. A separate report Wednesday that combines the inflation figures with recent wage data showed real hourly earnings grew 1% from a year ago, the smallest annual advance since July.While data on retail sales, inflation expectations and the housing market will be released in the next two weeks, this is the last major economic report Fed officials will see before their Jan. 28-29 meeting.Recent speeches and forecasts have indicated policymakers are still wary of upside risks to inflation and that they prefer a cautious approach to adjusting rates.","Consumer prices rose in December by less than forecast after months of faster underlying inflation.

Understandable Due to Economic Pressures Concerned About Job Security

Meta , the parent company of Facebook , Instagram, and WhatsApp, is set to lay off approximately 3,600 employees identified as low performers, according to an internal memo first reported by Bloomberg. CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed the move in the memo, describing it as a strategy to “raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster.”The layoffs, affecting about 5% of Meta’s 72,400-strong workforce as of September, are part of what Zuckerberg called an “intense year” for the company. Employees in the United States will be notified of their status by February 10, with international employees to be informed later, AFP reported.“We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year,” Zuckerberg stated, “but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.” He noted that some employees who underperformed in the last period may be retained if there is optimism about their future contributions. Those laid off will receive “generous severance,” the CEO added.The company plans to replace the outgoing employees with new hires later this year.This is not Meta’s first wave of job cuts. The company laid off over 11,000 employees in November 2022 and cut an additional 10,000 jobs in subsequent months.The announcement follows a series of policy shifts at Meta, including the elimination of its US fact-checking program, which had been criticised by conservatives as censorship. Zuckerberg also unveiled changes to content moderation policies, easing restrictions on divisive topics such as immigration and gender while loosening rules on hate speech.Last week, Meta also announced reductions to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) team and scaled back related programs. The policy changes have drawn praise from Republican figures and criticism from Democrats, with some accusing Zuckerberg of aligning with conservative ideas ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20.Meanwhile, Zuckerberg speaking on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast last week, revealed that Meta and other leading tech companies are developing AI systems capable of handling complex coding tasks currently performed by human engineers.He announced plans to replace midlevel software engineers with artificial intelligence by 2025, signaling a major shift in how the tech giant approaches software development.Meta’s shares fell Tuesday following the layoff news, reflecting investor concerns over the company's broader direction.","Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is set to lay off approximately 3,600 employees identified as low performers.

Subtle or just the same?

Walmart ’s new logo refresh, the first in 17 years, is drawing widespread attention online, though perhaps not the kind the retail giant was hoping for. The changes, described by the company as a modernization rooted in tradition, feature a thicker font, a deeper blue background, and a “more energised” yellow spark icon.Despite Walmart’s framing of the update as a reflection of its evolution, many social media users have responded with disbelief over what they perceive as minimal changes.“Walmart just unveiled their new logo. It looks the f***ing same,” one person tweeted, summing up the sentiments of many.Another user sarcastically observed, “Oh wow I now feel the urge to spend a million dollars at Walmart.”The refreshed design, inspired by typefaces used in Walmart’s earlier branding, was meant to modernize its visual identity while keeping it familiar to loyal customers. However, the subtlety was lost on some online observers.“Walmart unveils their new logo. Is this a joke? It looks exactly the same 🤦🏼‍♀️,” one post read. Another quipped, “If you've ever been a third-grade girl, you know the difference — the old one is a sun, and the new one is a flower 😁.”Some users questioned the necessity of the changes. ""Walmart re-did their logo. This is the before and after. I can't believe someone got paid for this,"" one user posted alongside comparison images of the old and new designs. Another quipped, ""WALMART CHANGES LOGO. Finds more boring look. Can you tell which is old and which is new?""Meanwhile, some resorted to memes to describe the situation.Despite the criticism, Walmart executives maintain that the refresh is not a drastic rebrand but rather a thoughtful update meant to reflect the company’s status as a digital-first, omnichannel retailer.“This update demonstrates our evolving capabilities and commitment to serve customers of today and tomorrow,” William White, Walmart US’s chief marketing officer, said when unveiling the logo.While big brands often spend considerable time and money on subtle logo tweaks, public reaction isn’t always warm.","Walmart's new logo is the first in 17 years.

China discusses sale of TikTok US to Elon Musk as one possible option,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-discusses-sale-of-tiktok-us-to-elon-musk-as-one-possible-option/articleshow/117219501.cms,"Musk thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. (AI image for representation only.)

Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd, the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on January 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump ’s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.A potential high-profile deal with one of Trump’s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump’s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.Under one scenario that’s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk’s X — the former Twitter — would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X’s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It’s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It’s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. “In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,” he wrote on X. “Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.”ByteDance and TikTok representatives didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China’s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok’s future, also didn’t respond to requests for comment.The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok’s fate may no longer be in ByteDance’s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.The Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company’s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing’s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok’s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.TikTok’s US operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That’s a substantial sum even for the world’s richest person. It’s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc business, the person added.ByteDance’s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok’s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution’s First Amendment.A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban — which takes effect Jan. 19 — so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to “save” the app and there’s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.On a practical level, spinning off TikTok’s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be “extraordinarily difficult.”It’s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O’Leary has said he discussed with Trump. In the past, Microsoft Corp. had sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company.One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app — with different branding — to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It’s not clear how effective such a move would be.One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world’s richest person with businesses that straddle the world’s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company’s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.","Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban.

This could already be happening, with ship-tracking agencies recently reporting a gradual increase in the share of Middle-East shipments. But that could be partly because of razor-thin discounts on Russian crude amid low oil prices and Moscow curtailing exports as its refineries increase run rate to meet heightened winter demand for products at home.","Global oil price continued their rally to jump past $81 per barrel on Monday - the highest since Aug 2024.

Chinese trade surplus soars to $1 trillion on pre-Trump exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-trade-surplus-soars-to-1-trillion-on-pre-trump-exports/articleshow/117189744.cms,"A truck loaded with vehicles moves to lines of vehicles for export at a port in Yantai in eastern China's Shandong province.

What Bloomberg economics says...

“Looking ahead to the coming months, we expect the tariff-driven front-loading will continue to boost exports, similar to the trend seen during the first

US-China trade war

.”

David Qu, economist

China’s trade surplus soared last year to a record as companies rushed to get goods out the door to make up for sluggish demand at home and ahead of the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House.The surplus was an unprecedented $992 billion in 2024, according to a statement from the customs administration on Monday. That was 21% higher than the previous year and was driven by record exports and weak imports.The value of shipments rose almost every month last year, pushing it above the 2022 highs during the pandemic. Strong demand from overseas has helped provide growth for a domestic economy that has struggled due to a continuing housing crisis and weak consumption, although that support now faces external challenges.Exports rose almost 11% to $336 billion in December, the second-highest month on record and behind only December 2021, when Chinese firms saw a surge of pandemic-led demand. Outbound shipments for the whole of last year were worth $3.6 trillion.Imports rose 1% last month and 1.1% for the whole year.This may be one of the last high points for Chinese trade, at least directly with the US, with Trump promising to impose even higher tariffs on Chinese goods when he takes office next week. Punitive levies may push Chinese firms to divert their exports, flooding other markets with cheap goods and widening trade tensions.“Exporters likely anticipated potential trade war to happen in 2025 and pushed delivery to avoid higher tariff down the road,” said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. “The key issue to watch is the policies from Washington DC in coming weeks, and the policy reactions from Beijing.”Exports to the US rose to the highest in more than two years in December, hitting almost $49 billion and taking the total for the year to $525 billion.Despite shipping record amounts of goods, Chinese exporters have been getting less money for their products, with export prices falling for more than a year as deflation inside China worsens and pushes down the cost of goods. The result is that the growth in the volume of Chinese trade has outpaced value, with total export volumes rising 7.3% through November according to the Ministry of Transport, faster than the 5.4% rise in values.That can be seen in Shanghai port, which last year became the first anywhere in the world to handle the equivalent of more than 50 million 20-foot shipping containers. The port processed 51.5 million boxes last year, almost 5% more than in 2023 and 19% more than in 2019, the year before the pandemic.",China’s trade surplus soared last year to a record as companies rushed to get goods out the door.

Wage gains



The US economy in December added the most jobs since March and the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell, capping a surprisingly strong year and supporting the case for a pause in Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts.Nonfarm payrolls increased 256,000, exceeding all but one forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, while average hourly earnings rose 0.3% from November, a Bureau of Labor Statistics report showed Friday.Treasury yields and the dollar surged and S&P 500 futures sank following the release as traders pushed back expectations for another reduction to later in the year.Friday’s report confirms the labor market held up last year despite high borrowing costs, lingering inflation and political uncertainty. While demand for workers moderated and the unemployment rate rose in 2024, the economy still added 2.2 million jobs — below the 3 million increase in 2023 but above the 2 million created in 2019.The Fed’s focus has returned firmly to inflation following an upturn in recent months, with several officials signaling they may hold rates steady for a while after lowering borrowing costs by a full percentage point in 2024. The BLS will publish monthly data on consumer prices on Jan. 15.December’s advance in payrolls was led by health care and social assistance, retail trade and leisure and hospitality. Government payrolls also advanced. Manufacturing and wholesale trade posted declines.The participation rate — the share of the population that is working or looking for work — was unchanged at 62.5%. The rate for workers of ages 25-54, also known as prime-age workers, was also unchanged.The figures also showed fewer people permanently lost their jobs and more workers left positions voluntarily, while the median duration of unemployment ticked lower.Central bankers are paying close attention to how labor supply and demand dynamics are impacting wage gains. Friday’s report showed average hourly earnings increased 3.9% from a year ago. Earnings for nonsupervisory employees, who make up the majority of workers, advanced 0.2% from November and 3.8% from a year earlier, marking the slowest annual pace since mid-2021.The jobs report is comprised of two surveys — one of businesses and the other of households. The data incorporated annual revisions to the household survey, which is used to produce statistics like the unemployment and participation rates. Those revisions didn’t change the overall picture of the labor market. Benchmark revisions to the business survey are due next month.Though data on weekly filings for unemployment insurance suggest layoffs remained subdued in 2024, several big-name companies including BlackRock Inc. and Tyson Foods Inc. have revealed plans to reduce headcount this year. In 2024, companies announced the fewest hires in almost a decade, according to a report from executive-coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.It also remains to be seen how President-elect Donald Trump’s economic agenda — particularly plans for mass deportations and punitive tariffs on imported goods — will impact the labor market.","Nonfarm payrolls increased 256,000, exceeding all but one forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

"US economy likely added 153,000 jobs last month, returning to normal after strike and hurricanes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-likely-added-153000-jobs-last-month-returning-to-normal-after-strike-and-hurricanes/articleshow/117114666.cms,"WASHINGTON: Getting a clear view of the US job market hasn't been easy the past few months.Hurricanes and a big strike at Boeing threw off the October jobs numbers, pushing them down and setting up a payback rebound in November that likely exaggerated the strength of hiring.The December jobs numbers, out Friday from the Labor Department, are expected to deliver a more accurate reading of where things stand. Most economists expect them to show that hiring is solid but slowing, especially compared to the boom days of 2021-2023. Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet expect that U.S. payrolls grew by 153,000 last month, compared to 227,000 in November and a mere 36,000 in strike- and hurricane-hit OctoberBoston College economist Brian Bethune is slightly more optimistic about last month's hiring. He's expecting 165,000 to 175,000 new jobs in December - a number, he says, that would be seen by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as striking a Goldilocks balance, not hot enough to inflame worries about inflation, not cold enough to suggest the economy is sputtering. ""If we got a number in that range, he'd put his feet up on the desk and probably have a good bourbon,'' Bethune said.If the forecasters are right about December hiring, the American economy generated about 2.1 million jobs last year, not bad but down from 3 million in 2023, 4.5 million in 2022 and a record 7.2 million in 2021 as the economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns and massive layoffs in 2020. The unemployment rate is forecast to have remained at a low 4.2% in December.Over the past few years, the economy and the job market have shown surprising resilience. Responding to inflation that hit a four-decade high two and a half years ago, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate - the fed funds rate -- 11 times in 2022 and 2023, taking it to the highest level in more than two decades.The higher borrowing costs were widely expected to cause a recession but didn't. Companies kept hiring, consumers kept spending, and the economy kept rolling along. In fact, U.S. gross domestic product - the nation's output of goods and services -- has expanded at a robust annual pace of 3% or more in four of the last five quarters.American workers enjoy unusual job security. Layoffs are running below the pre-pandemic trend. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that just 211,000 people applied for unemployment benefits last week, the fewest in nearly a year.Inflation has come down, too, from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.7% in November. The drop in year-over-year price increases gave the Fed enough confidence to cut rates three times in the last four months of 2024.But Fed officials signaled at their December meeting that they planned to be more cautious about rate cuts this year. They now project just two rate reductions in 2025, down from the four they envisioned back in September. Progress against inflation has stalled in recent months, and it remains stuck above the Fed's 2% target.Friday's job report is expected to show that average hourly wages rose 0.3% last month from November and 4% from December 2023, according to the FactSet survey. The Fed sometimes frets that wage gains will fuel inflation as companies try to pass along higher labor costs to customers by raising prices.But Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a commentary that current wage growth is consistent with the Fed's inflation goals. That is partly because strong gains in U.S. productivity allow companies to pay their workers more and earn fatter profits without having to raise prices. ""Earnings growth won't give the Fed any headaches,"" Vanden Houten wrote.","The December jobs numbers are expected to deliver a more accurate reading of where things stand.

However, the data suggests these initiatives have yet to significantly impact the world's second-largest economy.The whole of 2024 saw flat prices, reflecting the previous year's performance.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

Gold and silver price prediction today: Gold prices MCX Gold is currently exhibiting a strong and sustained uptrend, supported by clear technical evidence on the charts. The price action continues to form higher highs and higher lows, which is a classic indication of bullish momentum. This consistent pattern suggests that the uptrend is likely to persist in the near term.The key support level to watch is around 112,000, which has acted as a reliable floor for prices during recent pullbacks. This level is crucial because it provides traders with a benchmark for risk management—any decisive break below this zone could indicate a potential pause or reversal in the trend.On the upside, the next targets are in the range of 115,500 to 116,000. Given the current bullish structure, these levels are achievable, provided the momentum sustains. Volume patterns and momentum indicators further reinforce this positive bias, pointing to strong buying interest in the market.Overall, the outlook for MCX Gold remains constructive. Traders and investors should monitor support levels closely while keeping an eye on any signs of exhaustion or reversal. For now, maintaining long positions with appropriate stops around 112,000 appears to be a prudent strategy.MCX Silver is currently in a stealth uptrend, quietly building momentum similar to the ongoing rally in MCX Gold. Despite its relatively subdued movement compared to Gold, Silver is showing strong underlying strength, suggesting that the bullish phase is likely to continue in the near term.The price action is well-supported around the 133,000 level, which has acted as a firm base during recent consolidations. This key support zone provides a critical floor for traders to manage downside risk and confirms that buyers are stepping in consistently at this level.On the upside, Silver has the potential to soar towards the 138,000 level, marking the next significant resistance zone. The gradual but steady formation of higher lows indicates sustained buying interest, which could propel prices upward once momentum picks up further.Given the close correlation between Gold and Silver, the positive trend in Gold reinforces the bullish outlook for Silver. Technical indicators and volume patterns also suggest accumulation, pointing to a possible acceleration in the rally.In summary, MCX Silver remains well-positioned in an emerging uptrend. Traders are advised to watch for dips near 133,000 as potential entry points, aiming for a target near 138,000 while maintaining disciplined risk management.","Gold prices are likely to continue their strong bullish momentum, and silver too will maintain its stealth trend, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

H-1B visa holders: Germany, UK, Canada look for talent

NEW DELHI: A new study has estimated India's logistics cost at 8% of GDP , with smaller firms having a higher burden.In 2023-24, for entities with turnover of up to Rs 5 crore, the cost added up to 16% of their output while it was pegged at 7.6% in the case of companies with turnover of Rs 250 crore or more. Logistics costs were estimated at 9.1% of non-services output in India.""The estimates derived for the previous five years show that the pace of growth in the logistics cost is gradually slowing down compared with the pace of growth in non-services output,"" said the study by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade done by NCAER.

This share is significant in the transport equipment sector at 21.4% of total output, followed by textiles and apparel, agricultural products, and pharmaceuticals.It estimated the per tonne per km to be the lowest in the case of coastal ships at Rs 1.80.","In 2023-24, for entities with turnover of up to Rs 5 crore, the cost added up to 16% of their output.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices snapped its three weeks winning streak and is trading with a downward bias during the current week as investor sentiment remained cautious amid concerns over currency depreciation, foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows, and global policy uncertainties. I.T counters underperformed, pressured by H-1B fee escalation, while ongoing US trade frictions and softening global macros weighed on risk appetite.A notable technical development is that the index is undergoing a healthy mean-reverting pullback over the past six sessions, which has dragged the Nifty towards its 50-day EMA, coinciding with a 50% Fibonacci retracement of the prior impulsive up move from 24,405 to 25,448. This corrective phase has also resulted in the daily stochastic oscillator slipping into oversold territory, currently printing a reading of 11 — a potential precursor to a reversal. However, from a trend confirmation standpoint, the emergence of a bullish reversal structure — specifically, a higher high and higher low formation on the daily chart — would be essential to validate a short-term bottom and indicate a pause in the ongoing corrective phase.Despite the ongoing pullback, we maintain an overall positive bias and view the current decline as a buying opportunity.In the broader structure the Nifty has already taken 13 weeks to retrace just 38.2% of its preceding 12 weeks rally (21744-25669). A shallow retracement signals overall strength.Nifty is currently placed around the immediate support area of 24,900, being the presence of the 50-day EMA and key retracement area. Index sustaining below the immediate support area of 24,900 will signal extension of the decline towards the major support zone of 24,700 being the confluence of the 100 days EMA, 61,8% retracement of the preceding up move (24405-25448) and the price parity of the previous decline, which we do not expect to breach in the short term.On the higher side immediate resistance is placed at 25,200 levels while key resistance from a short term perspective is placed at 25,500-25,600 levels.Bank Nifty is forming a bearish candle in the weekly chart which is enclosed inside the previous week price range. The index appears to be unwinding its overbought conditions following a sharp 2,300-point rally over the past three weeks. The index in the process retraced 38.2% of its precious up move (53562 – 55835).We expect the index to continue consolidating within the 54,700–56,000 range in the near term. Immediate support is seen at 54,700–54,900, which aligns with last week’s low and the 20-day EMA. A more significant support level is placed near 54,000, representing a key retracement level of the recent rally.Our broader view remains positive, and we believe the current consolidation phase offers a buying opportunity within the ongoing uptrend. On the upside, the index faces initial resistance near the 56,000 mark. A decisive breakout above this level could pave the way for a fresh uptrend, potentially targeting the 57,000 level in the coming weeks.The stock is displaying a strong and sustained bullish trend, characterized by a series of higher highs and higher lows on the long-term chart.Recently, it has broken out of a prolonged base formation with rising volumes — a classic indication of accumulation and growing investor interest. This breakout has also coincided with a clear move above its descending trendline resistance, suggesting a potential transition from a corrective phase to a renewed uptrend.For a considerable period, the stock had been consolidating within a wide range between ₹38 and ₹55, effectively forming a rectangle pattern. The latest price action, supported by technical breakouts, strengthens the likelihood of an upward move toward the upper band of ₹55 — a level that also represents a key historical supply zone.The stock is on the verge of breaking out above the range of the past nine sessions, indicating strength and the potential continuation of its upward move — presenting a fresh entry opportunity.It is currently holding above both its short- and medium-term moving averages, which reinforces the positive bias. Key support is positioned in the ₹450–₹445 zone, a crucial confluence of major moving averages and previous significant lows.Looking ahead, we anticipate the stock to move higher toward the ₹505 mark in the coming month, which corresponds to the 80% retracement level of the prior major decline from ₹546 to ₹414.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for September 26, 2025 are Sagility, and Hindustan Zinc. Nifty is currently placed around the immediate support area of 24,900, being the presence of the 50-day EMA and key retracement area.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124142086,imgsize-76758,width-400,resizemode-4/top-stocks-to-buy.jpg"

Kotak Institutional Equities have a sell recommendation on Cochin Shipyard with the target price at Rs 860. Analysts said that the government has announced a Rs 70,000 crore package to boost domestic shipbuilding through capital support, legal reforms, and demand aggregation from oil & gas public sector units. This, coupled with CSL’s MoU with HD KSOE for commercial vessel construction, could be a twin catalyst for the company’s shipbuilding ambitions. However, execution remains a key risk, especially given that there is a limited impact of Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Policy (SFAP) 2016 and scaling-up of shipbuilding is complex and capital intensive. As both the developments are in the preliminary stage, the analysts have not factored in any upside to their estimates.Citigroup has a buy rating on RBL Bank with the target price at Rs 300. Analysts said the bank’s management believes net interest margins (NIMs) have bottomed out in April-June quarter (Q1) and improvement is anticipated in the current quarter onwards. They also believe advances growth is accelerating led by secured retail and commercial banking, while MFI disbursements now outpace repayments, eliminating further portfolio run-down concerns.They also said the stress in the joint lending group is subsiding while credit cards are taking longer to normalise. The lender is also building traction for core fee income from Q1 base. Also the bank’s cost control initiatives are currently underway and the impact to become discernible from Oct-Dec quarter (Q3) onwards.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Sun Pharmaceuticals with the target price at Rs 1,948. Analysts said in India, the company should outpace the domestic market, led by chronic-heavy portfolio, volume growth, new launches, and stronger prescriber engagement. The company is also preparing for a Day-1 entry in India's Semaglutide (GLP-1 injectable) market, while Leqselvi shows strong early uptake, Ilumya anchors growth and Unloxcyt’s US launch in the second half of FY26 marks the next scale-up.Nomura has a neutral rating on Glenmark Pharma with the target price at Rs 1,500. Analysts said the company has announced an in-licensing agreement with Hengrui Pharma for Trastuzumab Rezetecan, an oncology antibody drug conjugate. Under the agreement, Glenmark will obtain exclusive rights to develop & commercialise products largely in India and select emerging markets. As part of the agreement, Glenmark shall make an upfront payment of $18 million. They said Hengrui is also eligible for regulatory & commercial milestone payout of up to $1.1 billion. Analysts also believe Trastuzumab Rezetecan will be the largest contributor to the company’s target to get to $350-400 million in innovation drug revenues in the next 5-7 years.CLSA has an outperform rating on HAL with the target price at Rs 5,436. Analysts said that the company reached an important milestone with the first flight of the 13th LCA Mk 1A aircraft this week against the 12 it aimed to deliver in FY26, putting to rest any concerns regarding its role in delay. Also, GE has promised to deliver 12 engines for 2025 and 20 in 2026, which is key for final delivery of the aircraft, they said. The starting of delivery of the first two fully armed Mk 1As is key to HAL winning its repeat order worth Rs 67,000 crore ($7.8 billion), which should add 35% to its $22 billion backlog. Its decadal pipeline remains healthy at $54 billion.","Kotak Institutional Equities have a sell recommendation on Cochin Shipyard. Citigroup has a buy rating on RBL Bank.

Rupee invoicing picking up in Middle East: StanChart's Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-invoicing-picking-up-in-middle-east-stancharts-singh/articleshow/124135759.cms,"



MUMBAI: Standard Chartered India CEO P D Singh sees the India-Middle East trade corridor as a promising one for adoption of rupee invoicing, even though it's a gradual shift.""It is picking up in Middle Eastern corridors and could expand in future, much like how Chinese yuan invoicing became common in solar equipment trade,"" he said, adding that the move was steady but not yet large-scale.Govt and RBI have been working on internationalisation of the rupee to protect forex reserves and ensure energy security. However, a major impediment has been the lack of a balance of trade.The bank is also strengthening its role in foreign exchange clearing. Singh said, Standard Chartered, already one of the largest players globally, would soon launch US dollar clearing from GIFT City. ""We are the number one or two in GBP (pound) and euro clearing for the Indian banking system. Outside G3 currencies, the rupee is the biggest in correspondent banking flows. With 33 Indian banks as partners, this positions us strongly as a clearing bank,"" Singh said.On energy trade, Singh said India could absorb the cost impact of diversifying away from Russian crude if sanctions tightened and the issue was more about the country's independence. ""If India were to switch entirely to US oil, the additional cost would be $6-7 billion.In the broader context of Indian economy, that is not a very large number. From the bank's standpoint, we will not deal with sanctioned entities,"" he said.On the US visa policy, Singh said it was too early to assess the impact of changes to H-1B rules but added that India remained a hub for global capability centres. ""We are banking five to seven new GCCs every month, and in our own centres in Chennai and Bangalore we employ around 24,000 people. India today is not just a cost hub, it is a skills hub,"" he said.",Standard Chartered India CEO P D Singh sees the India-Middle East trade corridor as a promising one for adoption of rupee invoicing.

PUNE: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday called upon banks and financial institutions with strong balance sheets to step up lending for public infrastructure, industry and the MSME sector.Addressing the Foundation Day event of Bank of Maharashtra, Sitharaman highlighted the critical role of banks amid growing global uncertainty. ""The global environment has become increasingly unpredictable. The extent to which countries are affected depends on their exposure to these shocks and how well-prepared they are.""FM said despite the turbulence in the global economy, India showed resilience, supported by strong economic fundamentals and improved sovereign ratings from international agencies. She emphasised that India's robust response to global challenges was not coincidental but driven by solid domestic demand and the inherent strength of its economy.Sitharaman also stressed the need for public sector banks to maintain professional management and a customer-centric approach. ""Every complaint must be seen as an opportunity to improve, innovate and reinforce trust in the minds of the customers. Grievance redressal must go hand in hand with root cause analysis, systemic corrections in products, processes and conduct, besides a commitment to ensure the complaints do not recur.At the event, department of financial services secretary M Nagaraju said the credit extended by banks to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) would aid in their expansion, helping them cope with financial stress in distressed sectors. ""Govt has been laying great emphasis on providing more capital to MSMEs. But banks should also provide more capital to the MSMEs, both for expansion and recovery from stress, if there is any,"" he said.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman called upon banks and financial institutions with strong balance sheets to step up lending for public infrastructure, industry and the MSME sector.

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

In the firing line

Silver lining for laid off tech workers with H-1B visas





Donald Trump’s H-1B visa fee hike may turn out to be a blessing in disguise for techies who have recently been laid off by firms like Oracle, Intel, Microsoft, and AWS. The recent H-1B visa fee hike to $100,000 for new applicants could encourage employers to consider recruiting H-1B holders who have been laid off recently.Since the start of 2025, 533 rounds of layoffs at technology firms have affected as many as 144,926 individuals, according to data from monitoring platform Trueup quoted in an ET report. The platform's data indicates that 2024 saw 1,115 rounds of staff reductions at tech organisations, impacting 238,461 professionals.Individuals on H-1B visas who face layoffs whilst holding an active visa status have a 60-day window to secure alternative employment or depart from the United States.""Some of the ones laid off might be getting a call back,"" said Navneet S Chugh, attorney at US-based immigration law firm Chugh LLC, whilst noting that current H-1B visa workers, renewals, re-entries and employer transfers remain exempt from this fee, as clarified by the White House on Sunday.""For employers that act quickly and navigate compliance effectively, recently laid-off H-1B professionals represent a ready-to-deploy talent pool,"" Sachin Alug, CEO of recruitment company NLB Services, told ET.""Because they already hold H-1B status, they can often transition through a transfer petition without re-entering the lottery, making them highly attractive in terms of speed and cost efficiency. ""Also Read | After $100,000 fee, Trump administration looks to abandon lottery system for H-1B visas; here’s the proposed new selection criteria A product manager in Mountain View, California, whose employment at a consulting organisation ended on September 8, was quoted as saying, ""The moment I heard the news, I thought my days in the US were officially over. But after the clarification, there is a renewed hope. I am aggressively applying and expecting recruitment calls over the next week.""According to Sanketh Chengappa KG, director and business head-professional staffing at Adecco India, many affected professionals might receive opportunities for rehiring or attractive offers from alternative organisations, creating a select pool of readily available talent for crucial positions, particularly in technology, engineering and strategic digital sectors.Major US corporations including Amazon, Meta, and Google are anticipated to benefit primarily from the H-1B visa modifications, as they possess the financial capacity to accommodate increased fees for skilled professionals, according to immigration specialists. The $100,000 fee corresponds to the annual compensation of a standard employee recruited through this programme, they indicated.""The impact on companies remains uncertain at this stage,"" remarked Debarghya Das, partner at US-based Menlo Ventures. ""The expectation is that IT services organisations and employers offering lower wages will bear the brunt, accounting for approximately 40-60% of all H-1B applications.""Also Read | Trump’s H-1B visa fee hike to backfire? Wall Street banks set to rely more on Indian GCCs; may deepen presence in India Technology corporations typically maintain a modest H-1B workforce, with under 15% of staff on these visas, and most applications from major tech firms being renewals, Das noted, adding,""Microsoft, for example, had less than 2,000 net new H-1B last year, which is $200 million in fees, a 0.6% increase in annual R&D (research and development) spend of $30 billion for the company.

US market today: Wall Street slips for a third straight day as tech drags; bond yields rise on growth surprises,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-market-today-wall-street-slips-for-a-third-straight-day-as-tech-drags-bond-yields-rise-on-growth-surprises/articleshow/124122188.cms,"



Wall Street struggled on Thursday, heading toward a rare three-day losing streak as investors digested stronger-than-expected US economic data and corporate results.The S&P 500 fell 0.7% in early trading, marking a deeper decline than the previous two days, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 107 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite slid 1%. All three indexes remained close to the record highs set earlier this week, AP reported.Economic reports showed fewer US workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, suggesting layoffs may be slowing. The US economy also grew faster in the spring than previously estimated, and orders for manufactured goods with a relatively long life span exceeded forecasts, adding pressure on expectations for future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Treasury yields ticked higher, with the 10-year note rising to 4.17% and the two-year yield climbing more sharply.CarMax tumbled 19.1%, the largest loss in the S&P 500, after reporting weaker quarterly profits and fewer vehicle sales compared with last year. Loss projections from past loans also weighed on the stock.Big Tech stocks, which have driven recent market gains, also fell. Nvidia declined 1.8%, Broadcom lost 2.9%, and Alphabet dropped 2.2%, reflecting investor caution about high valuations amid artificial intelligence enthusiasm.Starbucks fluctuated between modest gains and losses after announcing a $1 billion restructuring plan that includes store closures and cutting 900 non-retail jobs, most recently down 0.7%.European markets followed a weaker trend, with Germany’s DAX falling 1% and France’s CAC 0 down 0.7%, after Asia saw a more muted finish.","The S&P 500 fell 0.7% in early trading, marking a deeper decline than the previous two days.

US economy growth: GDP expands at surprising 3.8% pace in April-June quarter; trade shifts drive Q2 upgrade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-growth-gdp-expands-at-surprising-3-8-pace-in-april-june-quarter-trade-shifts-drive-second-quarter-upgrade/articleshow/124120240.cms,"



The US economy grew at an unexpected 3.8 per cent annualised pace in the second quarter, significantly higher than the previously estimated 3.3 per cent, government data showed Thursday. The revision highlights a strong rebound from a first-quarter contraction of 0.6 per cent and underscores the influence of shifting trade patterns on the country’s economic performance.Imports, which surged earlier in the year as businesses rushed to beat tariff deadlines, fell by 29.3% in the second quarter, AP reported. The drop added more than five percentage points to GDP, the department noted. Consumer spending also accelerated, rising at a 2.5% pace compared with 0.6% in the first quarter.The Trump administration has imposed double-digit tariffs on imports ranging from steel and aluminum to autos, a move the president argues protects US industry and offsets the cost of his sweeping tax cuts. “With tariffs, we are bringing factories back and making America strong again,” Trump has repeatedly said.But mainstream economists caution the protectionist strategy risks slowing growth and fuelling inflation.They argue tariffs are paid by US importers, who often pass costs to consumers. While inflationary effects have so far been modest, economists warn the unpredictable tariff rollouts have unsettled businesses and dampened hiring.Labour Department data revisions this month showed that 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the year ending March than first reported, pulling the monthly average down to 71,000. Since March, job growth has slowed further, averaging just 53,000 a month.The Fed, seeking to support the labour market, cut its benchmark interest rate last week for the first time since December. The Commerce Department will release its initial July-September GDP estimate on October 30, with economists surveyed by FactSet forecasting growth to slow to 1.5%.","The US economy grew at an unexpected 3.8% annualised pace in the second quarter, significantly higher than the previously estimated 3.3%.

Starbucks is laying off around 900 non-retail employees and shutting some stores in the US and Canada as part of a broader turnaround strategy, the company announced on Thursday, AP reported. Employees whose roles are being eliminated will be informed early Friday, while the closures will be rolled out in the coming days.The Seattle-based coffee chain said a review of its North American locations showed many outlets were underperforming financially or not meeting customer expectations. “Each year, we open and close coffeehouses for a variety of reasons, from financial performance to lease expirations. This is a more significant action that we understand will impact partners and customers. Our coffeehouses are centers of the community, and closing any location is difficult,” Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol wrote in a letter to staff.Following the move, Starbucks expects to end its fiscal year with 18,300 stores in North America, down 124 from last year. It is unusual for the company to reduce its store count within a fiscal year.Niccol, a turnaround specialist brought in a year ago to revive Starbucks, previously led Chipotle through a dramatic recovery. During his six-year tenure there, the brand doubled its revenue and profit while its stock price soared.Starbucks said it will offer severance and support packages to employees affected by the layoffs.","Starbucks is laying off around 900 non-retail employees and shutting some stores in the US and Canada.

China’s move ‘to safeguard WTO’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-move-to-safeguard-wto/articleshow/124102771.cms,"



China will no longer claim benefits available to developing nations at the World Trade Organization, announced Chinese Premier Li Qiang. He is currently in the US to attend the United Nations General Assembly. WTO director general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala welcomed the decision on X, calling it “a culmination of many years of hard work” and thanking China’s leadership. The gesture is significant at a time when higher US tariffs are forcing China to divert ever more of its exports to rising economic powers from Latin America to Africa and Southeast Asia, a push that’s starting to meet resistance around the world.And as Beijing looks to negotiate a more lasting trade deal with the US, it’s also likely an effort to curry favour with President Donald Trump, who has long bristled at the designation he’d said was unfairly applied to the world’s second-biggest economy.While no longer eligible for the special treatment, China’s status as a developing nation won’t change, Han Yong, a ministry of commerce official in charge of relations with WTO, said in Beijing on Wednesday. Wendy Cutler, a senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and veteran US trade negotiator, said the announcement is “years too late”.“In light of the absence of a WTO negotiating agenda and the slow pace of its reform efforts, the announcement — while welcome — will have little practical effect,” said Cutler.But it “will help Beijing make the case of its enduring commitment to the multilateral trading system, in sharp contrast to Washington which is holding up its dues to the organisation.”China’s move not to claim the benefits “is an important measure to safeguard and strengthen the multilateral trading system”. The US Trade Representative and the White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for more information on the announcement.","China will no longer claim benefits available to developing nations at the World Trade Organization, announced Chinese Premier Li Qiang.

The US Treasury is in discussions with Argentina to provide a $20 billion swap line to the South American country’s central bank, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday, as right-wing President Javier Milei seeks to stabilise markets ahead of upcoming midterm elections. Following the announcement, the Argentine peso gained 2.4 percent to 1,333.90 per dollar.“The Treasury is currently in negotiations with Argentine officials for a $20 billion swap line with the Central Bank,” Bessent said in a social media post, a day after he and US President Donald Trump spoke with Milei, AFP reported. He added that the US is also prepared to purchase Argentina’s dollar-denominated bonds as needed.Milei, an ally of Trump in Latin America, thanked the US leadership for their “support and confidence.” Swap lines allow central banks to exchange currencies at predetermined rates for a specified period, helping stabilise markets during periods of financial stress.Trump, speaking on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, said the US would assist Argentina but added, “I don’t think they need a bailout.” Argentina’s currency had weakened sharply after Milei’s party lost the Buenos Aires provincial election on September 7, a key indicator ahead of national legislative elections on October 26.Bessent emphasised that Argentina “has the tools to defeat speculators, including those who seek to destabilise Argentina’s markets for political objectives.” However, domestic criticism emerged, with Senator Elizabeth Warren calling a potential US intervention “deeply troubling” and questioning the use of emergency funds to bolster a foreign government’s financial markets.The announcement comes as Milei faces declining support following two years of austerity measures and a corruption scandal involving his sister, after initially being cheered by investors upon his 2023 election.","The US Treasury is in discussions with Argentina to provide a $20 billion swap line.

US stocks showed modest gains on Wednesday as Wall Street paused after a strong rally that pushed major indexes to near record highs.The S&P 500 rose 0.1% in early trading following its first loss in four days, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 152 points, or 0.3%, AP reported. The Nasdaq composite was up 0.1%, with all three indexes hovering close to all-time peaks set on Monday.The market’s recent surge, which began after April lows, has been driven by hopes that President Donald Trump’s tariffs will not disrupt global trade and expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to support economic growth. Concerns remain that stocks may have become overvalued if anticipated rate cuts do not materialise.Individual stock movements were mixed.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) on Wednesday welcomed China’s decision not to seek new special treatment in future WTO negotiations, calling it a step toward a more equitable global trading system.“This is a pivotal moment for the WTO,” said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, WTO Director-General, news agency AFP reported. “China's decision reflects a commitment to a more balanced and equitable global trading system.”Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced on Tuesday, during a high-level meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, that Beijing would no longer pursue special and differential treatment — privileges granted to developing nations — in upcoming WTO talks, according to China’s official Xinhua news agency.Li described China as “a responsible major developing country,” emphasizing the announcement was aimed at addressing challenges to the multilateral trading system.Li Yihong, China’s charge d’affaires at its WTO mission, told reporters that the decision does not change China’s classification as a developing country. “This is a concrete measure to proactively assume responsibility and demonstrate the commitment of a major developing country,” she said.Special and differential treatment under WTO agreements allows developing countries longer timeframes for implementing commitments and measures to expand trading opportunities. Wealthier nations, including the US, have argued that China, now the world’s largest merchandise trader, should relinquish such privileges.Okonjo-Iweala said the move “marks a significant step in the ongoing discussions about the role of large, advanced developing economies within the multilateral trading system” and “sends a strong signal of support for WTO reform, helping foster a more level playing field for all members.”She added that the decision “will energise discussions and help the WTO work toward a more agile and effective organisation for the 21st century.”","Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced on Tuesday that Beijing would no longer pursue special and differential treatment in upcoming WTO talks.

'Both India, US-Based Firms Have Raised Concerns': Dhruva Jaishankar On H-1B Fee Hike

Firms will cut H-1B workers



Impact on startups







The Trump administration’s sharp increase in visa fees for H-1B workers has triggered concern among US technology companies, with many considering moving more jobs overseas — the very outcome the policy aimed to prevent.US President Donald Trump announced on Friday a steep $100,000 levy for new H-1B applicants, a visa program long used by tech firms to recruit skilled workers and by international students seeking US employment after postgraduate studies.While the fee applies only to new applicants and not current visa holders, confusion around its rollout and cost has prompted companies to pause hiring and adjust workforce plans.“I have had several conversations with corporate clients … where they have said this new fee is simply unworkable in the US, and it's time for us to start looking for other countries where we can have highly skilled talent,” said Chris Thomas, immigration attorney at Colorado-based law firm Holland & Hart, as quoted by Reuters.“And these are large companies, some of them household names, Fortune 100 type companies, that are saying, we just simply cannot continue.”Previously costing employers only a few thousand dollars, the new $100,000 fee flips the equation, making hiring talent in countries like India, where wages are lower and Big Tech increasingly builds innovation hubs, more attractive.“We probably have to reduce the number of H-1B visa workers we can hire,” said Sam Liang, co-founder and CEO of AI meeting assistant startup Otter.ai.“Some companies may have to outsource some of their workforce — hire maybe in India or other countries just to walk around this H-1B problem,” he added.“Blanket rulings like this are rarely good for immigration,” said Deedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures, which has invested in startups including AI firm Anthropic.“For larger companies, the cost is not material. For smaller companies, those with fewer than 25 employees, it's much more significant. Big tech CEOs expected this and will pay. For them, fewer small competitors is even an advantage. It’s the smaller startups that suffer most,” he added, as reported by Reuters.Analysts warn the policy could reduce the number of talented immigrants who often go on to launch new firms. A 2022 report from the National Foundation for American Policy found that more than half of US startups valued at $1 billion or more had at least one immigrant founder.","US President Donald Trump announced on Friday a steep $100,000 levy for new H-1B applicants.

Despite Trump 'Economic Sanctions', India's Russian Oil Flow Ramped Up As U.S Trade Talks Resume





Russia’s crude oil exports have climbed to a 16-month high at a time when its own refineries are reeling under drone attacks from Ukraine. Vessel-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg shows that the four-week average exports from Russian ports reached 3.62 million barrels daily during the period ending September 21.This marks the highest level since May 5, 2024. The four-week average provides more reliable trend indicators compared to weekly statistics.Russia's oil production is increasing as part of an OPEC+ agreement, which has allowed Moscow to raise its output by over 400,000 barrels daily since March. Recent drone attacks on refineries have compelled companies to redirect crude to export terminals, further increasing the export volume.JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates indicate that Russian refining operations have declined to under 5 million barrels daily, the lowest since April 2022, due to Ukrainian drone attacks.Typically, Russia's downstream sector processed approximately 5.4 million barrels of crude daily during August and September, suggesting these strikes have impacted at least 7% of Russia's fuel production capacity, according to Bloomberg calculations.The strikes on pipeline-connected pumping stations have not significantly disrupted supplies to export terminals along Russia's Baltic and Black Sea shores. The Baltic port of Primorsk achieved a milestone by loading 12 crude cargoes in the previous week. Whilst pump station damage may reduce flow rates, it hasn't caused complete stoppages, and port storage facilities enable continuous shipments during repair work.The prospect of additional sanctions to compel Russia towards peace negotiations regarding Ukraine appears distant.US President Donald Trump has stated that further American measures depend on European Union nations completely stopping Russian oil purchases, which seems unlikely in the near term as Hungary and Slovakia remain resistant.The EU is considering implementing trade measures, such as tariffs, to address remaining crude volumes instead of sanctions. Trade measures require only majority support, whilst sanctions need unanimous approval from member states.Vessel-tracking data and port-agent reports indicate that between September 15-21, 31 tankers loaded 23.69 million barrels of Russian crude, an increase from the previous week's 22.26 million barrels carried by 29 vessels.The total value of Moscow's exports showed a modest increase, rising by approximately $50 million to reach $1.33 billion in the week to September 21.","Russia's oil production is increasing as part of an OPEC+ agreement, which has allowed Moscow to raise its output by over 400,000 barrels daily since March.

Kenvue stock rebounds: Tylenol maker rises 6% after Donald Trump’s autism claims; analysts see limited legal impact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/kenvue-stock-rebounds-tylenol-maker-rises-6-after-donald-trumps-autism-claims-analysts-see-limited-legal-impact/articleshow/124074082.cms,"Trump Stirs Panic On Tylenol Use, Warns Of Autism Link; Sparks Uproar | Make America Healthy Again





Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue rebounded sharply on Tuesday, recovering from a steep fall triggered by President Donald Trump’s unfounded remarks linking the drug to autism.At the opening bell, Kenvue shares climbed more than 6 per cent, a day after plunging 7.5 per cent, AP reported. Trump had repeatedly instructed pregnant women to avoid Tylenol during a White House press conference on Monday, also cautioning mothers against giving the drug—known as acetaminophen in the US and paracetamol in many other countries—to infants.“Don’t take Tylenol,” Trump told pregnant women around a dozen times, despite relying on older studies rather than significant new research. His comments coincided with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, promoting the “Make America Healthy Again” campaign, which has focused on potential causes of autism.Kenvue strongly rejected the claim, saying there is no proven link between acetaminophen and autism. The company warned that pregnant women could face “a dangerous choice” if they avoid Tylenol, potentially exposing themselves to untreated fevers or riskier alternatives.Citi Investment Research analyst Filippo Falorni told AP “limited risk of new lawsuits after Trump’s announcement” but cautioned that “there could be risk to Tylenol consumption given the negative headlines.”He expected a positive market reaction given the absence of new scientific evidence.Kenvue, spun off from Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical and medical device divisions in 2023, makes Band-Aids, Listerine and other well-known brands in addition to Tylenol. The company has already faced hundreds of lawsuits over alleged ties between Tylenol and autism, but most have been dismissed.The consumer health firm’s recovery also comes in the shadow of Tylenol’s troubled history. In the 1980s, seven people in the Chicago area died after taking cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules, an incident that sparked nationwide panic and led to sweeping reforms in over-the-counter medicine packaging. No one was ever charged.","Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue rebounded sharply on Tuesday, recovering from a steep fall triggered by President Donald Trump’s unfounded remarks linking the drug to autism.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

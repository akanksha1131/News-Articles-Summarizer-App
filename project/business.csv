Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices extended their pullback for the second consecutive week amid strong global market momentum. The Reserve Bank of India’s recent dovish stance, aimed at fostering credit growth, provided crucial support to market sentiment. In its latest policy decision, the RBI kept the repo rate steady at 5.5%, signaling a cautious but accommodative approach.After a robust up move, where the Nifty surged over 600 points within just four sessions from 24,588 to 25,220, the index has entered a phase of consolidation over the past two sessions. Moving forward, the Nifty needs to decisively close above the 25,220 marks for a meaningful pullback to take shape. Failing this, the index is likely to continue oscillating within the 25,220 to 24,700 range, driven largely by stock-specific movements ahead of the Q2FY26 earnings season.On the upside, a sustained move above Tuesday’s high of 25,220 would pave the way for further gains towards the 25,400-25,500 levels, where the trendline resistance connecting the major highs of June and September 2025 lies.On the downside, strong support is seen between 24,800 and 24,700, marked by the confluence of the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally from 24,588 to 25,220.Key Monitorables Going Forward:Overall, the market appears poised for cautious consolidation, supported by favorable macro factors but awaiting clearer direction from earnings and global cues.Bank Nifty displayed notable relative strength throughout the week, outperforming Nifty as buying momentum returned across major banking stocks post RBI monetary policy meeting. The strong up move in the last 2 weeks reflects renewed bullish sentiment, indicating that the banking sector is regaining leadership. Sustained buying momentum could further strengthen investor confidence and drive additional upside in the coming weeks.Bank Nifty after a 2300 points up-move in just 6 sessions is witnessing consolidation in the last 2 sessions. We expect the index to consolidate in the range of 56,500-55,500 thus forming a base for the next leg of up move.On the higher side a move above Tuesday’s high of 56500 would open further upside towards the all-time high of 57,300-57,600 in the coming weeks.On the downside support is placed at 55,500-55,000 levels being the confluence of the 20- & 50-days EMA and the 61.8% retracement of the last up move (54,227-56,502). We believe bias remains positive and dips should be used as a buying opportunity.Jayaswal Neco Industries (JNIL’s) strong captive iron ore resource base in Chhattisgarh provides a structural advantage in securing raw material supplies, with mining leases valid through 2052–2055 and scalable production potential up to 4 MTPA. Expansion across the value chain, including a 1.5 MTPA pellet plant and a new beneficiation facility, positions the company to capture higher value-added margins and operational efficiencies. The upcoming washery expansion, expected by October 2025, is set to deliver annual cost savings of ₹800–900 million, further improving profitability.In parallel, JNIL’s proactive debt refinancing of ₹23 billion with Tata Capital marks a pivotal balance sheet improvement, lowering borrowing costs from 17.5% to 12.5% and extending repayment tenure to 72 months. This move will enhance cash flow visibility, strengthen liquidity, and improve credit metrics. Collectively, these operational and financial initiatives support a positive outlook on JNIL’s earnings trajectory and reinforce confidence in the company’s long-term value creation potential.The stock has confirmed a breakout from an inverse head and shoulders pattern, decisively moving above its falling trendline resistance.After a phase of prolonged consolidation, it is now breaking out of its trading range, indicating a potential shift in trend.Key supports are placed at ₹240 and ₹225, while on the upside, immediate resistance is seen around ₹300 being the recent range breakout. The breakout is further validated by rising volumes, reinforcing bullish momentum.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 10, 2025 are Jayaswal Neco Industries, and Bank of Baroda. The Reserve Bank of India’s recent dovish stance, aimed at fostering credit growth, provided crucial support to market sentiment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124442307,imgsize-80346,width-400,resizemode-4/top-stocks-to-buy.jpg"

Drama In Kuwait: EU Bigwig BLAMES Gulf States For Bloc's Failure In Isolating Russia | Watch



What Nayara is doing to sustain operations?





Nayara Energy, the Indian refinery with major Russian ownership, is scrambling to sustain operations after being hit by European Union sanctions. The Russian-owned refinery, facing exclusion from many international markets due to severe EU sanctions implemented on July 18, has been compelled to redirect additional fuel towards domestic consumption whilst seeking alternative export destinations, amongst various necessary adaptations required by the EU restrictions.According to a Reuters report, from late August onwards, Nayara Energy's refinery has intensified its railway usage, dispatching two to three trains daily, each comprising 50 tanker cars to transport fuel to inland storage facilities. This is more than twice its previous railway utilisation for diesel and petrol transportation.Nayara's Russian ownership exemplifies the enduring close relationship between New Delhi and Moscow, a connection that positions India differently from Western allies.The government has found itself managing a delicate situation with Nayara's ongoing difficulties, providing essential operational support whilst being cautious not to trigger Western opposition, according to government and company officials quoted in the report. The administration's assistance includes allocation of tank wagons and authorisation for coastal vessels to transport the refinery's products.The refinery, with Russian state oil corporation Rosneft as its primary stakeholder, now sources its crude oil requirements exclusively from Russia, following the cessation of Iraqi and Saudi Arabian supplies post-EU sanctions. This dependency creates potential vulnerabilities should supply chains face disruption from enhanced sanctions or increased pressure from the Donald Trump administration.The UK government is evaluating dual strategies: supporting Nayara whilst being cognisant of mounting international pressure for stricter sanctions, according to Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies quoted in the report.""Long-term support might not be sustainable unless the whole global dynamics change - like a resolution between Russia and the U.S.A. or progress in Russia-Ukraine conflict,"" he said.The Mumbai-based Nayata holds significant influence in India's expanding fuel industry, contributing 8% of refined products output and managing over 6,500 petrol stations.The company has been compelled to decrease crude processing at its 400,000-barrel-per-day Vadinar refinery to 70-80% capacity - down from its previous 104% - as it encounters difficulties securing export customers for its fuel and banking institutions to process payments, according to sources familiar with refinery operations.Nayara adapted its operations by increasing railway transportation after sanctions impeded its coastal shipping and export capabilities, necessitating domestic distribution of its products, the Reuters report said.The refinery, lacking pipeline connectivity, received assistance from the government to access additional railcars and temporary permission to operate four coastal vessels, including the sanctioned Leruo and two vessels from the shadow fleet: the Garuda (Guinea-Bissau flag) and Chongchon (Djibouti flag), the report said.The company has requested governmental authorisation for two additional coastal vessels. Additionally, Nayara seeks official support to acquire equipment and materials, currently restricted by sanctions, for its maintenance closure initially planned for February. Sources indicate the company might postpone the shutdown until April whilst searching for alternative materials.""We are under constant threat,"" a senior company official said on condition of anonymity, citing the worry that vessels the company is now using could come under future Western sanctions.""We never anticipated that we would be hit so directly. Now, every day feels like firefighting.""Nayara - the name is a mix of Hindi and English for ""New Era"" - previously operated as Essar Oil before its 2017 acquisition by Rosneft alongside a consortium including Russian fund UCP and Trafigura, with the latter later divesting its stake.The company sourced oil from diverse nations until 2022. Subsequently, India increased its Russian oil imports at discounted rates following Western sanctions on Moscow post the Ukraine invasion, becoming the primary buyer of Russian seaborne crude.The refiner's primary concerns centre on maintenance issues and international payment capabilities, according to internal sources at Nayara quoted in the Reuters report.Since August, the state-owned SBI has halted processing of trade and forex transactions for Nayara, citing concerns about EU sanctions.Despite meetings between Nayara officials, finance ministry representatives and banks to address these banking complications, a resolution remains pending. This situation hampers the company's ability to conduct international crude imports and fuel exports, as per government sources.Recent shipments have been directed to the Middle East, Turkey, Taiwan and Brazil, with 16 cargo loads of diesel, gasoline and jet fuel transported via EU-sanctioned vessels, according to available data.","Nayara Energy, the Indian refinery with major Russian ownership, is scrambling to sustain operations after being hit by European Union sanctions.

Sebi eyes easier NRI market access: Chairman flags urgent KYC reforms; focus on digital FPI registration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-eyes-easier-nri-market-access-chairman-flags-urgent-kyc-reforms-focus-on-digital-fpi-registration-and-market-resilience/articleshow/124485712.cms,"



Easing investment procedures for non-resident Indians (NRIs) is an “urgent goal” for Sebi, Chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey said on Saturday, highlighting plans to simplify compliance and expand participation in Indian capital markets. Speaking at an event organised by the Bombay Stock Exchange Brokers’ Forum, Pandey emphasised the need for NRIs to complete know-your-customer (KYC) formalities without travelling to India.“We are yet to establish an easy and secure KYC access for NRIs to facilitate their participation in the securities market. This will be an urgent goal for us,” Pandey said, adding that Sebi is coordinating with the RBI and the Unique Identification Authority of India to develop a digital system for NRIs, PTI reported.With over 3.5 crore NRIs globally and India receiving USD 135 billion in remittances in FY25, Pandey said simplifying access to the markets could help tap a vast pool of investors. The move comes amid a slowdown in domestic retail investment, including a declining trend in systematic investment plan (SIP) inflows.Pandey also outlined Sebi’s broader agenda for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). Following September’s announcement of a single-window, lighter compliance framework, Sebi aims to make FPI registration simple and fully portal-based.“We are already consulting our stakeholders to implement it … we would like to be among the best in the world in terms of facilitating registration,” he said.On domestic market infrastructure, Pandey stressed that Sebi, the RBI, and Income Tax authorities will collaborate to digitise registration while maintaining robust risk controls. The regulator is also revising broker regulations, expected to be completed by December this year, and strengthening cybersecurity measures, including guidelines for “air gap” systems and redundancy for clearing corporations.Sebi has moved toward predictive oversight, revamping its data warehouse to generate role-based alerts to detect fraudulent trades and pump-and-dump schemes. Pandey noted the rising prominence of algorithmic and high-frequency trading in equity and derivatives markets, with Sebi updating its regulatory framework to ensure transparency and market integrity.Cash equity volumes, hovering around Rs 1 lakh crore daily, prompted Pandey to highlight the need for deeper liquidity. Sebi will also review the stock lending and borrowing mechanism (SLBM) and continue consultative reforms in short-term derivatives markets to safeguard investor suitability and risk awareness.Pandey encouraged innovation across financial instruments to enhance market resilience and capital raising. He specifically noted potential growth in Chhota SIPs and commodity derivatives, promising Sebi support in addressing tax, delivery, and GST-related challenges to unlock their market potential.","Easing investment procedures for non-resident Indians (NRIs) is an ‘urgent goal’ for Sebi, Chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey said.

Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday held discussions with his Canadian counterpart Maninder Sidhu on strengthening economic cooperation, signalling a possible thaw in bilateral trade relations that had soured in recent years.“We discussed ways to find mutually beneficial opportunities for our businesses to capitalise on the complementarities offered by our two economies. I emphasised that economic, trade and investment ties between India and Canada should be grounded in the principles of mutual respect, trust and balance,” Goyal said in a post on X after the meeting, PTI reported.Canada’s Minister of International Trade, Maninder Sidhu, in his post on X said he held talks with India’s commerce minister to advance discussions on deepening economic engagement and increasing connectivity between the two countries.“Together, we're exploring new trade opportunities in clean technology, AI, agriculture, critical minerals, and other key sectors,” he said.Responding to the post, Goyal added: “Held a productive discussion with my Canadian counterpart @MSidhuLiberal.”The meeting gains significance as negotiations for a free trade agreement between the two nations were paused in 2023 following diplomatic tensions. India-Canada relations had plunged after then Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged an Indian link to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a claim New Delhi dismissed as “absurd.”Talks for an interim trade deal, officially called the Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA), were re-launched in March 2022, with over six rounds of negotiations held so far. The pact aims to reduce or eliminate customs duties on key goods and liberalise investment and services trade between the two nations.India’s exports to Canada rose 9.8 per cent to $4.22 billion in 2024–25 from $3.84 billion in 2023–24, while imports dipped 2.33 per cent to $4.44 billion in the same period.Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand is scheduled to arrive in New Delhi on Sunday, further underscoring the renewed momentum in bilateral ties.

China defends new curbs on rare earth elements





The US-China trade war intensified on Sunday after Beijing accused Washington of ""double standards"" following President Donald Trump’s decision to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods.""The relevant US statement is a typical example of double standards,"" China's ministry of commerce said in a statement, according to Reuters.The ministry reaffirmed Beijing's stance on trade disputes, stating, ""China's position on tariff wars has been consistent. We do not want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight.""Beijing further accused Washington of escalating economic pressure since September, warning that the US approach was damaging trade relations.""Since the US-China economic and trade talks in Madrid, the US has continuously introduced a series of new restrictions against China,"" the ministry said.The ministry also condemned Washington’s recent trade measures, noting that the US had ""added multiple Chinese entities to ""its export control entity list and specially designated nationals list.""""These actions... have severely harmed China's interests and seriously undermined the atmosphere of the economic and trade talks between the two sides,"" the commerce ministry said.""Threatening high tariffs at every turn is not the right approach to engaging with China,"" it added.These remarks came after Trump announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods starting November 1, raising the overall tariff rate on Chinese imports to about 130%. Washington said the move was in response to China’s ""extraordinarily aggressive"" new export restrictions on rare-earth minerals.""Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position... the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,"" the US president posted on Truth Social.Also Read | 'Hostile order': Donald Trump rekindles trade war — Why has US threatened to impose additional 100% tariff on China? Trump also described Beijing's latest export curbs as ""very hostile,"" claiming China had sent letters ""to countries throughout the world"" outlining restrictions on ""each and every element of production having to do with rare earths.""""There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the world captive,"" Trump said, vowing that the US ""will financially counter their move.""The US President had also hinted that his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month may no longer take place, saying ""there seems to be no reason to do so.""However, speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump clarified that the meeting hadn’t been officially canceled but admitted its fate remained uncertain. ""I haven’t cancelled. However, I’m not sure if we’ll have it,"" he said.Beijing on October 9 announced its decision to impose sweeping new controls on the export of rare earth elements, minerals critical to the US defense, clean energy, and electric vehicle industries.The move was framed by China as a national security measure but was widely interpreted as retaliation for Washington's tightening semiconductor restrictions.Under the new rules, announced by China's ministry of commerce, any company, Chinese or foreign, must now seek Beijing’s approval before exporting products containing more than 0.1% rare earth content by value.The ministry also expanded its list of restricted materials and banned the export of rare earths for foreign military use.Rare earths, while not actually rare, are difficult to extract and process, and China dominates the global market, producing around 90% of the world’s supply.Adding to the strain, China also introduced extra port fees on US ships starting October 14 and launched an antitrust investigation into US chipmaker Qualcomm, signaling broader retaliation against Washington’s tech and trade pressure.These moves represented China's sharpest response in recent months, following US restrictions on semiconductor exports, blacklisting of several Chinese firms, and tighter controls on investment in Chinese technology sectors.Beijing, however, denied any direct link between its export curbs and the US tariffs, saying the restrictions were driven by national security concerns over the military use of these critical minerals amid ""frequent global conflicts.""Moreover, the ministry also clarified that the new rules are not a total export ban and said that applications meeting the necessary requirements ""will be granted licenses.""It added that China had ""notified relevant countries and regions through bilateral export control dialogue mechanisms"" before implementing the changes.","Beijing accused Washington of ""double standards"" following President Donald Trump’s decision to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods.

BENGALURU: Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Saturday to discuss India’s role in advancing responsible and beneficial AI, days after the company announced plans to open a Bengaluru office in early 2026.Amodei said India’s rapid AI adoption and technical depth make it central to the global trajectory of the technology. “Prime Minister Modi has set an ambitious vision for India’s AI future, one that balances innovation with responsibility and ensures technology serves all of India’s people,” he said in a post on X after the meeting. “How India deploys AI across critical sectors like education, healthcare, and agriculture for over a billion people will be essential in shaping the future of AI. ”He added that usage of Claude Code, Anthropic’s AI coding assistant, has risen fivefold in India since June, underscoring the country’s growing base of developers using AI for technical and software tasks. Amodei described India as one of the company’s fastest-expanding markets globally.The meeting capped a week-long visit during which Anthropic held its first India Developers Day in Bengaluru, co-hosted with venture-capital firm Accel.At the event, senior executives said India now ranks as the second-largest market for Claude globally, behind the US, with more than half its usage in the country being technical, from user-interface design to code debugging and software development.Anthropic’s upcoming Bengaluru office will anchor its presence in the Indo-Pacific region and focus on building local AI models and tools for Indian enterprises and startups. “We’re not entering a new market but deepening a relationship in a market we’re already in,” Anthropic’s Head of EMEA Guillaume Princen told developers at the event.In its statement earlier this week, Anthropic said it plans to work with Indian partners across education, healthcare, and agriculture, while also investing in local talent and Indic-language AI capabilities.

"Pharma expansion: Natco to acquire major stake in South Africa’s Adcock Ingram, firm to go private",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pharma-expansion-natco-to-acquire-major-stake-in-south-africas-adcock-ingram-firm-to-go-private/articleshow/124481987.cms,"



India’s Natco Pharma will acquire significant stakes in South African pharmaceutical giant Adcock Ingram in a deal valued at R4.2 billion, paving the way for the 135-year-old firm to become a privately held entity jointly owned by Natco and Bidvest, which will remain the majority shareholder.The decision followed a meeting of Adcock Ingram shareholders that approved Natco’s proposal to acquire all ordinary shares in the company, PTI reported. Natco had made a firm offer in July this year, as announced in a statement on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE) on Friday.Natco’s offer in July had triggered a 20 per cent jump in Adcock Ingram’s share price. According to the statement, Natco Pharma South Africa will acquire all ordinary shares in Adcock Ingram other than those already held by Natco, shares currently owned by Bidvest, and treasury shares of Adcock Ingram.More than 98 per cent of Adcock Ingram shareholders voted in favour of the Natco offer, after which the company will be delisted from the JSE.Founded in 1890 as a small pharmacy, Adcock Ingram has grown into a leading South African pharmaceutical company offering a wide range of prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), consumer, and hospital products, with several brands having become household names across South Africa.“As a proudly South African company, our focus lies not only in healthcare but also in the value we add to society through environmental protection, community upliftment, and philanthropy,” the company said on its website.Adcock Ingram told Moneyweb that it had ruled out any immediate shake-up to its product portfolio following Natco’s stake acquisition. The company said operations would continue as usual, and no brands would be discontinued unless it was economically necessary.The company said that its partnership with Natco Pharma would help it expand into markets beyond Southern Africa, where regulatory controls on medicine prices have limited its growth.“In the consumer segment, we have made significant progress in the personal care market, which is not price-regulated. However, our strategy, from a regulatory and risk perspective, has been to concentrate on the Southern African market, as we would lack economies of scale in territories further afield,” said Adcock Ingram CFO Dorette Neethling.“Support from a strong, vertically integrated, and globally resourced shareholder like Natco will help with portfolio expansion, particularly in the generics segment,” Neethling added.Analysts had earlier observed that Adcock Ingram’s performance was constrained by the sluggish South African economy despite its recent expansion into the informal consumer segment.Neethling also said that the proposed transaction would benefit the company by allowing it to operate privately under two large shareholders, providing flexibility and efficiency. “The potential transaction would allow Natco to strengthen its presence in South Africa and provide eligible Adcock Ingram shareholders with an opportunity to realise value now,” she said.Natco said the deal would give it a strong foothold in the Southern African market. “The proposed transaction will provide Natco Pharma with a well-established entry into the Southern African market,” Natco CEO and vice-chair Rajeev Nannapaneni said earlier.“It will also allow Natco Pharma to tap into new revenue streams and expand our footprint in one of the largest and growing emerging markets, while providing a gateway to the African continent,” Nannapaneni added.Adcock Ingram Group CEO Andrew Hall said the partnership with Natco would ultimately benefit South African consumers. “Adcock Ingram will benefit from a partnership with a research-focused, innovative, and vertically integrated pharmaceutical company, and over time South Africans will be beneficiaries of wider access to affordable medicines,” Hall said when the offer was announced.","Natco Pharma will acquire significant stakes in South African pharmaceutical giant Adcock Ingram in a deal valued at R4.2 billion.

NEW DELHI: Indo-China direct aerial connectivity is going to ramp up fast after an over five-year lull. IndiGo Saturday announced it will have a daily direct between Delhi and Guangzhou from November 10, shortly after the airline links Kolkata and Guangzhou from October 26. Air India will fly to the country before the end of the year and many Chinese carriers will have India flights. IndiGo has been among the first airlines to reinstate flights between the two countries.IndiGo head of global sales Vinay Malhotra said: “We are pleased to enhance our connectivity to China with daily direct flights between Delhi and Guangzhou, in addition to the recently resumed route from Kolkata. The resumption of operations between two of the world’s most populous nations presents immense potential for cultural exchange and economic collaboration. With this launch, IndiGo connects China to its vast domestic and growing international network, via Guangzhou. We are confident that this will contribute towards acceleration of opportunities in trade, investment, tourism, and even education, between the two countries, while reinforcing our commitment to connect India to the world.”In 2019, India and China had 539 direct flights operated by airlines including Air India, IndiGo, China Southern and China Eastern.In March 2020, international flights were halted during Covid. Since then travelling between India and China means doing so through a third country, mostly in Southeast Asia.The aviation ministry had said on X October 2 that direct flights between the two countries “follow continuous technical-level engagement between civil aviation authorities as part of broader efforts to normalise bilateral ties. The move will greatly enhance air connectivity, support people-to-people exchanges and contribute to the strengthening of economic collaboration between the two countries.”","IndiGo Saturday announced it will have a daily direct between Delhi and Guangzhou from November 10.

India needs to boost mariculture production to 25 lakh tonnes by 2047 from the current 1.5 lakh tonnes to meet the country’s rapidly growing seafood demand, CMFRI Director Grinson George said on Saturday.Speaking at the launch of a training programme for fish farmers under the central government’s Pradhan Mantri Dhan Dhanya Krishi Yojana (PMDDKY), George said mariculture is emerging as the next major growth area in India’s marine fisheries sector, PTI reported. Technologies such as cage culture and Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) could help increase marine fish production.“Due to climate change and resource depletion, India needs to explore alternative systems such as mariculture. To meet growing seafood demand, at least 25 lakh tonnes of mariculture production is targeted by 2047,” he said.George added that CMFRI has developed several mariculture technologies suited to Indian conditions, which can enhance productivity and improve fishermen’s livelihoods. He also highlighted India’s potential in seaweed farming.“While global seaweed production stands at 3.55 crore tonnes, India’s production remains very low.At least 50 lakh tonnes of domestic seaweed production could be achieved to meet growing industrial and nutraceutical demand,” George said.He stressed that India’s extensive coastline and favourable marine conditions provide the natural potential and scientific capability to emerge as a global mariculture hub. “If we adopt modern technologies and develop a strong policy framework, mariculture can transform the economic landscape of coastal India,” he added.George called for a national mariculture policy and supportive legal framework to promote sustainable, large-scale investment and systematic growth in the sector.",India needs to boost mariculture production to 25 lakh tonnes by 2047 from the current 1.5 lakh tonnes.

Trump Slaps 130% Tariffs On China As Trade Truce Collapses Over Rare Earth Clash | DETAILS





The trade war between the US and China dramatically escalated this week, reaching a new and alarming phase after tit-fortat export controls that rattled markets even as they were closing on Friday.Barring a pullback by both sides over the weekend, more pain is expected when markets re-open Monday, after a staggering $1.6 trillion was wiped out of the stock market when US President Donald Trump announced retaliatory measures against Beijing’s move to squeeze supply of critical technologies, including rare earths processing, on which it has a stranglehold.Who fired the first shot is a matter of perspective. The US has long weaponised its headstart on technology advances in areas like semi-conductors to punish adversaries (like China and Russia) and even deny it to purported friends (like India). On Thursday, Beijing signalled it has come of age and two can play the game by adopting similar means in areas where it has stolen a march over Washington.China’s ministry of commerce issued four announcements that, collectively, impose new licensing requirements on three critical global supply chains from Nov 8. They include rare earths and processing technology, where the controls will now go beyond minerals to include the specialised machinery and technical knowhow needed to process them into rare earth elements vital for everything from defence systems such as missiles and drones to EVs.For industrial super-hard materials controls were extended to synthetic diamonds and cutting tools used ubiquitously in high-precision manufacturing, including for cutting silicon wafers for computer chips.In addition, controls were placed on high-performance batteries and equipment, with new restrictions targeting lithium-ion batteries used in long-range electric vehicles and advanced drones, as well as the factory equipment necessary for their manufacture. Export controls were also placed on graphite anodes and cathode materials, the essential electrodes for batteries, and equipment to make them.Beijing said the moves are necessary to “safeguard national security and interests” and prevent “dual use”, echoing the rationale the US used for its own export controls on advanced semiconductors.Hours after the Chinese move, Trump condemned the measures as a “hostile order” and announced a staggering economic countermeasure, declaring the US would impose an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese goods, on top of existing duties from Nov 1. White House also announced new export controls on “any and all critical software”. The office of the US trade representative said the president is “responding forcefully and appropriately to safeguard America’s economic and national security”, accusing Beijing of “ordering the entire world to submit for approval to the Chinese Communist Partycontrolled govt any export containing rare earths processed or mined in China”.However, experts are divided on who started the trade scrap, with even many Western analysts suggesting it is Washington that has been picking fights, including expanding its entities list, in an effort to constrain China’s rise. Just this week the US added 15 Chinese companies to its restricted trade list, targeted China-based refineries buying Iranian oil with new sanctions, and announced new port fees on Chinese-made freight vessels beginning Oct 14.Some experts feel China’s “all-in” move on export controls is a direct response to this prior US pressure, seeking to demonstrate its own powerful leverage. Rush Doshi, a former national security council official, believes the timing of China’s move — weeks before a planned meeting between Trump and Xi at APEC summit — indicates Beijing believes the US “will fold” without a strong retaliatory play.Not if you believe Trump, derided with the acronym TACO (Trump Always ChickensOut). “For every element that they (Chinese) have been able to monopolise, we have two. I never thought it would come to this but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come,” he said in a post on Truth Social.","$1.6 trillion was wiped out of the stock market when US President Donald Trump announced retaliatory measures against Beijing.

With this China effectively gets veto power over three critical supply chains simultaneously: advanced semiconductors, battery-powered vehicles and drones, and precision manufacturing across industries,” Arnaud Bertrand, a global affairs analyst, noted on X, suggesting China has taken a leaf out of the US playbook.Hours after the Chinese move, president Trump condemned the measures as a ""hostile order"" and announced a staggering economic countermeasure, declaring the US would impose an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese goods, on top of existing duties, effective November 1, 2025. The White House also announced new export controls on ""any and all critical software."" The office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) said the president is ""responding forcefully and appropriately to safeguard America’s economic and national security,"" accusing Beijing of ""ordering the entire world to submit for approval to the Chinese Communist Party-controlled government any export containing rare earths processed or mined in China. ""However, experts are divided on who started the trade scrap, with even many western analysts suggesting it is Washington that has been picking fights, including expanding its entities list, in an effort to constrain China’s rise. Just this week, the US added 15 Chinese companies to its restricted trade list, targeted China-based refineries buying Iranian oil with new sanctions, and announced new port fees on Chinese-made freight vessels beginning October 14.Some experts think China's ""all-in"" move on export controls is a direct response to this prior US pressure, seeking to demonstrate its own powerful leverage. Rush Doshi, a former National Security Council officials and Georgetown University scholar and author of The Long Game: China's Grand Strategy to Displace American Order, believes the timing of China’s move —just weeks before a planned meeting between president Trump and president Xi Jinping at the APEC summit—indicates Beijing believes the US ""will fold"" without a strong retaliatory play.Not if you believe president Trump, derided with the acronym TACO -- Trump Always Chickens Out. “For every Element that they (Chinese) have been able to monopolise, we have two.

Lower drug prices for Americans! Trump seals deal with AstraZeneca; some medicines at discounts of up to 80%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/lower-drug-prices-for-americans-trump-seals-deal-with-astrazeneca-some-medicines-at-discounts-of-up-to-80/articleshow/124475480.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Friday announced reaching a deal with AstraZeneca, which would lower the cost of some prescription drugs for millions of Americans.The agreement will see the company sell certain medicines at reduced prices to the government’s Medicaid health plan in exchange for tariff relief. This follows a similar arrangement made with Pfizer last week.The White House is using these agreements as a model to pursue its broader goal of cutting the price of prescription medicines in the United States. In July, Trump sent letters to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, urging them to bring down their prices. So far, Pfizer and AstraZeneca are the first to finalise such deals with the administration.AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot said at an Oval Office event that the company will offer some of its drugs at discounts of up to 80% through a new TrumpRx website expected to launch next year. He added that the company would receive a three-year tariff exemption “to localize the remainder of our products.”US patients currently pay some of the highest drug prices in the world, nearly three times more than patients in other developed countries. Trump has been pressuring companies to match international prices or face steep tariffs.Negotiations with the industry had previously broken down earlier this year.But after striking a deal with Pfizer, the administration increased pressure by threatening tariffs of up to 100% to push other companies to follow suit, according to lobbyists and executives.More than 70 million Americans are enrolled in Medicaid, which serves low-income groups. However, most government spending on medicines comes from Medicare, which covers people over 65 and those with disabilities. Medicare spent $216 billion on drugs in 2021, compared to Medicaid’s $80 billion.Experts say the impact of the AstraZeneca deal on Medicaid spending will likely be limited. “If you look at AstraZeneca's portfolio, I don't think there are a bunch of drugs that exist where that's going to involve them giving a very big discount to Medicaid,” said Craig Garthwaite, a professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, as cited by Reuters.Rena Conti, an associate professor at Boston University, added that while the deal may help AstraZeneca avoid tariffs, it will not move the needle on US rising health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket drug costs.Rena Conti, an associate professor at Boston University, said the deal may protect AstraZeneca from tariffs but is unlikely to make any real difference to rising health insurance premiums or out-of-pocket drug costs in the US.",AstraZeneca will offer some of its drugs at discounts of up to 80% through a new TrumpRx website expected to launch next year.

More hits for China? Trump hints at export controls for Boeing parts; US prez 'surprised' by Beijing's rare earth move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/more-hits-for-china-trump-hints-at-export-controls-for-boeing-parts-us-prez-surprised-by-beijings-rare-earth-move/articleshow/124469034.cms,"



The United States could impose export controls on Boeing aircraft parts following China’s recent restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, President Donald Trump said on Friday.Trump told reporters that Beijing has many Boeing planes and they need parts for those.He expressed surprise at China’s decision, noting his strong personal rapport with President Xi Jinping. “And we are just surprised…we have a very good relationship with President Xi and they did that. This is not something that I instigated. This was just a response to something that they didn’t aim at us, they aimed it at the whole world,” he said.On potential targets for export controls, Trump reiterated, “We have many things, including a big thing is airplane. They (China) have a lot of Boeing planes, and they need parts, and lots of things like that.”The US president has frequently targeted Boeing in his trade policies since taking office, and tensions with China have already affected the planemaker, according to Reuters.Earlier in April, Beijing temporarily halted deliveries of new Boeing jets to Chinese airlines amid a trade dispute.Meanwhile, the airline has secured several major overseas sales following Trump’s visits abroad.Boeing is reportedly negotiating a deal to sell up to 500 jets to China, which would mark its first major Chinese order since Trump’s first term. Analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham Co. said the company would face minimal financial impact even if the deal falls through, describing it as “sandpaper on Boeing’s hide.”China, which once made up a quarter of Boeing’s order book, now accounts for less than 5%. Chinese airlines have at least 222 Boeing jets on order and operate 1,855 planes, mostly the 737 single-aisle model.A ban on parts could also affect CFM International, the GE-Safran joint venture that supplies engines for the 737 MAX, as well as GE engines for the 777 and 787 jets. By comparison, Airbus has 185 Chinese orders and produces A320 jets at its Tianjin facility, Reuters reported.China is also promoting its own aircraft industry with the COMAC C919, a rival to Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 jets. Chinese customers have ordered 365 of these jets, but US export restrictions on Western components have slowed production, with only five delivered by September out of 32 expected.","The United States could impose export controls on Boeing aircraft parts following China’s recent restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, President Donald Trump said on Friday.

Cryptocurrency markets tumbled on Friday as renewed trade tensions between the US and China, alongside a fresh export control move by Donald Trump, rattled investors worldwide.Over the past 24 hours, more than $10 billion were wiped off from the crypto markets, in the largest wave of liquidation since April, according to the Coinglass data, cited by Bloomberg.This slump comes after the US President unveiled a 100% additional tariff on Chinese imports, bringing the total tariffs on China to 130%.

Trump EXPLODES Over Xi’s ‘SINISTER’ Trade Move, ‘Cancels’ Key Meeting Amid China’s Rare Earth Tiff





Wall Street suffered steep losses Friday after US President Donald Trump signaled a sharp escalation in trade tensions with China, threatening to impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports.The S&P 500 fell 2.7% in its worst session since April, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 878 points, or 1.9%, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.6%.Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Trump posted on his social media platform that he was considering “a massive increase of tariffs” on Chinese imports.

He also said, “now there seems to be no reason” to meet with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, after earlier agreeing to do so as part of an upcoming trip to South Korea.The sharp rise in tensions led to widespread losses across Wall Street, with roughly six out of every seven S&P 500 stocks falling.

Gold has broken through multiple records

Gold’s staggering rally in numbers

Gold, which was below $2,000 two years ago, has smashed records by climbing above $4,000. The precious metal has risen more than 50% this year amidst concerns regarding trade, the autonomy of the US Federal Reserve and American fiscal health.

According to Bloomberg, the precious metal is heading towards its strongest yearly gains since the 1970s, an era characterised by swift inflation and the abandonment of the gold standard, which resulted in the metal's value multiplying 15-fold!

The 2025 surge in gold prices stands out as it has occurred without a financial crisis. The 52% increase in futures prices this year is set to exceed similar increases seen during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2007-09 economic downturn, second only to the inflationary period of 1979.

Exchange-traded funds have seen substantial investment activity, with gold-backed ETFs experiencing their most significant monthly influx in over three years during September.

In the Indian market, gold prices have crossed the Rs 1.2 lakh mark on the MCX futures. Overall MCX Gold has given a return of 60.41% on YTD basis also supported by weaker Indian currency pairs which had depreciated by 3.71 % against the dollar.

Gold is on a record-breaking spree - even by its safe haven standards! Gold prices have been rising to new lifetime highs both in the domestic and international markets - smashing records with a bull run not seen in several years.Gold prices surged beyond $4,000 per ounce in international markets this week, reaching this unprecedented level amid growing worries about the United States economy and the US government shutdown, which propelled the ongoing upward trend.The precious metal's price increase also coincided with apprehensions that the technology sector-driven surge, which pushed several stock markets to all-time peaks, might have become excessive, sparking discussions about potential market overvaluation.Central banks around the world are increasing the percentage of gold reserves in their overall foreign exchange reserves. Why are gold prices rising so rapidly? Are investors worried about the future of the dollar? Experts weigh in:According to Wall Street Journal, investors concerned about the stability of major currencies including the dollar are increasingly shifting their investments towards alternative assets such as gold and bitcoin, creating a notable trend that financial analysts refer to as the debasement trade.Experts in the markets have interpreted this investment pattern as an indication that the substantial rise in government borrowing and persistent elevated inflation levels are creating uncertainty regarding the stability of currencies that form the foundation of international financial markets.As per a Bloomberg analysis, gold prices typically surge during periods of economic and political uncertainty. The precious metal surpassed $1,000 per ounce following the global financial crisis, reached $2,000 during the Covid pandemic, and exceeded $3,000 as global markets reacted to the Trump administration's tariff policies in March.The metal has now exceeded $4,000, coinciding with various factors, including US President Donald Trump's confrontation with the Federal Reserve, specifically his threats towards Chair Jerome Powell and attempts to remove Governor Lisa Cook, presenting an unprecedented challenge to the central bank's independence.Central banks around the world are also buying gold in a big way, adding to the rally. Since the global financial crisis, central banks have transformed from net sellers to net buyers of gold.Purchase rates doubled after the 2022 freezing of Russia's foreign-exchange reserves by the US and allies, following Russia's war with Ukraine. This action prompted many central banks to seek portfolio diversification, whilst inflation concerns and potential changes in US treatment of foreign creditors enhanced gold's attractiveness to monetary authorities.Rising geopolitical conflicts have also driven increased interest in safe-haven investments this year, whilst central banks maintain their substantial gold purchasing activities.The surge in gold prices has intensified as investors look to safeguard against possible market disruptions amid the governmental budget standoff in Washington. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's shift towards monetary easing has benefited gold, an asset that generates no interest.Goldman Sachs has increased its gold price projection for December 2026 to $4,900 per ounce, revised upwards from their previous estimate of $4,300.Gold represents a valuable asset independent of institutional confidence, as communicated by the bank to its customers.While Goldman's analysts and various research institutions anticipate continued price increases driven by central-bank acquisitions, Bank of America's historical analysis reveals that since the 1860s, extended periods of gold price appreciation have invariably been succeeded by significant declines.Ray Dalio, the billionaire investor, expressed on Tuesday that gold serves as a more reliable safe-haven asset compared to the US dollar, drawing parallels between the current rally and the 1970s market conditions. These observations followed Citadel's Ken Griffin's comments linking gold's price surge to concerns about American currency stability.""Gold is a very excellent diversifier of the portfolio,"" Dalio stated whilst speaking with Bloomberg's Lisa Abramowicz at the Greenwich Economic Forum in Connecticut. ""So if you were to look at just from the strategic asset allocation mix perspective, you would probably have as the optimal mix something like 15% of your portfolio in gold.""""Gold breaking $4,000 isn't just about fear — it's about reallocation,"" said Charu Chanana, a strategist at Saxo Capital Markets Pte according to a Bloomberg report. ""With economic data on pause and rate cuts on the horizon, real yields are easing, while AI-heavy equities look stretched. Central banks built the base for this rally, but retail and ETFs are now driving the next leg.""""We expect gold to reach a cyclical peak when there is greatest market concern about the outlook for Fed independence,"" Macquarie Bank Ltd. analysts wrote in a September 30 note. ""In the event, however, that a compromised Fed were to make clear policy errors, gold's performance should of course be even stronger.""Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers tells TOI, “US Treasury yields remain on the back foot across the curve as investors slightly increase bets on faster Fed easing in the months ahead, with 111 basis points (bps) of interest rate cuts priced in by December 2026. The CME Fed Watch Tool indicates markets are pricing a 94.6% chance that the Fed will lower rates by 25 bps at the October 29-30 FOMC meeting. ”“With the US shutdown still yet to be resolved, prices are likely to continue upward trajectory where we expect a level of $ 4,105 – 4,150 per oz likely to be tested in spot markets in the short term perspective of 1 – 2 weeks. This could be followed by consolidative moves towards the start of November month. finally translating to an likely upside peak up to Rs. 1,23,800 – 1,24,500 per 10 gm. on MCX futures contract. Any resolution towards the US Shutdown process over the weekend could again bring back profit booking moves in next week,” he adds.","Gold has smashed records by climbing above $4,000.

Trump EXPLODES Over Xi’s ‘SINISTER’ Trade Move, ‘Cancels’ Key Meeting Amid China’s Rare Earth Tiff

Also read:





US president Donald Trump on Friday accused China of taking a “sinister and hostile” step after Beijing imposed sweeping new export controls on rare earth elements, warning that he could respond with a “massive increase of tariffs” on Chinese goods entering the United States.In a post on Truth Social, the US President said “some very strange things are happening in China”, accusing Beijing of becoming “very hostile” by sending letters to countries around the world announcing plans to impose export controls on critical materials used in global manufacturing. “Nobody has ever seen anything like this,” Trump wrote, adding that such a move would “clog the markets, and make life difficult for virtually every country in the world, especially for China. ”The 47th POTUS said he had not spoken to Xi Jinping and no longer saw a reason to meet him at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit later this month, saying the Chinese letters were “especially inappropriate.” He concluded: “I never thought it would come to this, but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come. Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A.Trump said the move came as a “real surprise” given what he described as a previously “very good” six-month relationship with Beijing. “I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!” he said. “There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the world ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘magnets’ and other elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a monopoly position a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least. ”Beijing’s ministry of commerce announced the new rules on Thursday, requiring special approval for any exports of rare earth elements or products that contain even trace amounts of them. China, which dominates global rare earth production and processing, said the curbs are meant to “safeguard national security.” The restrictions are likely to impact key industries, from defence to electronics, that depend on the minerals.Trump suggested the timing of the Chinese announcement, coinciding with what he called a day of “peace in the Middle East,” was no coincidence. “I wonder if that timing was coincidental?” he wrote. He added that he would “financially counter their move,” warning that Washington was preparing tough measures. “One of the policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.”",US President Donald Trump accuses China of taking a ‘sinister and hostile’ step after Beijing imposed sweeping new export controls on rare earth elements.

A months-long calm on Wall Street shattered on Friday after President Donald Trump threatened to sharply raise tariffs on China, triggering a broad market sell-off and pushing the S&P 500 toward its steepest loss since April.The S&P 500 slid 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 622 points and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.7%, as investor sentiment soured following Trump’s remarks on his social media platform Truth Social, AP reported. The president said he was considering “a massive increase of tariffs” on Chinese imports, expressing anger at restrictions China has imposed on exports of rare earths — key materials used in manufacturing electronics and jet engines.“We have been contacted by other countries who are extremely angry at this great trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,” Trump wrote, adding there was “no reason” to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his upcoming trip to South Korea.The flare-up in trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies sent shockwaves across Wall Street, with four out of every five stocks in the S&P 500 declining.Shares of major technology companies including Apple and Nvidia tumbled, alongside smaller firms vulnerable to trade uncertainty.Market analysts said the sell-off also reflected growing concerns about overvaluation, following a nearly 35% surge in the S&P 500 since April that had lifted it to record highs. Critics warned that stock prices have risen far faster than corporate profits, echoing concerns reminiscent of the dot-com bubble in 2000.Levi Strauss was among the day’s biggest decliners, dropping 11.4% despite reporting quarterly earnings that beat analyst expectations. Its full-year forecast met Wall Street estimates, but the stock’s earlier 42% surge this year left little room for disappointment.Oil prices also slid sharply after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect in Gaza, easing fears of supply disruptions in the Middle East.

US tax filing: IRS releases income tax brackets and standard deductions for 2026; here's what has changed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tax-filing-irs-releases-income-tax-brackets-and-standard-deductions-for-2026-heres-what-has-changed/articleshow/124455881.cms,"What’s changing in 2026

Married couples filing jointly will be able to claim $32,200, up from $31,500 in 2025



Single taxpayers can claim $16,100, up from $15,750.



Heads of households will have a deduction of $24,150, according to CBS News.

Understanding your tax

$24,800 taxed at 10% = $2,480



$24,800–$100,800 taxed at 12% = $9,120



$100,800–$117,800 taxed at 22% = $3,740







The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced the new federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for 2026, offering some relief to Americans as they prepare for next year’s tax returns.The IRS usually makes these adjustments in October or November to prevent what's known as “bracket creep.” This occurs when inflation pushes taxpayers into higher income brackets, which can result in them paying more in taxes the following April, though the actual purchasing power has not improved.For the 2026 tax year, which will be filed in 2027, the top federal income tax rate of 37% will apply to individuals with taxable income above $640,600 and married couples filing jointly with income over $768,700.The agency has also raised thresholds for long-term capital gains, estate and gift tax exemptions, and eligibility for the earned income tax credit, ET reported citing CNBC.The standard deduction is also increasing:Seniors could benefit from an extra tax break under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Individuals aged 65 and above may claim a temporary deduction of up to $6,000, available until the end of 2028, for those earning $75,000 or less, or couples earning $150,000 or less.The IRS has warned that an agency-wide furlough will start in October due to a lapse in federal funding caused by the government shutdown. Despite this, taxpayers with an extension deadline of October 15 should continue filing as usual.“Taxpayers should continue to file, deposit, and pay federal income taxes as they normally would; the lapse in appropriations does not change Federal Income Tax responsibilities,” an IRS spokesperson told CBS News.In the US, taxation is progressive, meaning that they increase as the income rises. They come in 7 brackets: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%.To see how the changes affect you, consider a married couple earning $150,000. Subtracting the 2026 standard deduction of $32,200 leaves $117,800 in taxable income. They fall into the 22% marginal tax bracket, but their effective tax rate is lower:This totals $15,340 in federal income tax, resulting in an effective rate of 13%.","Married couples filing jointly will be able to claim $32,200, up from $31,500 in 2025.

China on Friday announced that it will start imposing “special port fees” on ships built or operated by the US.According to the transport ministery, the fees will take effect at Chinese ports from October 14 when US ships arriving in China will pay 400 yuan ($56) per net tonne, rising to 640 yuan in April. The fees will also undergo more increases annually.The ministry clarified that the charges apply to each voyage to China, not each individual port, and no ship will be charged more than five times a year.The move follows Washington’s April fees on Chinese-built and operated ships and the charges will take effect the same day as US port fees. US imposed these charges after an investigation into China’s shipbuilding sector, initiated under the previous US administration.A spokesperson for China’s transport ministry described the charges as a “legitimate measure to safeguard the lawful rights and interests of Chinese shipping companies.”They also said, “We urge the US side to immediately correct its wrongful practices and cease its unwarranted suppression of China's shipping industry.”","US ships arriving in China will pay 400 yuan ($56) per net tonne, rising to 640 yuan in April.

Why can China fly over Russia but US can’t?

US’ new proposal

Effects on market

US-China tensions





The Trump administration has made another attempt to ensure fairness for US workers, asking China to bar its airplanes from flying over Russia as it puts American airlines at a disadvantage.The US government on Thursday presented a proposal to stop Chinese airlines from flying over Russia on routes to and from the United States, arguing that this gives them a major competitive edge over American carriers.The US transportation department said that the current arrangement was “unfair and has resulted in substantial adverse competitive effects on US air carriers,” Reuters reported.By flying through Russian airspace, Chinese airlines can cut travel time, save fuel, and lower costs.American carriers lost access to Russian skies in March 2022, when Washington banned Russian flights over US territory after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.Russia responded by blocking US and many other foreign airlines from its airspace.Chinese airlines, however, were not restricted and have been using this advantage to grow their international market share.The new proposal would apply the same overflight restrictions to Chinese carriers operating passenger routes under US-issued foreign air carrier permits.Cargo-only services would not be affected.If approved, the rule could impact US flights operated by Air China (601111.SS), China Eastern (600115.SS), China Southern (600029.SS) and Xiamen Airlines.Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific (0293.HK) flies over Russia on its New York–Hong Kong route, but it was not named in the order, according to Reuters.Shares in China’s three biggest airlines slipped slightly on Friday after the news. Air China fell 1.3%, China Southern dropped 1.8% and China Eastern eased 0.3% by midday. The state-owned carriers have posted five straight years of losses since the pandemic.The move adds to wider US–China economic tensions. Earlier, Beijing tightened export controls on rare earth minerals, key for some US industries. Meanwhile, Boeing is in discussions to sell up to 500 aircraft to China, a potential breakthrough after years of stalled orders.US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet in South Korea later this month to discuss trade and other issues.Chinese airlines have been given two days to respond to the proposal. A final order could take effect as soon as November.In May 2023, the US allowed more flights by Chinese airlines after they agreed to avoid Russian airspace on new routes. Last year, Washington capped Chinese passenger flights at 50 round trips a week, backing away from further increases after lobbying by US airlines and unions. Before the pandemic in early 2020, both sides allowed more than 150 weekly round trips.Some US airlines have told the Trump administration that direct flights from the East Coast to China are not financially viable without access to Russian airspace. Longer routes mean some planes must fly with empty seats and reduced cargo to manage fuel limits.","The US government on Thursday presented a proposal to stop Chinese airlines from flying over Russia on routes to and from the United States.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

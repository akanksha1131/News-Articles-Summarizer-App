LPG Price Hike: Commercial cylinder becomes Rs 111 costlier — check new prices for major cities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lpg-price-hike-commercial-cylinder-becomes-rs-111-costlier-check-new-prices-for-major-cities/articleshow/126284216.cms,"File photo (ANI image)

Oil marketing companies have raised the prices of commercial LPG cylinders from today, reversing recent reductions. The increase is set to push up operating costs for hotels, restaurants and other service providers across the country.The price of a 19-kg commercial LPG cylinder has been hiked by Rs 111 nationwide. In Delhi, the retail price now stands at Rs 1,691.50, up from Rs 1,580.50.Mumbai saw prices rise from Rs 1,531.50 to Rs 1,642.50, while Kolkata’s rate increased from Rs 1,684 to Rs 1,795. Chennai recorded a sharp rise in prices, climbing from Rs 1,739.50 to Rs 1,849.50. Prices of 5-kg free trade LPG (FTL) cylinders were also raised by Rs 27.The increase is expected to significantly impact operating expenses for businesses that rely heavily on cooking gas, particularly in the hospitality and catering sectors, which had seen some relief last month due to successive reductions.Household consumers, however, have been spared from the latest revision. Domestic LPG cylinder prices (14.2 kg) remain unchanged, continuing at Rs 853, where they have stayed since a Rs 50 hike in April last year.The hike comes after a phase of moderation in commercial LPG prices. Since April 2025, commercial cylinder rates had seen six reductions amounting to a cumulative cut of Rs 223 per cylinder, including small rollbacks in November and December.In contrast, Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) prices were reduced from January 1, offering some respite to airlines after months of elevated fuel costs. In Delhi, ATF prices were cut from Rs 864.35 to Rs 791.48 per kilolitre, a move expected to ease pressure on airline operating costs, where fuel accounts for nearly 40% of total expenses, according to ET. Indian Oil Corporation , Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum revise LPG and ATF prices on the first day of every month, based on international fuel prices and currency movements.","The price of a 19-kg commercial LPG cylinder has been hiked by Rs 111 nationwide.

Nifty is expected to remain range-bound with an upward bias, oscillating within the 25,700–26,300 corridor in the near term. The index is positioned at a technical inflection point, where a decisive move outside this band is likely to define the next directional leg.A sustained close above 26,300 would act as a bullish trigger, paving the way for a potential advance toward the 26,500 zone in subsequent sessions.On the downside, 26,000 serves as immediate support. A stronger demand zone is placed between 25,700–25,800, which coincides with the 50-day EMA, recent swing lows, and a key retracement of the prior up-move.Maintaining trade above this support cluster is essential to protect the positive momentum of the past three months and keep the broader bullish structure intact.Bank Nifty continues to outperform the Nifty, displaying clear relative strength, and is in the process of base-building within the 58,500–60,100 band over the near term.A decisive breakout with follow-through above 59,500, which also coincides with an intermediate supply zone, could trigger fresh momentum toward the lifetime high region around 60,100 in the coming sessions.The strong up-move of the past two months remains well anchored within an ascending price channel, highlighting persistent accumulation even at higher levels.On the downside, the 58,300–58,600 zone offers robust support, converging with the 50-day EMA and the earlier breakout base. As long as the index defends this support cluster, the medium-term bullish structure remains intact.The counter has established a strong uptrend, marked by a multi-month breakout and a consistent higher high–higher low formation, highlighting sustained buying interest. Prices continue to hold above major weekly moving averages, with rising volumes lending credibility to the ongoing strength.On the downside, 145 acts as immediate support, followed by 140. On the upside, resistance is placed near 170, which coincides with the 161.8% Fibonacci extension of the prior swing, and further at 175. Corrective declines toward the average should be viewed as accumulation opportunities.Momentum indicators remain robust; although the RSI above 70 indicates an overbought condition, the broader trend is intact, and any temporary consolidation is likely to be constructive rather than trend-reversing.The stock is trading above its key moving averages and has established a base formation on the weekly timeframe, indicating improving price stability. The weekly chart reflects a higher high–higher low structure, confirming a strengthening trend.Immediate support is seen at 245, followed by 240, while short term resistance is placed near 275, with further upside potential toward 292.From a momentum perspective, ADX at 28 signals a strengthening trend, while the weekly RSI at 63 suggests bullish dominance.","Nifty is expected to remain range-bound with an upward bias, oscillating within the 25,700–26,300 corridor in the near term.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, rallied strongly in trade on Tuesday. While Nifty50 registered a lifetime closing high, BSE Sensex rose around 600 points. Nifty50 closed the day at 26,328.55, up 182 points or 0.70%. BSE Sensex ended at 85,762.01, up 573 points or 0.67%.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The impressive 25.8 % YoY increase in passenger vehicles sales in December bodes well for the auto industry. More importantly, this data confirms the growth momentum in the economy. It has to be watched whether this growth sustains, albeit at a slower pace, going forward. It is hugely important that the growth momentum in the economy sustains, because that alone can ensure the much needed earnings growth that the market needs to remain resilient and gradually move up. ”“The positive news about the auto industry is largely in the price. A sector that lagged last year was the consumer durables industry, which has the potential to catch up, going forward. The beneficial impact of the interest rate cuts and GST cuts are yet to reflect in the demand for consumer durables.In the short-term, this is one segment that has good prospects.”Auto stocks gained, helping lift broader markets, while weakness in select FMCG names capped overall upside. In contrast, ITC extended its sharp decline under sustained pressure following a wave of brokerage downgrades that warned of earnings headwinds stemming from the government’s recent increase in cigarette taxes. ITC’s weakness dragged the fast-moving consumer goods index down 1.4%.On the institutional side, Foreign Institutional Investors sold equities worth about Rs 3,269 crore on January 1, while Domestic Institutional Investors provided some support, buying shares worth Rs 1,526 crore.Globally, equities began 2026 on a firmer note in thin holiday trading, extending the late-December rally. Investors are looking ahead to a year expected to test the strength of the AI-driven market boom, navigate a leadership transition at the US Federal Reserve and contend with potentially higher volatility under President Donald Trump. Low liquidity kept moves across asset classes muted, with markets in Japan and China closed and several Asian exchanges reopening after the New Year break.Precious metals continued to build on their strong momentum. Spot gold climbed 0.9% to $4,351.70 an ounce, while silver surged 2% to $72.63. Gold recorded its biggest annual gain in 46 years in 2025, while silver and platinum posted record increases, driven by Federal Reserve rate cuts, geopolitical tensions, central bank purchases and exchange-traded fund inflows.In equity markets, MSCI’s Asia-Pacific index excluding Japan advanced 0.66%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.24%. US futures traded higher, with S&P 500 futures up 0.29% and Nasdaq futures gaining 0.36%. European futures were mixed, as Euro Stoxx 50 futures slipped 0.5% while FTSE futures edged up 0.1%.Oil prices also edged higher in the first trading session of the year, rebounding modestly after logging their steepest annual fall since 2020. The move came amid renewed geopolitical concerns following Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil infrastructure and increased US pressure on Venezuela’s exports.

Gold futures on MCX are trading near ₹1,35,690 after a phase of consolidation, with price action indicating base formation above key intraday supports.

This indicates improving short-term momentum and the possibility of a trend reversal if prices sustain above ₹1,36,000.Gold is consolidating near the mid-Bollinger band after defending the lower band successfully.

"Coloured diamonds shine brighter: Ultra rich chase pink, blue stones — what’s driving the demand?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/coloured-diamonds-shine-brighter-ultra-rich-chase-pink-blue-stones-whats-driving-the-demand/articleshow/126315892.cms,"Why are coloured diamonds shining more?



Ultra wealthy Indians are increasingly placing their bets on pink, blue and yellow diamonds, embracing the rare stones as both eye-catching statement jewellery and long-term investment assets. Coloured diamonds,far rarer than conventional white diamonds, have seen demand spiked by 20%-25% over the past year, even as prices continue to climb.According to jewellers and traders, since the pandemic period, India has become one of the fastest-growing markets for coloured diamonds, fuelled by a new generation of globally exposed and asset-conscious ultra high net-worth individuals (HNIs), ET reported.Conventional and coloured diamonds fall in completely different price categories. Unlike traditional white diamonds, which typically cost between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 7 lakh a carat depending on cut and clarity, coloured stones command a significant premium. Pink diamonds can range from Rs 15 lakh to as much as Rs 5 crore a carat, while blue diamonds are priced between Rs 25 lakh and Rs 5 crore, according to ET. Meanwhile, yellow diamonds, considered more accessible entry points into the segment, are priced comparatively lower, between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh a carat.Beyond their visual appeal, price appreciation is playing a major role in driving demand. With no new mines coming online, coloured diamonds are increasingly being viewed as alternative investments amid rising scarcity.In rupee terms, prices of pink diamonds have increased tenfold over the past two decades, while blue diamonds have risen six to seven times. Yellow diamonds, meanwhile, have roughly doubled in value over the same period.Darshit Hirani, cofounder of P Hirani Exports, told ET, that “demand is also driven by the fact that celebrities and businessmen across the globe are embracing coloured diamonds for weddings and other special occasions. Wealthy Indians want to be part of this global trend.”He further noted that interest is no longer limited to major metros. “An interesting trend we are seeing is that HNIs from tier II cities are showing interest in coloured diamonds and are buying yellow diamonds as their first purchase,” Hirani said.Hirani, who has worked exclusively with coloured diamonds for over 40 years, said buying patterns vary by age group. Larger stones of one to two carats are typically being purchased by HNIs aged 45 and above, while smaller and mid-sized stones are attracting younger buyers from affluent families or those in higher salary brackets.The post-pandemic shift in consumer behaviour has also been noted by retailers. Ishu Datwani, founder of Mumbai-based Anmol Jewellers, said spending on rare stones has risen sharply since Covid. “Indians have become globetrotters...(exposed to) fine jewellery brands such as Chopard and Cartier. They now want us to create pieces that resonate with their evolved tastes,” he said. Datwani added that there has been a strong increase in demand for fancy yellow diamonds sourced in rough form from Australia, Russia and South Africa, before being cut and polished in Surat.Globally, coloured diamonds are also emerging as standout performers at auctions, particularly in Asia, where their rarity and investment appeal have made them highly sought after. A July report by the Natural Diamond Council (NDC) estimated that the wholesale value of fancy colour diamonds entering the market in 2024 exceeded $4.5 billion, citing data from the Israel-based Fancy Colour Research Foundation (FCRF).Industry executives estimate that coloured diamonds account for less than 1% of global diamond production, with only a handful of mines producing them in limited quantities. The closure of Rio Tinto’s Argyle mine in 2020, once responsible for more than 90% of the world’s pink and red diamonds, has further tightened supply. With no consistent alternative source emerging since, dealers say scarcity has intensified, forcing buyers to compete aggressively for the remaining inventory, often at any cost.","Coloured diamonds,far rarer than conventional white diamonds, have seen demand spiked by 20%-25% over the past year. India has become one of the fastest- growing markets for coloured diamonds, fuelled by a new generation of asset- conscious ultra high net-worth individuals.

The pinch

MUMBAI: Thinking of buying an air-conditioner in the new year or getting some fancy bathware or copper-based kitchen utensils to add to the aesthetics of your home? You may have to pay more, as the red metal used in several household products has surged in recent months. Copper prices surpassed a record $12,000 per tonne last month, recording its biggest annual gain since 2009, Bloomberg data showed.Companies across durables, cookware and bathware, for whom copper and related materials like brass account for a large share of their commodity basket, are set to raise prices to protect margins.Many companies procure copper through a mix of imports and local sourcing. Global price movements weigh on the overall pricing.With copper and aluminium prices hitting record highs, we will increase prices by 5-7% in the appliance and cookware category. Copper is a vital material for our most popular appliances, like the nutri-blend and our high-performance mixer grinders. The high prices are putting pressure on margins across the entire appliance industry,” said Ravi Saxena, CEO & founder at cookware brand Wonderchef.While cheaper alternatives can be looked at wherever feasible, it is not always an option all brands want to go for.For instance, in case of certain key components such as motors that power appliances, copper is still the ‘gold standard,’ said Saxena.On MCX, copper prices touched nearly Rs 1,300 per kg on Friday evening, up over 6%.“Brass is a key material for the bathware industry. Since the start of the financial year, the price of brass hasCopper, ‘gold standard’ for some appliances, surges to `1,300/kgrisen by 15-18% and our suppliers have raised their rates. Companies cannot absorb the high costs beyond a point.,” said Shrivatsa Somany, head at Somany Bathware. The industry has already raised prices by about 12% in the first two quarters of the financial year.Prices for copper and other industrial metals such as aluminium and lithium rallied last year as interest rates declined, the dollar weakened and expectations for China’s economic growth improved. Supply disruptions, policy changes and massive spending on AI also boosted prices, analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note on Dec 11, forecasting the London Metals Exchange (LME) copper price to average $10,710 (per tonne) in the first half of 2026.“The overall impact on AC category input cost for us has gone up by 8-10%. Currently, all newly produced ACs shall have the cost impact of copper as well as energy table change cost, which will lead to a 7-8% increase in prices of ACs,” said Kamal Nandi, business head and EVP, appliances business at Godrej Enterprises Group","Copper prices surpassed a record $12,000 per tonne last month, recording its biggest annual gain since 2009.

What's being offered

NEW DELHI: The commerce department on Friday unveiled a new interest subsidy mechanism targeted at MSMEs, along with a corpus to guarantee loans to small businesses that export.The interest subsidy scheme, which has an allocation of nearly Rs 5,181 crore spread over six years starting the current fiscal, will offer a 2.75% subsidy on loans with a reset planned every six months. The extent of subsidy will be linked to the repo rate as well as interest rates in other competing economies, a senior official told reporters, adding that the move is meant to address a critical handicap faced by small businesses.Besides, an incentive will be offered to exporters selling goods in new and emerging markets, with the details of the scheme to be announced in the coming weeks along with initiatives to develop other financial tools such as factoring. For years, Indian businesses have complained of lack of access to credit and higher interest rates as major impediments.Officials said that currently, small businesses borrow at 9-12% to meet their export credit requirement and the subsidy will provide some relief.Wiser by its earlier experience, this time, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade has capped the annual interest subsidy assistance at Rs 50 lakh per businesses with 75% of the product lines, especially the labour-intensive ones, eligible. The second scheme on collateral support has a corpus of Rs 2,114 crore, again spread over six years, with govt hoping to leverage it 30-35 times in helping facilitate the flow of loans of Rs 60,000-65,000 crore.

Oman: Ministry of Health makes premarital medical exams mandatory for couples,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/oman-makes-premarital-medical-exams-mandatory-for-couples/articleshow/126298540.cms,"Premarital medical exams are now mandatory in Oman to ensure healthier families and informed marriages/Representative Image





From the start of 2026, marriage in Oman entered a new phase. A Royal Decree that came into force on January 1 now makes premarital medical examinations compulsory for all Omanis, placing public health and informed family planning at the center of the marriage process.The Ministry of Health has begun implementing mandatory premarital medical examinations in accordance with Royal Decree No. 111/2025 on the Regulation of Premarital Medical Examination, issued by Sultan Haitham bin Tarik. As of January 1, 2026, completion of the examination is a basic condition for concluding a marriage contract involving an Omani citizen.The requirement applies in all cases, whether the marriage takes place inside or outside the Sultanate, and whether one or both parties are Omani. Even when one party is non-Omani, the examination remains mandatory. Marriage officiants are prohibited from concluding a contract unless both parties present a valid premarital medical examination certificate.The screening focuses on detecting carriers of hereditary blood disorders, specifically sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, as well as infectious diseases included in the programme: hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV/AIDS.The Ministry said the measure is part of broader preventive efforts to limit the spread of genetic, hereditary, and infectious diseases in society.According to the Ministry, early detection reduces the likelihood of children being born with hereditary blood disorders and helps ease health, social, psychological, and financial pressures on families. It also reduces strain on healthcare institutions and blood banks, prevents the transmission of infectious diseases between spouses and from mother to fetus, and enables timely access to preventive and therapeutic care.Premarital screening has been available in Oman since 1999 but was optional, with participation reaching only 42 percent in 2025. Authorities said this low uptake led to the decision to make the programme mandatory. The Ministry clarified that the requirement does not interfere with a couple’s choice to marry but ensures both parties are fully informed through testing and medical counselling.Examinations are available at government primary healthcare institutions and at accredited private facilities. Results are shared only with the individuals concerned, treated with strict confidentiality, and followed by counselling. A completion certificate is issued electronically and linked to the Supreme Judicial Council’s Notary Public platform. Violators face imprisonment ranging from ten days to six months, and or fines between 100 and 1,000 Omani riyals.","Royal Decree that came into force on January 1 now makes premarital medical examinations compulsory for all Omanis.

EV race: Tesla loses top spot after second year of delivery decline; BYD overtakes in global sales,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ev-race-tesla-loses-top-spot-after-second-year-of-delivery-decline-byd-overtakes-in-global-sales/articleshow/126309001.cms,"Tesla Launches First Showroom in India at Mumbai's BKC | Cheapest EV Model Y Costs...

Tesla has lost its position as the world’s largest electric vehicle maker after deliveries fell for a second consecutive year in 2025, weighed down by intensifying competition and weakening demand in key markets, AP reported.The US electric carmaker said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, a decline of 9 per cent from the previous year. Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million electric vehicles last year, has now overtaken Tesla as the world’s biggest EV manufacturer.Fourth-quarter deliveries stood at 418,227 vehicles, below the 440,000 units expected by analysts polled by FactSet. Sales in the quarter were also hit by the expiry of a $7,500 US federal tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.Tesla shares were largely unchanged in early trade on Friday at $450.27, as investors continued to look beyond near-term sales pressures. The stock ended 2025 up about 11 per cent, reflecting optimism around the company’s longer-term strategy.Despite declining vehicle sales, investors are betting on chief executive Elon Musk ’s push to reposition Tesla as a leader in autonomous mobility and robotics. Musk has repeatedly said that future growth will be driven by robotaxi services, energy storage and humanoid robots designed for use in homes and factories.The fourth quarter marked the first full period of sales for stripped-down, lower-priced versions of the Model Y and Model 3, unveiled in early October to revive demand. The new Model Y is priced just under $40,000, while the cheaper Model 3 starts below $37,000. These models are expected to help Tesla compete more aggressively with Chinese EV makers in Europe and Asia.Looking ahead, analysts expect pressure on financial performance to continue in the near term. For the fourth-quarter results due in late January, Tesla is forecast to report a 3 per cent drop in revenue and a nearly 40 per cent fall in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts, however, expect sales and profits to stabilise and begin recovering as 2026 progresses.Musk has argued that falling car sales are less critical to Tesla’s long-term outlook, as the company pivots towards new technologies and business lines. Supporting that vision, shareholders approved a potentially large new pay package for Musk at the company’s annual meeting in November.Musk, already the world’s richest individual, also received a boost last month when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed an earlier ruling that had voided a $55 billion pay package awarded to him by Tesla in 2018.","Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million electric vehicles last year, has now overtaken Tesla as the world’s biggest EV manufacturer.

Net worth: $622.7 billion

Did you know that the world’s wealthiest and richest 500 people added a whopping $2.2 trillion to their wealth in 2025? The rise was a result of powerful rallies across global markets ranging from stocks and digital assets to precious metals, data from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. As a result, the aggregate net worth expanded to $11.9 trillion in 2025.Technology billionaires were at the forefront of the advance, with sustained enthusiasm around artificial intelligence driving gains in US mega-cap shares. Roughly 25% of the total increase tracked by Bloomberg’s index was generated by just eight people.Among them were Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk , Alphabet co-founder Larry Page and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Even so, their share of overall gains was smaller than a year earlier, when the same group accounted for 43%.This surge got a booster shot after Donald Trump ’s victory in the US presidential election in late 2024, while concerns over tariffs caused only a brief interruption. In April, a sharp market selloff triggered the largest single-day erosion of billionaire wealth since the pandemic, but the setback proved temporary.At the start of the year, Musk stood clearly apart as the most prominent figure among the ultra-wealthy.He stepped into the political arena in a significant way after contributing close to $300 million to Trump’s re-election bid and spent much of early 2025 in Washington, DC, leading efforts aimed at reducing government spending.By year-end, however, it was Ellison who emerged as the standout. A sharp rise in Oracle’s share price, driven by increased investment in artificial intelligence by the cloud computing firm, briefly pushed him past Musk in September to become the world’s richest person. Although Oracle stock later retreated by about 40% from its highs, Ellison remained in the spotlight due to his role in the Paramount Skydance Corp. offer, led by his son David Ellison, to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.The wealth expansion was not limited to the US. While the S&P 500 Index gained 17% for the year through December 30, it lagged behind a 22% rise in Britain’s FTSE 100 and a 29% advance in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index.Performance across other asset classes was even stronger. Precious metals delivered one of their strongest showings in decades as investors sought safety, while copper and rare earths gained strategic importance amid geopolitical tensions. This boosted the fortunes of major commodity holders such as Australian mining tycoon Gina Rinehart and Chile’s Luksic family by billions of dollars.Cryptocurrencies also appeared set to outperform equities for much of the year. Bitcoin jumped to record levels following Trump’s election victory and extended its rally after the administration rolled out policies seen as supportive of the sector. That momentum reversed sharply in October, when a steep selloff erased all earlier gains and more, sharply cutting the wealth of crypto-focused billionaires including the Winklevoss twins, Changpeng Zhao and Michael Saylor.At 81, the Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has stepped more deeply into the company’s daily operations, steering its aggressive and highly leveraged expansion into artificial intelligence infrastructure. Ellison’s personal wealth jumped sharply on September 10, rising by $89 billion in a single day after Oracle posted blockbuster quarterly results linked to its AI strategy. This marked the largest one-day increase in net worth recorded by Bloomberg’s wealth index at the time.Beyond technology, Ellison has been channeling capital into the media space, including personally backing the equity component of his son David’s $108 billion hostile bid for Warner Bros. Oracle’s ambition to play a central role in the proposed $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure initiative, along with plans to take an ownership stake in TikTok’s US business, could further influence Ellison’s fortune well into 2026 and beyond.Elon Musk emerged as the largest political contributor during the 2024 election cycle and spent much of the spring in Washington, where his Department of Government Efficiency drove deep budget cuts and large-scale workforce reductions across federal agencies. That period weighed on his personal wealth, as Tesla shares came under pressure, partly reflecting consumer backlash against his political involvement.His fortunes improved after he exited the White House following a very public rift with Donald Trump. A recent insider transaction at SpaceX lifted the company’s valuation to the highest level ever for a private firm, pushing Musk’s net worth past the $600 billion mark for the first time. Separately, Tesla investors approved a revised pay package that positions him to potentially become the world’s first trillionaire, provided the electric vehicle maker achieves an ambitious set of performance milestones in the years ahead.Australia’s wealthiest individual emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the global push to secure access to strategically critical rare-earth minerals. Through her privately owned firm Hancock Prospecting, Rinehart has built the largest rare-earth holdings outside China, placing her at the center of an intensifying geopolitical contest over materials that underpin industries such as semiconductors and electric vehicles.Her influence has extended beyond mining. Rinehart has appeared at events hosted at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and holds an investment in Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the listed company that operates the social media platform Truth Social. In the three months through June 30, she expanded that stake by roughly two-thirds.Since launching his campaign for a second term, Donald Trump and his family have pursued a wide range of commercial ventures that have significantly boosted their collective wealth, reaching levels rarely seen in modern US political history. Despite a recent pullback, the family’s fortune has risen by around 70% over the past 15 months.In the period leading up to Trump’s second inauguration, he and First Lady Melania Trump promoted two memecoins branded with their names. While those tokens initially surged before retreating, the Trump-branded coin alone has contributed more than $200 million to the family’s net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Weeks before the 2024 election, Trump also helped launch the crypto platform World Liberty Financial alongside his sons. Since then, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have expanded into digital asset ventures, including cryptocurrency mining company American Bitcoin Corp.A major holding for the family, their stake in Trump Media, jumped in value in December following the announcement of a merger with nuclear fusion firm TAE Technologies, though the shares remain more than 70% below their January peak. Trump also notched a legal win in August when an appeals court overturned a $464 million civil fraud penalty, even as it upheld findings that he had violated the law by overstating the value of assets such as the Mar-a-Lago resort.Manuel Villar, who previously held the title of the Philippines’ richest individual, suffered a dramatic erosion of wealth after shares of his real estate firm, Golden MV Holdings Inc., collapsed shortly after trading resumed in November. The stock fell by more than 80% within days of the end of a six-month suspension, wiping out over $18 billion from Villar’s fortune.The trading halt had been imposed when Golden MV failed to submit financial statements following disclosures that the company had purchased a parcel of land from Villar for $93 million, only to later mark its value at over $23 billion. Adding to the pressure, Villar earlier this month exited his entire holding in water utility PrimeWater, selling the stake to retail magnate Lucio Co. PrimeWater had come under government scrutiny in July over alleged “irregularities. ”The long-anticipated revival in US initial public offerings suffered a setback with the underwhelming market debut of liquefied natural gas exporter Venture Global Inc. After several slow years for new listings, the company’s January IPO was widely seen as a potential catalyst for a stronger issuance pipeline, supported by a pro-business administration and a sizable backlog of deals.Ahead of the flotation, co-founders Bob Pender and Mike Sabel were expected to each hold equity stakes valued at close to $30 billion, as Venture Global was positioned to deliver the largest energy IPO in more than a decade. That optimism quickly faded. Weak investor appetite forced the company to scale back the offering, and the share price has since plunged more than 70%, weighed down by underwhelming quarterly results and the loss of a major arbitration case against BP Plc, one of its largest customers.For much of the first half of the year, Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. stood out as a major beneficiary of the cryptocurrency boom. Digital assets surged to record levels following Donald Trump’s election victory in November 2024 and extended those gains as the new administration implemented a series of policies supportive of the sector. Strategy was at the forefront of the so-called crypto treasury approach, accumulating large quantities of Bitcoin on its balance sheet while repeatedly issuing equity to fund further purchases.That strategy delivered outsized gains through early October, when Bitcoin reached new peaks. Momentum then reversed. A sharp pullback in the cryptocurrency triggered a steep sell-off in Strategy’s shares, which fell by more than 50%, erasing nearly $6 billion from Saylor’s wealth compared with its earlier high.Wang Xing, co-founder and chairman of Meituan, experienced a significant drop in personal wealth during 2025 as pressures mounted on China’s leading food delivery company. His net worth slid close to 31% after Meituan reported its first quarterly loss in nearly three years in November.The setback came despite a strong year for Chinese equities, with the Shanghai Composite Index rising 18%. Meituan has been weighed down by softer domestic consumer spending and intensifying competition from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. To counter slowing growth at home, the company has accelerated its push into international markets, recently expanding operations into Brazil and the Middle East.","The world’s wealthiest and richest 500 people added a whopping $2.2 trillion to their wealth in 2025.

"Global investing outlook 2026: Why investors may look beyond the US; how AI, rate cuts and a softer dollar will shape returns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-investing-outlook-2026-why-investors-may-look-beyond-the-us-how-ai-rate-cuts-and-a-softer-dollar-will-shape-returns/articleshow/126290387.cms,"Global investment opportunities are set to widen meaningfully in 2026 as easing monetary policy, a weakening US dollar and profit growth outside the United States reshape capital flows, according to Franklin Templeton report.The asset manager report titled 'Global Investment Outlook 2026 and Beyond' said that lobal markets are entering a phase where returns are likely to “broaden” across regions and asset classes, moving away from the US-centric leadership seen in recent years, even as American equities — particularly technology stocks — remain resilient.""“In 2026, we foresee broadening opportunities across global capital markets, driven by attractive profits growth outside the United States and by global monetary policy easing,” the report said.Franklin Templeton identified three cyclical forces defining the near-term landscape — broadening, steepening and weakening. Broadening reflects expanding opportunities across geographies and asset classes; steepening points to yield curves as short-term rates fall faster than long-term yields; and weakening refers to the US dollar, which the firm expects to remain under pressure.Yield curves are likely to steepen as central banks cut policy rates, reducing the appeal of cash and pushing investors towards equities, credit and longer-duration fixed income.“Falling short-term interest rates will incentivise investors to move out of cash holdings and into risk assets,” the report said, adding that cyclically sensitive sectors such as financials, industrials and smaller companies could benefit.The US Federal Reserve resumed rate cuts in September 2025 after a nine-month pause and is expected to continue easing into the first half of 2026, even as inflation remains above target. Franklin Templeton said this policy backdrop reinforces its broadening thesis, encouraging investors to look beyond traditional safe assets.The US dollar has already fallen about 10% on a trade-weighted basis this year, and the report suggested the decline may not be over. “Weakening of the US dollar tends to reinforce a broadening of returns across capital markets, by region, sector, and asset class,” it said, highlighting positive implications for emerging market debt and equities.Looking beyond 2026, Franklin Templeton outlined three long-term themes likely to shape portfolios over the coming half-decade — the Age of Intelligence, the mainstreaming of private markets and an era of big government.Artificial intelligence remains central to the long-term investment case, but the report stressed that AI deployment is still in its early stages. “Its contribution to growth, social welfare, and investment returns is just beginning,” Franklin Templeton said, pointing to continued opportunities in data centres, advanced semiconductors and AI-enabling infrastructure.A key constraint — and opportunity — lies in energy. “One of the most compelling investment themes is the need to ‘feed the beast’ to sate AI’s vast energy appetite,” the report noted, flagging rising electricity demand and spillover benefits for engineering, industrial metals and power infrastructure.Private markets are also expected to play a larger role as investors search for income and diversification in a lower-rate environment. Franklin Templeton identified commercial real estate debt, infrastructure and secondary private equity offerings as preferred areas as cash yields decline.At the same time, the report struck a note of caution, warning that rising government intervention could dampen returns. “We have entered an era of big and intrusive government, which risks lowering returns and increasing risk across capital markets over the remainder of this decade,” it said.Franklin Templeton said investors will need to adapt portfolios to a world where leadership is more dispersed, policy uncertainty remains elevated and innovation — particularly in technology, private assets and digital finance — continues to be the dominant long-term driver of returns.","Global investment opportunities are set to widen meaningfully in 2026, according to Franklin Templeton report.

Healthcare shock for Americans! Medical insurance subsidies expired; millions stuck with hiked premiums,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/healthcare-shock-for-americans-medical-insurance-subsidies-expired-millions-stuck-with-hiked-premiums/articleshow/126288936.cms,"Millions of Americans face higher healthcare costs as enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits expired on January 1, 2026, despite efforts from both Republicans and Democrats to find a solution. The expiration affects over 20 million people who rely on these subsidies, with average premium costs more than doubling for most enrollees.The subsidies were part of the original Affordable Care Act passed during the Obama administration and were later enhanced during the Covid-19 pandemic to boost financial assistance for those already eligible and to expand coverage to more Americans. First introduced in 2021 as a temporary pandemic-era measure, the enhanced subsidies were extended by Democrats in power at the time, pushing their expiration to the start of 2026. The subsidies helped lower-income enrollees get free coverage and ensured higher earners paid no more than 8.5 per cent of their income for health insurance.The political battle to save these subsidies led to a 43-day government shutdown, but the two opposing parties could reach an agreement. A House vote expected in January 2026 offers another chance, though success remains uncertain.""It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,"" said Katelin Provost, a 37-year-old single mom whose monthly premium is jumping from $85 to nearly $750, as quoted by the Associated Press.Stan Clawson, a 49-year-old freelance filmmaker in Salt Lake City living with paralysis, saw his monthly premiums increase from $350 to nearly $500. He's choosing to absorb the cost due to his medical needs.Health experts warn that many younger, healthier Americans might drop coverage altogether due to the higher costs. The Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund predict about 4.8 million Americans will lose coverage in 2026. This could make the program more expensive for older, sicker participants who remain.Some affected individuals are making tough choices. Provost plans to drop her own coverage while maintaining insurance for her four-year-old daughter if Congress doesn't restore the subsidies soon.Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old enrollee from Wisconsin, expressed frustration with the political gridlock: ""Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it. They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.""The issue remains particularly important as the country enters a crucial midterm election year, with healthcare affordability ranking high among voters' concerns.","Extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits expired on January 1, 2026.

Euro switch: Bulgaria joins the euro nearly two decades after EU entry; cheers mix with fears over prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/euro-switch-bulgaria-joins-the-euro-nearly-two-decades-after-eu-entry-cheers-mix-with-fears-over-prices/articleshow/126286270.cms,"Bulgaria on Thursday adopted the euro as its official currency, becoming the 21st country to join the eurozone, a long-anticipated milestone that comes almost 20 years after the Balkan nation entered the European Union, but one that has exposed deep political and public divisions.At midnight, Bulgaria formally gave up the lev, which had been in use since the late 19th century, marking the transition with projections of Bulgarian euro coins on the central bank’s building in Sofia. The country of 6.4 million people joined the eurozone amid New Year celebrations that blended optimism with anxiety over inflation and political instability, AFP reported.“I warmly welcome Bulgaria to the euro family,” European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde said, describing the euro as a “powerful symbol” of “shared values and collective strength”.For some Bulgarians, the switch was tangible and immediate. “Great! It works!” said Dimitar, a 43-year-old, after withdrawing 100 euros from an ATM shortly after midnight.Successive Bulgarian governments have backed euro adoption, arguing it would strengthen ties with the West, boost the economy of the EU’s poorest member and shield the country from Russian influence. But public opinion has remained split, with many fearing that the transition could push up prices and worsen political uncertainty.President Rumen Radev, speaking shortly before midnight, hailed the move as the “final step” in Bulgaria’s EU integration, even as thousands gathered in sub-zero temperatures in Sofia to mark the New Year. He also expressed regret that Bulgarians had not been consulted through a referendum.“This refusal was one of the dramatic symptoms of the deep divide between the political class and the people, confirmed by mass demonstrations across the country,” Radev said.The euro switch comes at a turbulent political moment. Anti-corruption protests ousted a conservative-led government in mid-December, leaving Bulgaria facing the prospect of its eighth election in five years.“People are afraid that prices will rise, while salaries will remain the same,” a woman in her 40s told AFP in Sofia.At major markets in the capital, prices for goods ranging from groceries to New Year’s Eve items were displayed in both levs and euros. “The whole of Europe has managed with the euro, we’ll manage too,” said Vlad, a retired resident.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Bulgaria’s entry into the eurozone marked “an important milestone”, adding that it would make travel and living abroad easier, improve market transparency and competitiveness, and facilitate trade.Central bank governor Dimitar Radev said the euro represented more than “just a currency — it is a sign of belonging”.However, concerns remain widespread. According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, 49% of Bulgarians oppose the switch. Outgoing prime minister Rossen Jeliazkov sought to reassure citizens and businesses, saying he was “counting on the tolerance and understanding” of the public and insisting that inflation was not linked to euro adoption.Official data show that food prices rose 5% year-on-year in November, more than double the eurozone average. “Unfortunately, prices no longer correspond to those in levs,” pastry shop owner Turgut Ismail, 33, told AFP, saying prices had already begun to rise.Analysts warned that any disruption could be politically sensitive. “Any problems with euro adoption would be seized on by anti-EU politicians,” said Boryana Dimitrova of the Alpha Research polling institute.Some business owners complained of difficulties accessing euros ahead of the switch, while critics questioned the timing. “It’s not the right time,” said Stephane, a 64-year-old economist, citing high debt levels in other eurozone countries.The euro was first introduced in 12 countries in 2002, with Croatia the most recent entrant in 2023. Bulgaria’s accession brings the number of people using the single currency to more than 350 million.","Bulgaria formally gives up the lev, which had been in use since the late 19th century.

US offers temporary sanctions relief to Russian-controlled Serbian oil firm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-offers-temporary-sanctions-relief-to-russian-controlled-serbian-oil-firm/articleshow/126283006.cms,"Serbia Caught In Crossfire As US Opens Energy Front Against Russia; ‘Kick Russians Out’

'Phenomenal news'

The United States has granted a majority-Russian-owned Serbian oil company a temporary reprieve from sanctions targeting Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, a Serbian minister said on Wednesday.Washington's sanctions on the Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), part of its crackdown on Russia's energy sector, forced the shutdown in early December of Serbia's sole oil refinery, which supplies around 80 percent of the Balkan country's fuel needs.The measures have hit hard in Serbia, a key Kremlin ally and one of the few European countries not to have imposed sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine war.""NIS has obtained a licence from US OFAC (the Office of Foreign Assets Control) allowing it to continue operations until January 23. This means that the Pancevo refinery will be able to resume operations after 36 days,"" Serbian Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic said on Instagram.The reprieve will allow the Pancevo refinery, located near the capital Belgrade, to resume its activities refining crude -- a significant relief for Serbia, which has had to dip into its fossil fuel reserves to satisfy domestic demand.""We have achieved what seemed almost impossible. We will safeguard our energy security, as we have done so far,"" Handanovic added.After nine months of successive postponements, Washington on October 9 imposed sanctions on NIS, demanding the complete exit of Russian shareholders and preventing the refinery from receiving supplies.But talks over its potential sale have dragged on, with analysts warning that the refinery's closure could shrink Serbia's economic growth and threaten thousands of jobs.NIS employs some 13,500 people, and contributed more than two billion euros ($2.5 billion) in tax revenue, or nearly 12 percent of the national budget, according to the firm's annual report.Shortly before Handanovic's announcement, President Aleksandar Vucic said on social media that he believed he could soon announce some ""phenomenal political news"".""We've worked hard, we've earned it,"" Vucic added, without offering further details.NIS is 45-percent owned by Gazprom Neft, which has been targeted by US sanctions. Its parent company, Gazprom, transferred its 11.3-percent stake in NIS in September to another Russian firm, Intelligence.The Serbian state holds nearly 30 percent of NIS, with the rest owned by minority shareholders.According to the Serbian national broadcaster RTS, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was involved in discussions between Vucic and the US State Department earlier Wednesday, while the Hungarian firm MOL is in negotiations to buy the Russian portion of NIS's shares.Meanwhile, Croatian pipeline operator Janaf, which had stopped supplying crude to the Pancevo refinery because of the sanctions, also announced it had been informed by OFAC about the reprieve.This decision ""allows us to continue implementing our agreement (with NIS) on oil transportation"" until January 23, the Croatian company stated.The two companies have a contract for crude transport valid until the end of 2026, for a total capacity of 10 million tonnes.","Serbia's sole oil refinery, which supplies 80 percent of the Balkan country's fuel needs, was shut in early December.

The Nasdaq composite was little changed. Trading volumes were muted ahead of the New Year’s Day holiday, when US markets will remain closed.The S&P 500 is up more than 17% so far in 2025, buoyed by enthusiasm around artificial intelligence and its potential to lift corporate profits. Treasury yields edged higher in the bond market.Futures trading earlier in the day had pointed to a cautious open, with S&P 500 and Dow futures down 0.1% and Nasdaq futures lower by 0.2%, as most institutional investors remained on the sidelines.While artificial intelligence stocks powered much of the market’s advance this year, the rally has also attracted scepticism. Investors remain concerned about whether AI investments will deliver sufficient profits and productivity gains to justify current valuations.Stocks linked to the AI boom, including Nvidia and Broadcom, accounted for a large share of the gains in 2025, but worries persist that prices across the broader market have risen faster than underlying earnings.Adding to the caution are concerns that a US-led trade war could stoke inflationary pressures. Although the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate three times toward the end of the year, inflation continues to remain above the central bank’s 2% target.The Fed has cited signs of a weakening labour market as a reason for easing policy, with investors awaiting fresh data on weekly jobless claims later on Wednesday as an indicator of layoffs.Minutes from the Fed’s December meeting underscored divisions among policymakers, and markets are currently betting that the central bank will hold rates steady at its January meeting, AP reported.Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University, said uncertainty continues to build across global markets.“Central banks must tread carefully, and financial markets will likely experience continued volatility as expectations shift,” he said, AP quoted.Commodity markets remained volatile as the year wound down. Silver swung sharply lower, giving back more than 8% early Wednesday after rising over 10% a day earlier, though it remains up more than 140% for the year. Gold fell 1.5% but is still higher by 66% in 2025.US crude oil rose 31 cents to $58.26 a barrel, while Brent crude gained 28 cents to $61.61.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Top stock market recommendations:Despite huge volatility, Nifty has so far gathered half a percent gain for this week after its breakout closing on Friday. With an 8 month high closing seen on Wednesday ahead of its monthly expiry seen today, Nifty is set to scale towards target of its ongoing breakout for levels seen near 25500 odd.

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates have been declining amidst easing Iran-Israel tensions and lower demand for safe haven assets. Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers shares his views and recommendations for gold investors:Weakening bias may persist after a volatile week as prices cools off in line with easing geopolitical tensionsLast week global central banks showed caution with mixed policy moves, the US Fed continued to pause, signalling slower cuts on stagflation concerns, Swiss and Norwegian banks did cut, while BoE and the BoJ held steady.Economic data highlighted strains across regions amid escalating geopolitical risks. Global equities mostly closed lower on Middle East tensions, while US Treasuries rallied, the dollar edged up, and oil advanced.In the current week gold started with a modest upside on escalating middle east geopolitics but gave up gains on Tuesday as the US President Donald Trump announced that both nations had agreed to a complete ceasefire, adding that Iran will begin the truce immediately, followed by Israel.The yellow metal also hit an all-time high last week on MCX after Israel launched military operations targeting Iran's nuclear power plant sites.Investors now turn their attention to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is set to testify before US Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday, for any signals on the future path of interest rates.After setting a record just over $3,500 an ounce in April in spot markets, gold had consolidated in a roller coaster ride, while bearish sentiment has now started to seep into the market despite geopolitical tensions.This is due to the fact that gold prices have now discounted major fundamentals while a wave of corrective moves looks likely in July month.On the fundamental side, prices could look ahead to Fed Chair testimony for further clues on monetary policy outlook amid a data heavy week ahead.MCX Gold looks to test downside support at around Rs. 95,200 - 94,800 per 10 gm levels on Aug. futures contract (CMP Rs. 97,240) in the weeks ahead.In International spot markets (CMP $3320/oz), a close below $ 3270 on daily basis is required for further downside up to $3225-3220 per oz in spot.","Gold rates have been declining amidst easing Iran-Israel tensions and lower demand for safe haven assets.

Asian equities were largely flat on Thursday while oil prices stabilised, as markets took stock of easing geopolitical tensions and awaited fresh cues on US fiscal and trade policy, especially US President Donald Trump’s looming tariff deadline.According to news agency Reuters, investors remained cautious amid uncertainties surrounding Federal Reserve leadership and potential shifts in US interest rate policy.The MSCI’s broad index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan held steady, while Tokyo’s Nikkei climbed 0.9% to touch a four-month high. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.2% and the Shanghai Composite rose 1%, supported by optimism following a ceasefire between Israel and Iran that soothed global supply concerns.Meanwhile, oil markets saw mild gains. Brent crude inched up 0.2% to $67.82 per barrel and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose 0.28% to $65.10, rebounding from sharp losses earlier this week.A day earlier, both benchmarks had climbed nearly 1% following data indicating strong US fuel demand and easing geopolitical risks. Brent had settled at $67.68 and WTI at $64.92 on Wednesday.US government data showed crude inventories dropped by 5.8 million barrels last week, while gasoline demand hit its highest since December 2021.""This type of report can refocus on US supply and demand, and less on geopolitics,"" said Price Futures Group analyst Phil Flynn, as quoted by Reuters.Market confidence was also supported by a fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel, announced by US President Trump, that has helped oil prices return to near pre-conflict levels.Still, ING analysts noted that concerns over Middle East supply haven’t fully dissipated, with ""stronger demand for immediate supply"" continuing to support prices.Adding to market volatility was speculation around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s future, as Trump is reportedly considering replacing him by September or October. This weighed on the US dollar and lifted the euro to $1.6805, its highest since November 2021, while the Swiss franc hit a 10-year high.The dollar index slumped to its lowest since March 2022.“The issue with this is it will resurface questions around the Fed’s independence, which… undermines confidence in the Fed and the USD,” said IG analyst Tony Sycamore, as cited by Reuters.Equity markets globally remain sensitive to signals from central banks, especially with Trump’s July 9 deadline for finalising new trade tariffs approaching. While Powell has reiterated that potential tariffs may cause a “one-time jump in prices”, he warned that the risks of more persistent inflation justify caution.Bank of America strategists, quoted by Reuters, added that “unsustainable fiscal dynamics can trigger an accident in bond markets,” highlighting the need for global fiscal vigilance.Overall, analysts expect oil to consolidate between $65-70 per barrel as traders track US macroeconomic data and the Fed’s next rate move.While the global market mood appears to be stabilising, investors remain watchful for how tariffs, inflation, and central bank responses will shape economic trajectories in the months ahead.",MSCI's broad index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan held steady.

India’s digital economy to cross $1 trillion by 2030: Bessemer Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-digital-economy-to-cross-1-trillion-by-2030-bessemer-report/articleshow/122075316.cms,"AI image

Click, Shop, Repeat

BENGALURU: India’s digital consumer market is set to cross the $1 trillion mark within a decade, fueled by mobile-first behavior and a wave of new consumer brands, according to a new report by Bessemer Venture Partners. The report, titled, finds that rising smartphone usage, affordable mobile data and seamless payments have created a “triple engine” of commerce, content and consumer discernment, making India one of the most dynamic digital economies globally.“Even if this grows at a simplistic rate of 20% every year, it will still cross the trillion-dollar mark,” said Anant Vidur Puri, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, one of the authors of the report. “Time spent on the phone is just going up and up, access to products is far easier, and consumer aspirations have surged. What used to be a trip to the mall and a visit to the movies has now become a mobile-first experience,” he told TOI in an interaction.The report highlighted that mobile internet penetration, with roughly 800 million smartphone users averaging almost eight hours a day online, is reshaping commerce and brand-building.According to the findings, digital platforms have evolved into virtual shelves that enable smaller, niche consumer brands to find national prominence almost instantly.“If you can be a new disruptor, a new trend, a unique thing in the market, the new consumer is looking for you, and platforms will come and get you. A brand can now get listed on 20 platforms almost without doing anything. That has changed in the last ten years and why it’s a great time to build a brand,” Puri said.The report also underscored the growing significance of consumer retention and its impact on long‑term growth. “A brand can scale very rapidly, but eventually you have to live up to the test. Retention is the single most important thing, it changes your time to revenue predictability, reduces your marketing working capital, increases your Ebitda, and reduces your cash burn. You have to solve one thing, and that is retention,” Puri added.Bessemer’s findings point out that India’s digital consumer market comprises many niches, making precision in pricing and positioning vital for new brands. “India is many Indias. What’s affordable for one person is different from what’s affordable for someone else. You have to define very clearly, is your TAM a Rs 100 lipstick, a Rs 500 lipstick, or a Rs 1,999 lipstick? At each price point, someone will consider it ‘cheap’ and someone else ‘expensive’,” Puri said.With an estimated 600 million people in India born after 2001, the consumer trend is being shaped by a generation for whom mobile commerce and digital payments are second nature. “All of them, by the time they went to college, existed in a world where smartphones, blazingfast internet and e‑commerce were just facts. This generation spends more than 50% of their waking time online, that’s where they shop, watch movies, consume content, learn and spend. This is what gives us the conviction that the digital economy will continue to compound for years to come,” Puri said.According to the report, this trend positions India to join the likes of China, where digital commerce accounts for more than 15% of the overall economy, highlighting a long runway for growth. Puri added, “the quick commerce phenomenon, this brand‑building playbook, almost how do you build a brand for a billion Indians, you don’t have to learn from the US. In India, it’s about making brands relevant within the cultural context. These are lessons global markets can learn from India.”","India’s digital consumer market is set to cross the $1 trillion mark within a decade, according to a new report by Bessemer Venture Partners.

Agriculture also showed broad-based growth across major crops in 2024-25, while inflation remained below its target for the fourth consecutive month.While the domestic outlook remains optimistic, the global economic backdrop appears fragile. ""The global economy is in a state of flux, reeling from the twin shocks of trade policy uncertainties and a spike in geopolitical tensions,"" the report said, citing market volatility following the Iran-Israel conflict. Reports from multilateral agencies such as the OECD and World Bank have flagged potential deterioration in medium-term global prospects amid rising protectionism.On the domestic front, the equity markets saw modest gains during May and June but experienced a sharp, short-lived dip before rebounding strongly on June 20, amid heightened tensions in West Asia.The report flagged concerns over near-term inflation pressures and rising term premia due to the worsening US fiscal situation, as well as widening emerging market spreads amid risk-off sentiment.Looking ahead, the central bank said, ""Forward-looking surveys of consumer sentiments show stable consumer confidence for the current period and improved optimism about the future."" It also noted that state govts appear fiscally calibrated, planning to raise capital outlay to 3% of GDP in FY26, underlining a focus on quality expenditure. The IMD's forecast of above-normal southwest monsoon rainfall at 106% of the long-period average is expected to support rural consumption and agricultural output.The report said that India has posted the highest growth among major economies, with a sharp pickup in Q4 FY25 driven by strong fixed investment, high manufacturing capacity utilisation, and buoyant services growth supported by record hiring. However, concerns remain around slowing credit growth, tepid urban demand, rising unemployment, and weaker state finances.","RBI says financial conditions are conducive for transmitting the central bank's 50-basis-point (100bps = 1 percentage point) policy rate cut from June 6 to the credit market.

Gold price prediction today: Gold is in focus with heightened geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel and with the US bombing nuclear facilities in Iran. Will gold prices resume a conclusive upward trend amidst growing global uncertainties?Gold prices remained volatile throughout last week, hovering around the ₹1 lakh mark domestically, as geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran escalated, boosting safe-haven demand.Despite this, gold’s upward momentum was capped by a firm dollar, which was hovering slightly below 100. Investors are closely monitoring the US Federal Reserve’s policy stance after it left interest rates unchanged while signalling a more gradual rate cut path ahead. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized caution, citing stable unemployment and expectations of rising inflation due to tariffs. Markets are pricing in rate cuts totalling 50 bps in 2025, but less aggressive easing for 2026–27.Meanwhile, US data revealed weaker-than-expected retail sales and industrial production, indicating potential economic softness, though jobless claims were lower, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Market participants now await Powell’s upcoming testimony and key economic indicators including preliminary PMIs, GDP, consumer confidence, and the PCE price index.In global developments, China’s central bank held steady on its loan prime rates, adding pressure to industrial metals. Domestically, silver saw some profit booking from all-time highs. Despite tensions and US intervention in the Iran-Israel conflict, Iran' s stance on Strait of Hormus is very important for further direction in the market.","Gold prices remained volatile throughout last week, hovering around the ₹1 lakh mark domestically.

ITR Filing Deadline Extended: Why It Happened And What To Do Now? | Income Tax Return | Explained

ITR e-filing FY 2024-25: Which Form For Gig Workers?

Importantly, ITR-1 and ITR-2 do not apply to income from freelancing or gig work. Selecting the correct form is crucial for smooth return processing and to avoid errors or compliance notices.

Freelancers maintaining books of accounts and claiming actual business expenses should file ITR-3 .

. Alternatively, those in specified professions—such as legal, accounting, or technical consultancy etc—with gross receipts up to Rs 50 lakh (or Rs 75 lakh if cash receipts do not exceed 5% of the total gross receipts) may opt for ITR-4 under the presumptive taxation scheme. Under the presumptive taxation scheme, 50% of gross receipts are deemed taxable, simplifying compliance by eliminating the need for detailed bookkeeping.

Income Tax Return (ITR) e-filing FY 2024-25: ITR filing may be relatively straightforward for salaried individuals, but what about gig workers and those who earn through freelancing? With the rise of freelance and gig-based income, many individuals are unsure how to report such earnings correctly.The ITR filing for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) has been partially thrown open on the Income Tax Portal incometax.gov.in. Individuals who have to file their tax returns using ITR-1 or ITR-4 forms can now do so. So which ITR form should gig workers and free lancers use to file their ITR for FY 2024-25?As non-traditional work arrangements grow, understanding the appropriate tax filing requirements is essential for freelancers and gig workers to remain compliant and minimize potential issues.According to Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner, EY India, income from independent work—such as writing, design, consulting, tuition, or platform-based gigs like ride-sharing and food delivery—is treated as “Profits and Gains from Business or Profession” under Indian tax law.Amarpal Chadha tells TOI that ITR-4 cannot be filed if the taxpayer has incomes like short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains u/s 112A exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh, income from and reporting of foreign assets, etc.""If an individual who is a freelancer or gig worker has capital gains referred above, they will have to file ITR - 3. Ideally, ITR -3 isto be used for business income. However, ITR-4 is an option if your income in under certain limits to make the return process simpler. If those conditions are not met, they will have to stick to ITR-3,"" he says.Also Read | Income Tax Return: Are capital gains from MFs taxed differently under new & old regime?

US-Iran tensions spike: Washington issues 'worldwide caution'; Tehran says response to American strikes will be 'proportionate',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-iran-tensions-spike-washington-issues-worldwide-caution-tehran-says-response-to-american-strikes-will-be-proportionate/articleshow/122013293.cms,"Global alert: Exercise increased caution



Türkiye: Avoid Southeast, maintain low profile

Lebanon: Non-essential staff ordered to depart

Saudi Arabia: Avoid military sites





The United States has issued a sweeping global security alert for its citizens following its military strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The State Department warned of potential reprisals against Americans, and ordered the departure of non-essential diplomatic staff from Lebanon, while also issuing specific advisories for Türkiye and Saudi Arabia.The US missile strikes which President Donald Trump claimed had “completely and fully obliterated” Iran’s nuclear facilities have provoked fierce threats from Tehran, which has vowed a “proportionate response” at a time and place of its choosing. With Israeli air raids continuing deep into Iranian territory and Tehran’s Revolutionary Guard launching retaliatory missile attacks, fears of a prolonged confrontation have grown.Iran has signalled that US military bases and regional allies could be targeted if used in attacks against it. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s advisor Ali Akbar Velayati warned that “any country used by the US to strike Iran will be a legitimate target for our armed forces.”“The Department of State advises US citizens worldwide to exercise increased caution,” the alert read. In light of “disruptions to travel and periodic closure of airspace across the Middle East,” and the potential for demonstrations against US citizens, travellers were urged to consult the most recent travel advisories and country-specific information.The warning directs citizens to visit the Department’s website for up-to-date guidance and security alerts.The US Embassy in Türkiye has cautioned its personnel to avoid the consular district of Adana in the country’s southeast, encompassing 22 provinces. “Negative sentiment toward US foreign policy may prompt actions against US or Western interests,” the alert said, citing risks of demonstrations, graffiti, boycotts and anti-American rhetoric.Americans in Türkiye were advised to avoid protest areas, monitor local media, and “exercise caution and stay alert at locations publicly associated with the United States or Israel or frequented by Westerners.”In Beirut, the State Department on ordered the departure of non-emergency government staff and family members due to a “volatile and unpredictable security situation.” While flights remain operational at Rafic Hariri International Airport, the embassy noted that “some airlines have suspended or cancelled flights,” urging citizens to monitor news updates and leave while commercial options are still available.“We remind US citizens to continue to exercise caution,” the embassy said, stressing the uncertain and rapidly evolving nature of the conflict.The US Mission to Saudi Arabia issued a separate advisory warning American citizens and its own staff to “limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region.” The alert acknowledged the fluid situation following Israel’s military campaign and the US strikes, urging Americans to prepare personal emergency plans and review existing travel arrangements.“Crises can happen unexpectedly while travelling or living abroad, and a good plan helps you think through potential scenarios,” it added, with assurances that embassy staffing and consular services remain unaffected for now.The alerts come as Washington’s intervention in Israel’s war with Iran escalates regional instability. Israeli forces continued their aerial bombardment of Iranian targets on Sunday, hitting missile sites and infrastructure in Tehran, Hamedan and Kermanshah. Iran’s response has included launching long-range missiles at Israel and threatening further escalation.Iran’s UN ambassador accused the US of “destroying diplomacy,” while other officials insisted that Iran’s nuclear programme though damaged was not completely halted. “Even if nuclear sites are destroyed, game isn’t over,” wrote Ali Shamkhani, another advisor to Khamenei.","U.S. State Department issues global security alert for its citizens.

The 2.6% surge in early trading reflected growing investor confidence in the chipmaker’s leadership in the booming artificial intelligence (AI) sector.The rally was partly driven by market anticipation ahead of Micron Technology’s quarterly earnings, due after market hours. Micron manufactures high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, a key component in Nvidia’s advanced AI accelerators.Strong results from Micron are expected to signal continued demand across the AI hardware supply chain, further reinforcing Nvidia’s bullish outlook.Beyond hardware, Nvidia’s growth is being propelled by its expanding software and cloud services business. Its DGX Cloud platform — which allows organisations to run large-scale AI workloads on Nvidia’s infrastructure — has seen adoption across industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. This marks a strategic shift, positioning Nvidia as not just a chipmaker but a full-stack AI solutions provider.Investor optimism has remained strong since Nvidia’s impressive first-quarter earnings in late May, which beat analyst estimates and highlighted robust revenue growth.The company’s performance remains resilient despite geopolitical headwinds, including US export restrictions on chip sales to China, once a major market.The focus now turns to Micron’s earnings, expected to provide broader insight into the strength and sustainability of the AI hardware boom.Earlier this month, Nvidia briefly became the world’s most valuable publicly listed company, overtaking Microsoft. It has been trading market-cap leadership with Microsoft and Apple since mid-2023. The latest surge reestablishes Nvidia’s dominance, underscoring its rapid ascent as a key force in the AI revolution.As global demand for AI infrastructure continues to rise, Nvidia’s position at the heart of the technology ecosystem appears increasingly unshakable.","Nvidia shares soared to an all-time high of $152.97 on Wednesday, surpassing its previous record close of $149.43 set in January.

Rate cut war: Donald Trump narrows choice for next US Fed chair to ‘three or four people’; calls Jerome Powell ‘terrible’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rate-cut-war-donald-trump-narrows-choice-for-next-us-fed-chair-to-three-or-four-people-calls-jerome-powell-terrible/articleshow/122075429.cms,"'BACK OFF': Trump Scolds, But Fails To 'Control' Fed Reserve Chair; Powell Roars In Rare Statement

US President Donald Trump called Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell “terrible” and said he had narrowed down his choice for the next Fed chair to “three or four people,” stoking fresh speculation about an early leadership change at the central bank.“I know within three or four people who I’m going to pick,” Trump told reporters, when asked if he was interviewing candidates to succeed Powell, whose term ends in May 2026.According to a Reuters report, the list of leading contenders includes former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governor Christopher Waller, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett.Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell for not moving fast enough to cut interest rates, even threatening to fire him — a move many legal experts say would breach the Fed’s independent mandate.While Trump told reporters earlier this month, “I’m not going to fire him,” analysts view his repeated barbs as an attempt to exert political pressure and potentially install a “shadow” chair before the end of Powell’s term.In testimony to Congress on Tuesday, Powell warned that new US tariffs could push up inflation this summer, even as the Fed considers when to start cutting rates. “We’re not rushing,” Powell said, noting the central bank expects inflation to tick up in the near term.“For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,” Powell said in prepared testimony to the House Financial Services Committee, according to the Associated Press.The Fed chair's comments come as he began two days of potentially heated testimony on Capitol Hill, with members of Congress set to grill him on inflation, employment and the outlook for monetary policy. Powell acknowledged that inflation could tick higher this summer, but said the central bank is not in a rush to lower borrowing costs.His remarks drew a sharp rebuke from Trump, who lashed out at Powell in a social media post just hours before the hearing.“Too Late' Jerome Powell, of the Fed, will be in Congress today in order to explain, among other things, why he is refusing to lower the Rate,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO. No inflation, great economy — We should be at least two to three points lower. Would save the USA 800 Billion Dollars Per Year, plus. What a difference this would make.”Trump continued “If things later change to the negative, increase the Rate. I hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over. We will be paying for his incompetence for many years to come. THE BOARD SHOULD ACTIVATE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”","US President Donald Trump called Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell “terrible” and said he had narrowed down his choice for the next Fed chair to “three or four people,” stoking fresh speculation about an early leadership change.

China Sides With Iran, Greenlights Hormuz BLOCKADE? Beijing's First Response As U.S. Seeks Help

US Sanctions On Iran

China To Buy More US Oil?

US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that China may proceed with Iranian oil purchases following the Israel-Iran ceasefire agreement, though the White House subsequently clarified this statement does not represent an easing of US sanctions.""China can now continue to purchase oil from Iran. Hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the US, also,"" Trump posted on Truth Social, shortly after authorising US strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.A senior White House official explained to Reuters that Trump's statement highlighted Iran's decision not to block the Strait of Hormuz to oil vessels, as such a blockade would have significantly affected China, which is the largest buyer of Iranian oil.The official said, ""The president continues to call on China and all countries to import our state-of-the-art oil rather than import Iranian oil in violation of US sanctions.""Oil prices dropped approximately 6% on Tuesday, influenced by Trump's remarks regarding China following the ceasefire declaration.A potential easing of sanctions on Iran would indicate a departure from the previous stance, as Trump had announced in February his intention to maintain maximum pressure on Iran, targeting its oil exports due to concerns over its nuclear programme and regional militant support.Trump had previously implemented multiple sanctions affecting Chinese independent refineries and port operators due to their Iranian oil purchases.""President Trump's greenlight for China to keep buying Iranian oil reflects a return to lax enforcement standards,"" said Scott Modell, a former CIA officer, now CEO of Rapidan Energy Group, according to the Reuters report.Beyond non-enforcement, the president holds authority to suspend or waive sanctions through executive orders or congressional legislation.According to Modell, Trump is unlikely to waive sanctions before upcoming US-Iran nuclear negotiations, as these measures provide strategic advantage considering Tehran's requirement for permanent sanctions relief.Jeremy Paner from Hughes Hubbard & Reed law firm indicated that a presidential decision to suspend Iran-related oil sanctions would necessitate substantial inter-agency coordination.The United States Treasury would require authorisation permits, whilst the State Department must provide waivers that necessitate notification to Congress.Market specialists and oil analysts across Asia indicated that Trump's statements were unlikely to influence China's immediate procurement patterns for oil, whether from Iran or the United States.Iranian crude constitutes approximately 13.6% of China's petroleum acquisitions this year, with the reduced-price supplies serving as crucial support for independent refineries operating under tight margins. American oil represents merely 2% of Chinese imports, and Beijing's imposed 10% duties on US petroleum effectively discourage additional purchases.China consistently challenges what it terms Washington's ""abuse of illegal unilateral sanctions.""When questioned about Trump's statement during a standard press conference, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun stated that China would implement appropriate energy security measures aligned with its national interests.Increased Iranian oil acquisitions by China and other nations could potentially create tension with Saudi Arabia, the global leader in oil exports.The effectiveness of US sanctions on Iranian exports has remained restricted since the initial stringent measures implemented during Trump's previous administration.This year, Trump has imposed sanctions on Chinese trading firms and terminals, yet the outcomes have been notably less impactful than intended, according to Modell's assessment.In response to media queries, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce confirmed that Trump had indicated his objectives and the administration is committed to achieving them. She declined to elaborate on specific procedures.""But clearly we are focused on making sure that (the) guiding hand of President Trump prevails and moves this government forward, so we will have to wait and see when it comes to what that ends up looking like,"" Bruce said.","US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that China may proceed with Iranian oil purchases following the Israel-Iran ceasefire agreement.

Petrol, Diesel Prices May Go Up As Iran Aims To Block Supply Through Hormuz Strait, Global Prices Up

Oil markets swiftly reversed initial panic after Israel’s June 13 strike on Iran, with Brent crude falling back below $70 per barrel as traders sensed the conflict would not escalate further.Despite a brief $10 spike, the muted response from Tehran, including a symbolic missile attack that caused no damage, signalled de-escalation, calming fears of supply disruptions and showing how the global oil system proved more resilient than expected, as per ET.Before the Israeli strikes, Brent was already trading at around $69. Though US involvement over the weekend rattled markets, Iran’s symbolic missile attack on a US base in Qatar, which caused no damage, calmed fears.Traders viewed the move as largely domestic posturing, suggesting Iran wanted to signal resolve without provoking a wider conflict.“This rivals some of the historic selloffs,” said Tom Kloza, chief market strategist at Turner Mason & Co, after Brent tumbled on Monday. He added, “When the response comes and it is muted, oil drops,” as quoted by the news agency AP.The ceasefire announced Tuesday further eased concerns of supply disruption.The threat of Iran shutting the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of global oil supply passes, loomed large, but analysts and US officials saw that scenario as unlikely. US Vice President JD Vance called the idea “suicidal,” reported AP.Tehran itself exports 1.5 million barrels a day through the strait, and closing it would have harmed its already fragile economy.According to ET, traders pointed to a recurring pattern in Iran’s military actions, strikes designed to appease domestic audiences rather than inflict serious damage.The broader context has also shifted as today's oil market is better insulated from shocks, with the US now producing about 13 million barrels a day, outpacing both Saudi Arabia and Russia.Meanwhile, OPEC+ production hikes since May have helped keep markets well-supplied. “The price of oil today, closer to $68 per barrel compared to $84 a year ago, reflects this cushion”. Strategic reserves, particularly in the US, offer additional buffers.Iran’s cautious behaviour stems from multiple pressures. Israeli strikes have weakened its military capability, and years of US sanctions have left its economy reliant on discounted oil sales to China. A prolonged war would jeopardise what little economic leverage remains.Regional dynamics have also shifted. With Hamas and Hezbollah weakened and Russia distracted in Ukraine, Iran’s traditional support base has eroded. Even China, though critical of Western aggression, has been reluctant to deepen its commitment to Tehran.Oil markets remain alert, but many believe Tehran is unlikely to provoke a larger crisis. “History suggests Iran won't disrupt its own oil flow,” said Houston-based analyst Andy Lipow. However, he added, “countries, like people, don't always act in their economic interests,” reported AP.For now, the market is betting that cooler heads will prevail, at least until the next flare-up.","Oil markets reversed initial panic after Israel’s June 13 strike on Iran.

Taiwanese electronics giant Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, globally known as Foxconn, has secured approval from Taiwan’s ministry of economic affairs to invest over $2.2 billion in India and the United States.A major portion, $1.49 billion, will be routed through Foxconn’s Singapore-based subsidiary into Yuzhan Technology (India) Private Ltd, another Foxconn entity.The capital will be used to establish a new manufacturing facility in India aimed at producing iPhones and their components, reported news agency ANI, citing Focus Taiwan.Experts view this as a strategic move by Foxconn to shift part of its supply chain out of China amid rising trade tensions with the US, as per ANI. India is steadily emerging as a critical manufacturing hub for Apple, which has plans to source the majority of iPhones sold in the US from India in the June quarter, while China will cater to other markets.Foxconn’s expansion doesn’t stop at India. It has also been cleared to invest $735 million to establish a US-based company named Project ETA (DE) LLC. The new unit will focus on producing data centre equipment and assembling servers.Currently, Foxconn operates 223 factories and offices across 24 countries, including 12 in India and 54 in the Americas. The company has also increased its global presence in regions such as Mexico, Vietnam, and Europe.Besides Foxconn, other Taiwanese firms have also received investment clearance. Cathay United Bank will invest $160 million in its Ho Chi Minh City branch to support its lending business. AUO Mobility Solution Corp got the go-ahead to pump $20 million into its Xiamen unit in China for vehicle display components.Additionally, Hong Kong’s Royal Seal Holding Co will invest about $3.29 million in its Taiwan branch focused on cancer treatment. Taiwanese company Cowealth Medical Holding Co remains a key stakeholder in Royal Seal.The recent surge in Foxconn’s India investments aligns with Apple's plan to produce around 60 million iPhones in the country this fiscal year. Indian government officials say India currently accounts for 15% of the global iPhone output.","Taiwanese electronics giant Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, globally known as Foxconn, has secured approval from Taiwan’s ministry of economic affairs to invest over $2.2 billion in India and the United States.

Asian stocks held firm on Wednesday while oil prices lingered near multi-week lows, as a tentative ceasefire between Israel and Iran continued to support investor sentiment, reported news agency Reuters.Though risks of renewed hostilities remain, the fragile truce has helped soothe market nerves after weeks of geopolitical turbulence.Japan’s Nikkei and Australia’s ASX 200 were little changed, while Taiwan’s Taiex gained 1 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.6 per cent and Chinese blue-chip stocks dipped 0.1 per cent.Broader market sentiment was steady, with the MSCI world stock index hovering near record highs.The positive momentum was underpinned by easing oil prices.Brent crude fell nearly 7 per cent to $67.14 per barrel, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate dropped 6 per cent to $64.37, extending Tuesday’s losses, reported news agency AFP.This marks two consecutive days of steep declines as markets reacted to signs that oil supply routes in the Middle East remain unaffected. Analysts said the fall was also driven by US President Donald Trump’s claim that China may resume buying Iranian oil, further easing fears of a supply crunch.""The de-escalation seems to be doing better,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth, as quoted by AFP. Crude prices, now below pre-conflict levels, are seen as reducing inflationary risks and could open space for central banks to consider interest rate cuts.The drop in oil prices also pushed US Treasury yields lower. The 10-year yield fell to 4.29 per cent, and the two-year yield slipped to 3.81 per cent, signalling rising expectations of a policy pivot, reported AP.On Wall Street, stocks continued their rebound on Tuesday. The S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent, the Dow gained 1.2 per cent, and the Nasdaq jumped 1.4 per cent, placing all three indices within reach of their all-time highs.European markets also rallied, with Paris and Frankfurt posting solid gains, though London closed flat due to losses in oil majors.In currency markets, the dollar weakened, falling 0.1 per cent to 144.70 yen, while the euro rose to $1.1625, its highest level since October 2021. The euro/pound exchange dropped to 85.24 pence from 85.60 pence.With energy costs easing and geopolitical risks contained for now, markets appear to be pricing in a smoother path ahead, though investors remain cautious of any flare-up that could reverse the recent optimism.","Japan's Nikkei and Australia's ASX 200 were little changed on Wednesday.

Qantas Airways flight, airborne for 15 hours, returns to origin airport",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/a-flight-to-nowhere-qantas-airways-flight-airborne-for-15-hours-returns-to-origin-airport-courtesy-middle-east-airspace-closure/articleshow/122052325.cms,"The US military intervention in Israel's conflict with Iran has led to widespread travel chaos globally this week. (AI image)

Imagine a 15 hour flight that leads you - nowhere! That’s the plight of passengers on a recent Qantas Airways flight, which flew for 15 hours, only to return to its place of origin. Travellers on a Qantas Airways Ltd. flight to Paris experienced an unusual situation when their aircraft returned to Australia after spending over 15 hours airborne.The diversion occurred due to Iranian missile strikes that resulted in extensive airspace closures across the Middle East region.According to a Bloomberg report, the Boeing Co. 787 aircraft commenced its scheduled 17-hour journey from Perth at 7.35 p.m. local time on Monday. However, on reaching the south-western borders of Indian airspace, the airline received notification about the missile attack. This development necessitated the aircraft's return to Perth, where it touched down safely at approximately 11 a.m. on Tuesday.The Perth-London Heathrow service operated by Qantas was similarly impacted, necessitating a diversion to Singapore, according to the airline's official statement.Qantas Airways arranged overnight accommodation for travellers on both services. These route changes have implications for subsequent flights returning from London and Paris, with Qantas actively exploring solutions for impacted customers.The carrier confirmed its commitment to continuously assess available airspace and implement various flight routes for European services, taking into consideration both weather conditions and security circumstances.Qantas's direct services to Europe departing from Perth regularly traverse the Middle East airspace, and occasionally have needed to take extended diversions to avoid restricted zones or make refuelling stops in Singapore.The US military intervention in Israel's conflict with Iran has led to widespread travel chaos globally this week, with flights still being cancelled on Tuesday, despite President Donald Trump's announcement of an active ceasefire.After Trump authorised unprecedented strikes on three Iranian military and nuclear facilities during the weekend, Iran retaliated on Monday with a restricted missile offensive targeting American forces stationed at Qatar's Al Udeid Air Base. Qatar swiftly denounced the assault, having shut its airspace merely hours before the incident.According to an AP report, regional airports and aviation routes have remained tense since June 13, when Israel initiated the lethal conflict through unexpected attacks on Iran, which subsequently countered with missile and drone operations.In the aftermath of the US military action, an increasing number of airlines suspended their services, particularly in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, situated directly across the Persian Gulf from Iran.Following the ceasefire declaration between Israel and Iran, certain disruptions showed signs of improvement. However, the stability of the agreement came into question on Tuesday when Trump pointed out violations by both nations. Several airlines opted to suspend specific routes until mid-week due to safety considerations.The aviation sector in the Middle East experienced significant impact, with numerous carriers facing substantial cancellations and delays throughout the week.","Passengers on a Qantas Airways flight to Paris experienced an unusual situation when their aircraft returned to Australia after spending over 15 hours airborne.

Indian EB-5 investors take USCIS to court over ‘unlawful’ denial of application,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/indian-eb-5-investors-take-uscis-to-court-over-unlawful-denial-of-application/articleshow/122051832.cms,"Representative image

A group of Indian nationals who collectively invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into the US economy under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program (commonly referred to as the investment-linked green card) have sued the head of the US government office overseeing the program, alleging unlawful denial of their applications and failure to implement investor protections mandated by law.The lawsuit, filed in a US District Court (Northern District of California) lists seven plaintiffs—Indian citizens living in California, New York, and India—who invested in a pooled fund managed by the now defunct Texas EB-5 Regional Center. The suit names Alissa Emmel, Chief of the Immigrant Investor Program Office at US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), as the sole defendant.At the heart of the dispute is the plaintiffs’ contention that USCIS failed to honour provisions of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 (RIA). The Act was passed by the US Congress to shield ‘good faith’ EB-5 investors from fallout when regional centers or project sponsors failed to comply with program requirements or became defunct. This lawsuit is perhaps the first of its kind following the passage of the RIA.Under the EB-5 route currently an investment of $800,000 for projects in Target Employment Areas (TEAs) - which are rural and high-unemployment areas or for infrastructure projects; or an investment of $1,050,000 in other cases, entitles the investor to a green-card comparatively quickly.For Indians, caught in a decades long backlog for an employment-linked green card, this route is a quicker option – if they have the money to make the investment required under the EB-5 program.In addition, to the investment, job creation of at least ten local jobs is required. Investments can be made either directly (such as by operating a business) or indirectly via regional centers, which in turn invest in commercial enterprises which initiate specific projects – such as building a hotel. A significant number of investors opt for the regional center route.According to the lawsuit-complaint, the Texas-based regional center failed to pay statutorily required fees and did not file the required annual compliance forms. Under the RIA, such noncompliance should have triggered an automatic termination of the center within 90 days. However, USCIS allegedly took no action until more than a year later—following a separate lawsuit filed by another investor.Because USCIS delayed the termination of the regional center and failed to notify investors as required, the plaintiffs argue they were wrongly denied the opportunity to amend their EB-5 petitions or re-associate with compliant projects—a key protection offered under the RIA. Instead, each of their applications (Form I-526 petitions)—filed between 2019 and 2020—were summarily denied in 2024. The lawsuit states that USCIS violated the Administrative Procedure Act by unlawfully withholding agency action and failing to follow statutory procedures.Beyond the legal claims, the lawsuit-complaint documents personal hardships that the plaintiffs had to bear: missed career opportunities, financial hardship, and emotional distress stemming from prolonged uncertainty. Some have lived in the US for years on temporary visas and were hoping for permanent residency through the EB-5 route. Others, who are in India are unable to plan their futures.One plaintiff, based in California holding an H-1B visa, described the strain of being laid-off and the difficulty in finding suitable employment opportunities without a green card. Owing to his temporary non-immigrant visa status, he also pointed out that it was difficult to travel to India to attend marriages or even funerals. Another plaintiff, based in Santa Clara, said he passed up several career advancement opportunities due to the instability of his immigration status and also put his dream of home-ownership on hold.For plaintiffs still residing in India, the story was similar. Two of the petitioners from Gujarat said they had turned down business opportunities and now faced uncertainty about both professional prospects and personal plans.In their lawsuit-complaint, these plaintiffs submitted that USCIS’s inaction undermines Congressional intent behind the 2022 reform, which was specifically designed to prevent immigrant investors from losing their immigration prospects due to failures beyond their control. Despite public USCIS statements that pre-RIA investors are eligible for protections, the plaintiffs say the agency has failed to apply those principles in practice.Alexandra George Santhanam, Associate Attorney at The Galati Law Firm, which is representing these investors, stated, “Plaintiffs each invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the U.S. economy. They did everything in their power to apply for permanent residency in good faith. USCIS ignored the duties imposed upon it by Congress. Because of that, their American Dream is now dead. This is an injustice that the Court has the power to address and order the Defendant to remedy. ”Plaintiffs are asking the court to declare USCIS’ inaction unlawful, reopen their EB-5 petitions, and provide the written notices necessary to reinvest their capital and continue their immigration processes.The lawsuit may test how seriously US immigration authorities are held to their own statutory obligations—and whether the ‘American Dream’ that the EB-5 investors were sold can be salvaged by court intervention.",Group of Indian nationals who collectively invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into the US economy under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program have sued the head of the US government office overseeing the program. They allege unlawful denial of their applications and failure to implement investor protections mandated by law. This lawsuit is perhaps the first of its kind following the passage of the RIA.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122051839,imgsize-593870,width-400,resizemode-4/122051839.jpg"
"US markets today: Wall Street nears record high as oil slides on Israel-Iran ceasefire; crypto, travel stocks rally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-today-wall-street-nasdaq-dow-jones-sp-500-crude-oil-prices-israel-iran-ceasefire/articleshow/122050726.cms,"(With inputs from AP)

Wall Street surged on Tuesday with the S&P 500 coming within 1% of its all-time high, as global markets cheered the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. The optimism sent oil prices tumbling and lifted equities across sectors, with travel, crypto and tech stocks among the top gainers.At 12:47 pm ET, the S&P 500 was up 1.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 517 points or 1.2%, and the Nasdaq rose 1.5%. The gains mirrored a broader rally across global markets, where stocks in Europe and Asia posted gains of over 1% following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “complete and total ceasefire” between the two warring nations.The biggest market reaction came from crude oil, with US benchmark prices dropping 6.1% to $64.33 per barrel, and Brent crude slipping 6.1% to $66.21. Oil is now trading below pre-conflict levels as fears of supply disruption faded. Analysts said Iran’s retaliatory strike on Monday avoided targeting key oil infrastructure, and Trump confirmed the truce was holding, easing concerns over a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz — a critical chokepoint for global oil.“Oil prices are falling rapidly, and with the global market well supplied and OPEC+ continuing to ramp up output, we may see further declines if the ceasefire endures,” Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank, said, as quoted AP.Falling oil prices are expected to ease inflationary pressures, potentially giving the US Federal Reserve room to consider rate cuts. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, testifying before Congress on Tuesday, reiterated a cautious stance, stating the central bank is “well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.”While Powell said rate cuts could come “sooner rather than later,” he added, “I wouldn’t want to point to a particular meeting. I don’t think we need to be in any rush because the economy is still strong.”Trump, who has repeatedly called for aggressive rate cuts, renewed his pressure earlier in the day, criticising Powell and urging the Fed Board to act to support growth.Bond yields reflected the uncertainty. The 10-year US Treasury yield dipped to 4.29% from 4.34% a day earlier, while the two-year yield fell to 3.81% from 3.84%.On Wall Street, Carnival Corp jumped 6.8% after reporting a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and raising its full-year forecast. CEO Josh Weinstein said demand for near-term cruise bookings remained robust.Uber Technologies rose 8.2% after announcing that users in Atlanta can now hail rides in Waymo autonomous vehicles through its app, while Coinbase rallied 10.7% as bitcoin crossed the $105,000 mark.Global stock indices also surged following the ceasefire. France’s CAC 40, Germany’s DAX, and Japan’s Nikkei gained over 1%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 2.1% and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 3%.","The S&P 500 was up 1.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 517 points or 1.2%, and the Nasdaq rose 1.5%.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

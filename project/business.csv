Introducing sector-specific licences, allowing insurers to operate in specialised segments such as cyber, property, or marine insurance, with the government empowered to notify additional classes of business in consultation with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA).

Allowing mergers between insurance and non-insurance companies.

Moving away from detailed statutory provisions to a regulation-led framework, granting IRDA the authority to prescribe operational norms—including capital requirements, solvency margins, and investment conditions—through regulations rather than Parliamentary legislation.

Empowering IRDA to set limits on commissions and remuneration for insurance agents.

Creating a Policyholders’ Education and Protection Fund, to be financed through penalties levied on insurers.

Expanding the definition of insurance intermediaries to include entities such as insurance repositories.

Easing licensing norms for surveyors and loss assessors, with regulatory oversight replacing statutory control.

NEW DELHI: The Parliament on Wednesday cleared the new insurance bill that allows 100% FDI. The ""Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha Bill"" was passed in Rajya Sabha, a day after getting Lok Sabha's nod.This comes despite several Rajya Sabha opposition members' demands that it's referred to a Parliamentary committee fir further scrutiny. The members also objected to the Bill’s title, noting that it uses both English and Hindi.The debate on the bill began after being moved by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for consideration.

US Social Security alarm: Trump administration may force 39 states for repayment to foster kids — Check reasons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-social-security-alarm-trump-administration-may-force-39-states-for-repayment-to-foster-kids-check-reasons/articleshow/126041192.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The US administration for children and families (ACF) under the department of health and human services wrote to the governors of 39 states, calling on them to safeguard Social Security benefits meant for children in foster care.In letters sent on Thursday, the ACF flagged concerns alleging that state child welfare agencies are collecting Social Security survivor and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits owed to foster children and using the funds to offset foster care costs, rather than preserving them for the children.“Every earned benefit dollar belongs to these foster youth, not government agencies or bureaucrats,” ACF Assistant Secretary Alex J. Adams said, stressing that protecting children must remain central to child welfare policy, as reported by Economic Times quoting Daily Express US.Idaho has discontinued the practice under Adams’ leadership, joining ten other states that have enacted policies protecting foster children’s benefits. The federal authorities are now working on ways to reform practices in the states where benefit collection continues.According to a Social Security Advisory Report, published in September, cited by Daily Express US, around 27,000 foster children, i.e. more than 5 per cent of the total foster care population receive Social Security or SSI benefits. Several states routinely divert these funds, saving millions in foster care expenditure, according to the Associated Press.Social Security survivor benefits are based on lifetime contributions made by deceased parents and are considered a critical financial resource for affected children. The agency is now seeking to ensure that benefits are preserved for foster children, particularly as they transition out of state care.The issue has drawn political attention in recent years. In March 2024, Senator Elizabeth Warren raised the matter during a Senate hearing, calling for a ban on states collecting foster children’s survivor benefits. She claimed states had taken at least $179 million from foster children in 2018 alone to fund unrelated state expenses.Warren alleged that some states screen children in foster care for Social Security eligibility—sometimes using data-mining firms—and divert the proceeds into state budgets. “Those benefits are being used for everything from office supplies to prisons,” she said.","The US administration for children and families (ACF) under the department of health and human services wrote to the governors of 39 states, calling on them to safeguard Social Security benefits meant for children in foster care.

MCX Gold continues to trade in a strong positive trend, clearly exhibiting a pattern of higher highs and higher lows, which reinforces the underlying bullish momentum. This price structure indicates sustained buying interest at lower levels and suggests that the broader trend remains firmly upward. As long as this pattern holds, the outlook for MCX Gold remains constructive.From a technical perspective, the immediate support is placed around the 132,000 level. This zone has acted as a reliable base in recent price action, where buying has consistently emerged on minor declines. Any pullback toward this level is likely to attract fresh buying interest, thereby limiting downside risk in the near term. Holding above this support keeps the bullish structure intact.On the upside, MCX Gold has the potential to move toward the 137,000 level in the coming sessions.This target aligns with the continuation of the prevailing trend and reflects the strength of the current momentum. A sustained move above intermediate resistance levels could further accelerate the upside.Overall, unless there is a decisive break below the 132,000 support, MCX Gold is expected to maintain its positive bias. The broader technical setup favors continuation of the uptrend, with higher levels remaining achievable as momentum and sentiment stay supportive.MCX Silver has given a clear breakout from a consolidation pattern, which is a strong positive technical signal and indicates the continuation of an upward move.Consolidation phases typically represent a period of balance between buyers and sellers, and a breakout from such a structure often leads to a sharp expansion in price as momentum builds. The recent price action in MCX Silver suggests that buyers have gained control, supporting a bullish outlook.From a technical standpoint, the breakout confirms renewed strength in the trend and improves the probability of further upside. As long as prices sustain above the breakout zone, the bullish bias is likely to remain intact. The immediate and crucial support is seen around the 199,000 level. This level now acts as a strong base, and any corrective move toward this zone could attract fresh buying interest, helping to stabilize prices.On the upside, MCX Silver has the potential to move toward the 210,000 level in the near to medium term. This target is derived from the height of the consolidation range and aligns well with the current momentum. Overall, unless prices fall back below the 199,000 support, MCX Silver is expected to maintain its positive trajectory, with higher levels remaining achievable as bullish sentiment continues to strengthen.","Gold prices are reaching new highs and continue to trade with a bullish bias.

Benchmark indices continue to trade in a range with corrective bias and are currently placed around 25,800 levels as domestic markets tracked the global risk-off tone, pressured by persistent FII selling, a softer rupee, and ongoing uncertainty around US–India trade talks.In the near term, market movements are expected to be driven by a combination of key global and domestic factors. These include the (a) Outcome of Japan’s monetary policy decisions, which could influence global liquidity and currency flows. (b) Upcoming US economic data releases that may shape expectations around growth, inflation, and interest rates. (c) A greater clarity on trade-related developments between the US and India, which could have implications for bilateral trade flows, sector-specific performance, and overall investor sentiment. Together, these factors are likely to play a crucial role in determining short-term market direction.Nifty has key support placed at 25,700–25,800, which aligns with the 50-day EMA, last week low and a key retracement zone of the prior uptrend. Sustaining this band will be crucial for continuing the positive momentum of the last 3 months.We expect the Nifty to consolidate in the range of 25,700–26,300. A clear breakout or breakdown will determine the next directional move.A close below the key support area of 25,700 will signal extension of the corrective decline towards the 100 days EMA placed around 25400 levels. On the higher side immediate resistance is placed at 26,000. A move above the same will open upside towards the all-time high of 26,200-26,300 in the coming weeks.Bank Nifty traded in a range, digesting its recent strong gains. The index consolidated in a 1500 points range in the last 4 weeks, oscillating in a positive and negative territory.We expect the index to extend consolidation and form a base in the range of 58500-60100 in the coming weeks.A strength above current week’s high of 59,500 will open further upside towards 60,400 levels in the coming weeks.The entire up move of the last 2 months is well channeled signaling sustained demand at elevated levels. Key support is placed at 58,300-58,600 levels, being the confluence of the 50 day EMA and recent breakout area. Holding above the support area will keep the short-term bias positive.Max Healthcare offers an opportunity driven by a visible and ROCE-accretive expansion cycle, sustained improvements in occupancy and ARPOB mix, and strengthening cash flows. Management’s strategy prioritises brownfield expansion, disciplined asset-light growth, and operating leverage from newly acquired and greenfield units.Max Healthcare’s growth is underpinned by a defined expansion pipeline comprising phased brownfield additions, new greenfield hospitals and asset light facilities across major metros and emerging clusters. Momentum is supported by the ramp-up of Dwarka, Noida, Lucknow and Nagpur, continued ARPOB improvement from case-mix enrichment, and rising volumes in oncology, transplants and other high-acuity specialties. The scaling of Max Lab adds further diversified, capital-light growth. As these assets mature and utilisation increases, the FY28 EBITDA base expands meaningfully. Applying a 28x EV/EBITDA multiple to FY28 earnings yields a target price of ₹1218.The stock is in uptrend sustaining above its short- and long-term averages and is forming higher high and higher low in long term charts. The stock is currently breaking above its last 3 weeks highs thus offer fresh entry opportunityThe stock has already taken 7 weeks to retrace just 61.8% of its preceding 5 weeks rally (42-58).

China to get Nvidia H200 chips! Trump admin begins licensing process for exports — Why are officials not happy?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-to-get-nvidia-h200-chips-trump-admin-begins-licensing-process-for-exports-why-are-officials-not-happy/articleshow/126068249.cms,"Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

'A mistake' — Why officials are not happy?



China could receive the first shipments of Nvidia’s second-most powerful AI chips, signalling a shift in America’s long-standing restrictions on exports to Beijing.The US government has began a formal licensing process that could pave the way for chip gaint's Beijing entry, Reuters reported, citing five people familiar with the matter. This comes after US President Donald Trump recently committed to permit sales.Earlier this month, Trump said that his administration would allow Nvidia to sell its H200 chips to China, with the US collecting a 25% fee on the transactions. Explaining the rational behind the permission, he said that exporting American chips would help US companies retain an edge over Chinese chipmakers by reducing the appetite for dragon's chips.However, despite the announcement, uncertainty still surrounds the pace of approvals and whether Chinese authorities would permit local firms to purchase the chips. The move has also drawn sharp criticism from China hawks across the US political spectrum, who argue that the technology could enhance Beijing’s military capabilities and weaken the US lead in artificial intelligence, Reuters reported.According to the sources, the commerce department has forwarded licence applications related to the proposed chip exports to the state, energy and defense departments as part of a mandatory inter-agency review.Under US export regulations, the departments have 30 days to submit their assessments.One administration official stressed that the process would be comprehensive, saying it was “not some perfunctory box we are checking.” However, the regulations, the final green signal still remains with the president.While the White House declined to comment directly on the review, a spokesperson said “the Trump administration is committed to ensuring the dominance of the American tech stack – without compromising on national security.”The potential policy is a transition from the approach taken under former president Joe Biden, whose administration imposed extensive restrictions on exports of advanced AI chips to China and other countries it saw as possible transit points for smuggling, citing national security concerns.It also contrasts sharply with Trump’s stance during his first term, when he moved aggressively to restrict China’s access to US technology. At the time, Trump pointed to allegations that China steals American intellectual property and uses commercially obtained technology to strengthen its military, accusations that Beijing has denied.Former national security officals have firmly opposed the move saying that large chip outflows to China would be ‘a significant strategic mistake,’” said Chris McGuire, who served on the White House National Security Council under President Joe Biden and is now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. He told Reuters that the chips are “the one thing holding China back in AI.”“I cannot possibly fathom how the departments of Commerce, State, Energy, and Defense could certify that exporting these chips to China is in the U.S. national security interest,” he added.Officials backing the policy within the Trump administration argue the exports could have the opposite effect. Led by White House AI czar David Sacks, they say selling advanced chips to China would discourage domestic firms such as Huawei from intensifying efforts to close the gap with Nvidia and AMD’s most advanced designs.Reuters reported last week that Nvidia is considering ramping up production of the H200 chips, which sit just below its flagship Blackwell processors, after initial orders from China exceeded existing manufacturing capacity. Although the H200 is slower than the Blackwell chips across many AI applications, it remains widely used and has never previously been approved for sale in China.Trump had earlier indicated that he was open to allowing exports of a less advanced version of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, but later reversed that position and moved instead to approve potential sales of the H200.",The US government has began a formal licensing process that could pave the way for chip gaint's Beijing entry. This comes after US President Donald Trump recently committed to permit sales. But uncertainty still surrounds the pace of approvals and whether Chinese authorities would permit local firms to purchase the chips.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126068702,imgsize-204906,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
TikTok row: US joint venture deal signed to avert Chinese ownership ban; ByteDance's stake capped at 19.9%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tiktok-row-us-joint-venture-deal-signed-to-avert-chinese-ownership-ban-bytedances-stake-capped-at-19-9/articleshow/126068476.cms,"Representative image

TikTok has signed a joint venture agreement with major investors to keep its platform running in the United States and avoid a potential ban linked to its Chinese ownership, according to an internal memo seen by news agency AFP.TikTok chief executive Shou Zi Chew told employees that the company and its parent ByteDance have agreed to form a new US-based entity, backed by Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investor MGX.The deal is aimed at meeting the requirements of a 2024 US law that mandates the sale of TikTok’s American operations or a shutdown of the app.Under the arrangement, American and global investors will hold just over 80 per cent of the new joint venture, while ByteDance will retain a 19.9 per cent stake — the maximum ownership allowed for a Chinese company under the law, reported Reuters.Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX will each own 15 per cent, while affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will hold around 30 per cent.Chew said the US joint venture would operate as an independent entity with authority over “US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance”.He added that the venture would have “the exclusive right and authority to provide assurances that content, software and data for American users is secure”, as per AFP.Oracle will serve as TikTok’s “trusted security partner”, responsible for auditing compliance and safeguarding sensitive US user data, which will be stored on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure in the United States, Reuters reported.The new entity will also oversee certain commercial operations, including advertising, marketing and e-commerce, while TikTok’s US entities will manage global product interoperability.The agreement is set to close on January 22, 2026, though Chew told staff that more work remains before completion.The memo marks the first confirmation that TikTok has formally signed on to a deal framework unveiled by the White House in September, AFP noted.The move follows years of pressure from US lawmakers, who have argued that TikTok could be used by Beijing to access Americans’ data or influence public opinion through its algorithm.US President Donald Trump, who initially pushed for a ban during his first term, repeatedly delayed enforcement of the law through executive orders since his return to the White House.He has credited TikTok, which has over 170 million US users, with helping him win re-election.Trump has publicly backed the new arrangement, previously naming Oracle founder Larry Ellison — a longtime ally — as a key figure in the deal.Ellison has recently re-emerged in the spotlight through major media and technology investments, AFP reported.The deal has drawn criticism from some US politicians. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said there were still unanswered questions, accusing Trump of allowing a “billionaire takeover” of TikTok, as reported by Reuters.Despite the concerns, analysts quoted by Reuters said the agreement is likely to clear regulatory hurdles, given the level of involvement by the White House in shaping the transaction.",TikTok has signed a joint venture agreement with major investors to keep its platform running in the United States.

'LLMs still find it difficult to pull off complex reasoning tasks',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/llms-still-find-it-difficult-to-pull-off-complex-reasoning-tasks/articleshow/126067075.cms,"BENGALURU: Cognizant AI CTO Babak Hodjat said at the Nasdaq-listed company's AI Lab here that as enterprises race to embed large language models (LLMs) deeper into business operations, a key question remains unresolved: how much can these systems be trusted to reason correctly at scale? While today's LLMs are powerful, he said, they tend to break down when pushed into longer or more complex chains of reasoning, making human oversight and stronger evaluation frameworks essential.Showcasing Cognizant's AI work, Hodjat said the industry was ""far from having a single panacea"" to determine whether an AI system's output could be trusted, especially as companies move towards autonomous, multi-agent systems. Research indicates that even the most advanced LLMs suffer what he described as ""catastrophic breakdowns"" when required to execute long sequences of reasoning steps.To illustrate the problem, Hodjat cited the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, a logically simple task where LLMs begin making errors after a few hundred reasoning steps. This limitation poses risks for enterprises deploying AI across complex workflows such as telecom networks, supply chains or financial systems, where decisions often compound over thousands or even millions of steps.To reduce these risks, Cognizant has embedded multiple human-in-the-loop mechanisms into its AI systems. One method triggers human intervention when an AI system's confidence drops below a predefined threshold.","Cognizant AI CTO Babak Hodjat said the industry was ""far from having a single panacea"" to determine whether an AI system's output could be trusted.

Why Trump’s Gold Card Is Not Getting Traction

Trump Gold card

US President Donald Trump has launched his $1 million Gold Card, but Indians it seems are not too keen to shell out the amount, especially given the lack of clarity on permanent residency. Almost a week after the Trump administration launched its Gold Card visa program, it seems to have garnered little interest. Instead, the EB-5 category of visas seems to be the go-to route for the American dream.The US issues 10,000 EB-5 visas each year, with a limit of 7% or 700 visas per country, including dependents. The EB-5 investor visa program remains in high demand, especially among applicants from India and China, who make up the majority of those seeking this visa.Trump sees the Gold Card as a tool to attract and retain outstanding talent while also creating income for the US government. This new initiative is a permanent residency program, akin to a green card, offering a route to citizenship.""Basically, it's a green card but much better,"" Trump said at the launch. ""Much more powerful, a much stronger path."" But are there any takers?Immigration experts told ET that the Gold Card’s application guidelines are vague.It also lacks legal clarity, and does not offer a clear path to permanent residency or citizenship - a combination of issues that makes it unappealing even to wealthy Indians! These experts are advising applicants to consider the EB-5 category instead.""The instructions for the Gold Card are loosely worded, and there is no clearly defined pathway to permanent residency or citizenship,"" Keshav Singhania, Head of Private Client at Singhania & Co was quoted as saying.To qualify for an EB-5 visa, investors must invest $800,000 in a targeted employment area or $1.05 million elsewhere, and this investment must create at least 10 full-time jobs.This investment covers the entire family, unlike the Gold Card, where each family member must pay $1 million plus a $15,000 processing fee, resulting in a minimum cost of $4 million for a family of four, not including legal fees.Poorvi Chothani, a prominent immigration lawyer, notes that not a single query on the Gold Card has been received till now. ""You will get stuck in the EB-1 and EB-2 queues anyway. At this point, I don’t see this (Gold Card) as an attractive option given the legal and practical uncertainties.""""We have seen significant inbound curiosity, particularly from high-net-worth individuals and global founders. However, this has translated into very limited concrete follow-through,"" said Shilpa Malik, Managing Attorney at US-based VisaLaw Nation. ""We have not yet started processing any formal applications under the program.""""The most likely potential takers, at least in theory, would be ultra-high-net-worth individuals who value long-term US access, optionality, and brand association more than immediate immigration outcomes. That said, this is a very narrow audience,"" she explained.There is also skepticism about the Gold Card in US prediction markets. On Polymarket, about 91% of participants predict that the Trump administration will not sell any Gold Cards in 2025, with over $7 million bet on this outcome.Experts have noted that the Gold Card is not a separate immigration category. ""It does not have its own visa allocation,"" Rajneesh Pathak, founder & CEO of Global North Residency & Citizenship told ET.""The executive order places it within the EB-1 and EB-2 categories, both of which already have significant backlogs. Even if a Gold Card application were submitted today, it would face delays due to the limited availability of visas in these categories, which could discourage potential applicants.""Pathak is of the view that unlike the EB-5 program, which is safeguarded by US law, the Gold Card would need Congressional approval to be enacted. ""Currently, it has been bypassed by Congress. In contrast, EB-5 has explicit grandfathering provisions and is not anticipated to face disruptions,"" he said.Meanwhile, due to stricter H1B visa regulations and other immigration-related changes, there has been a significant increase in demand for EB-5 visas. From January to November 2025, Global North Residency processed over 100 EB-5 applications. Additionally, more than 60 petitions are being filed in just the two months of December 2025 and January 2026.Arindam Sengupta, co-founder of Edufund, emphasized that price sensitivity and certainty are crucial. ""EB-5 has been around for nearly three decades and has a proven track record. The Gold Card lacks both clarity and proof of concept,"" he remarked. ""At a million-dollar price point, people want something tried and tested.""","Trump sees the Gold Card as a tool to attract and retain outstanding talent while also creating income for the US government.

America's holiday season: Festive spending hit as consumers struggle with affordability woes — Here's what report revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/americas-holiday-season-festive-spending-hit-as-consumers-struggle-with-affordability-woes-heres-what-report-revealed/articleshow/126067563.cms,"Americans are rethinking their celebration spending this festive season as household budgets remain under pressure. A large share of the public says that affording holiday purchases this year is proving difficult. Rising costs compared with last year are prompting many to cut down on gifts, leisure activities and travel. At the same time, this strain is most evident among those who feel prices have climbed sharply, highlighting the deep financial divides that have long existed in the country, CBS News reported.Americans who describe their finances in good shape, often those on higher incomes, generally say they can manage seasonal expenses more comfortably. Even among this group, however, there is widespread opinion that the cost of goods and services has gone up, making the holidays more expensive overall.The data from CBS poll shows that only 8% of Americans find that the things they buy for holidays are very easy to afford, while 34% find them somewhat easy to afford. In contrast, a larger share report financial strain, with 41% saying holiday purchases are somewhat difficult to afford and 17% describing them as very difficult to afford.Financial worries are also impacting how people experience this Christmas. While the holidays are typically linked with joy and thankfulness, those struggling to pay for essentials are far more likely to associate the period with stress. Financial pressure, for many, is dampening what would otherwise be a time of celebration.According to the CBS poll, 48% of people felt geatful, 43% felt happy and 29% felt excited. However, 39% of Americans felt stressed, 29% felt exhausted and 23% were feeling sad.With the holiday rush nearing, many consumers have reported that at least gas prices in their area are falling rather than rising, a shift not seen earlier in the year, according to CBS News.In October, 34% of Americans said that gas prices in their area were going up, 12% said they were going down, and 38% felt they were staying the same. Now, fewer people, 20%, say prices are rising, while a much larger 32% report that gas prices are falling, and 33% say they are unchanged.Even so, lower fuel costs have not been enough to significantly change spending behaviour.Only a small proportion of Americans expect to increase spending on gifts, entertainment, flights, or food and drink compared with previous years. Those who find it hard to afford holiday items are especially inclined to scale back while those holding spending steady or planning to spend more are largely those who say their financial position is sound.Though public confidence in the economy has remained weak in 2025, the year has highlighted a persistent split between Americans who feel financially secure and those who do not. For higher-income households, stock market plays an important role in their finances. However, lower-income groups are more affected by rising prices and inflation.The figures show that most Americans feel their income is not keeping pace with inflation. In February, 23% said their income was keeping up, compared with 77% who said it was not. This changed little in July, when 25% felt their income was keeping up and 75% said it was not. Now, 24% say their income is keeping pace with inflation, while 76% say it is not.According to CBS News, almost half of Americans agree that their financial situation is good, while the other half says it is bad, a balance that has remained consistent over the years. Among those who saw their situation changing, more people say it worsened rather than improved, though improvements were more common among higher earners.As 2025 approaches its end, inflation continues to remain a dominant concern. Around three-quarters of Americans throughout the year said their incomes were not keeping pace with rising prices. Views of the overall economy continue to be negative, and opinions on the job market are also unfavourable on balance.","A large share of the public says that affording holiday purchases this year is proving difficult.

Japan inflation holds steady ahead of BoJ rate decision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japan-inflation-holds-steady-ahead-of-boj-rate-decision/articleshow/126067543.cms,"Japan's inflation rate held steady in November, official data showed Friday ahead of the Bank of Japan's monetary policy decision which could see central bankers raise interest rates to their highest level in 30 years.The hike would be the first since January and could potentially exacerbate turmoil in debt markets.Yields on Japanese government bonds have risen in recent weeks on worries about Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's budget discipline, while the yen has weakened.The core consumer price index -- which excludes volatile fresh food -- rose three percent in November, the same rate as a month earlier, in line with market expectations.Takaichi, who formally took power in October, has promised to fight inflation as a major priority.Her government succeeded in getting parliament approval for an extra budget worth 18.3 trillion yen ($118 billion) this week to finance her massive stimulus package.She has long advocated for more government spending and easy monetary policy to spur growth.Since taking office, however, she has said monetary policy decisions should be left to the Bank of Japan (BoJ).The BoJ began hiking rates from below zero in March last year as figures signalled an end to the country's ""lost decades"" of stagnation, with inflation surging.However, with worries about the global outlook and US tariffs growing, the bank paused its tightening measures at the start of 2025, with the last increase in January taking rates to their highest level in 17 years.The inflation figures for November showed rice prices up 37 percent year-on-year, the internal affairs ministry said.Rice prices have skyrocketed because of supply problems linked to a very hot summer in 2023 and panic-buying after a ""megaquake"" warning last year, amongst other factors.Japan's economy contracted 0.6 percent in the third quarter, but BoJ governor Kazuo Ueda said last week that the impact of US tariffs was less than feared.""So far, US corporates have swallowed the burden of tariffs without fully passing (them) through to consumer prices,"" Ueda told the Financial Times.At the same time, inflation has been above the BoJ's target of two percent for some time.The majority of economists polled by Bloomberg expect the BoJ to raise its main rate from 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent, which would be the highest since 1995.","Japan's inflation rate held steady in November, official data showed Friday.

US inflation data: Prices cool in November after shutdown-hit report; relief yet to reach households,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-data-prices-cool-in-november-after-shutdown-hit-report-relief-yet-to-reach-households/articleshow/126062350.cms,"Photo- AP

US inflation cooled more than expected in November, but economists cautioned that the data may have been distorted by the recent federal government shutdown, while most Americans said they were yet to feel any real relief from high prices for essentials, AP reported.The US Labor Department said on Thursday that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on-year in November, lower than forecasts and down from 3% in September. The reading, however, remained well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target, underscoring persistent cost pressures in the economy.The inflation report itself was delayed by eight days because of the 43-day federal shutdown, which also disrupted data collection and prevented the release of CPI numbers for October. As a result, investors, businesses and policymakers received their first official inflation update since late September.Economists warned that the figures should be interpreted with caution. Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, said the data were “likely a bit distorted” due to the shutdown. “The good news is that it’s cooling,” she said, adding that the disruption to government operations and contracting could itself have temporarily dampened price pressures.Similar concerns were raised by Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, who described the November inflation numbers as “noisy”. She said the absence of October data made month-on-month comparisons impossible and the truncated data-gathering process could have introduced systematic biases.As a result, many economists said a clearer picture of inflation trends may only emerge with the December CPI report, due to be released in mid-January, shortly before the Fed’s next policy meeting.While headline inflation eased, energy prices rose 4.2% in November, driven by higher fuel oil costs. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose 2.6% year-on-year, its lowest level since March 2021.Despite the moderation in inflation, consumer sentiment remained strained. High prices for groceries, insurance, utilities and housing have continued to weigh on households, a factor that analysts say has had political repercussions as well.An AP-NORC poll showed that most US adults had noticed unusually high prices for basic goods and holiday purchases in recent months. Roughly half said it was harder than usual to afford gifts, while many reported delaying major purchases or cutting back on non-essential spending.Inflation pressures have been partly attributed to President Donald Trump’s import tariffs, which imposed double-digit taxes on a broad range of imports, alongside targeted duties on steel, aluminium and automobiles. While the tariffs have proved less inflationary than initially feared, economists said they continue to exert upward pressure on prices and complicate the Fed’s policy decisions.The Federal Reserve last week cut interest rates for the third time this year, but signalled it may opt for just one rate cut in 2026, as it balances easing inflation against signs of a slowing job market.Tariffs have also added to uncertainty for businesses. Footwear maker Wolverine Worldwide said higher import costs had forced it to raise prices on some products and freeze hiring and investment. Its chief executive Christopher Hufnagel said the unpredictability of tariff policy had made long-term planning increasingly difficult.","US inflation cooled more than expected in November, but economists cautioned that the data may have been distorted by the recent federal government shutdown.

What Does It Mean For Global Crude Oil Market?

Venezuelan Merey differentials against ICE Brent in China

US President Donald Trump’s latest escalation in tensions and blockade of Venezuela oil tankers may have little impact on the global crude oil market, believes global real-time data and analytics provider Kpler. “The move has so far failed to provide a meaningful boost to oil prices or to overturn underlying fundamentals, largely because the market is two-tiered and even the sanctioned segment remains crowded,” says Kpler in its latest report.In 2025, Venezuela is producing approximately 900,000 barrels per day (kbd) of crude oil and condensate, which makes up about 1% of the global oil supply. Of the 765,000 barrels per day that Venezuela exports, around 76% is sent to China, specifically to independent refiners known as teapot refiners. This is because state-owned companies are avoiding these shipments due to concerns over sanctions.The United States has received about 17% of Venezuela's exports this year, a decrease from 35% in 2024, following changes to Chevron’s license. The rest of the exports are sent to Cuba and a few other countries like Spain and Italy under previous agreements.On Tuesday, Trump announced a ""blockade"" on all sanctioned oil tankers traveling to and from Venezuela.This move is part of America’s ongoing efforts to increase pressure on Nicolas Maduro's government by targeting its primary revenue source.Details on how Trump plans to enforce this blockade on the sanctioned vessels remain unclear. It is also uncertain whether he will deploy the Coast Guard to intercept these ships. The Trump administration has already positioned thousands of troops and nearly a dozen warships, including an aircraft carrier, in the region.Trump said on Truth Social, ""For the theft of our Assets, and many other reasons, including Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking, the Venezuelan Regime has been designated a FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. Therefore, today, I am ordering A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela.""The increased US pressure on Venezuela might have added some geopolitical risk to Brent crude prices. However, this is unlikely to significantly change overall market sentiment, says Kpler. The reason is simple: disruptions to Venezuelan supply impact only a small group of buyers, and the global market is well-supplied to handle any potential shortages from US actions.Trump’s statement about blocking “all sanctioned oil tankers” suggests that shipments considered legitimate, such as those going to the US under Chevron’s license, might continue without disruption. This indicates that Venezuelan oil supplies to sanctioned markets could face interruptions, while shipments to the US would likely remain unaffected, points out Kpler.However, cargoes headed to China and Cuba could be hit. According to data from Kpler, Cuba imports about 28,000 barrels per day of crude oil in 2025, with roughly 35% coming from Venezuela. Most of the rest is supplied by Mexico, with Russia and Algeria each providing one shipment.If Venezuela's supply becomes unreliable, Cuba might see immediate challenges. However, with the availability of Russian oil—despite recent US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil—Cuba could potentially look to Russia to make up for any shortfall.Chinese teapot refiners are likely to feel the effects of any oil blockade due to their reliance on Venezuelan crude. However, the impact of shipment disruptions is expected to be lessened by the high volumes of Venezuelan oil currently in transit and the ample supply from Iran, Russia, and other non-sanctioned producers, says Kpler.Market sources quoted in the Kpler report indicate that prompt Venezuelan Merey cargoes are trading at about $15 below ICE Brent on a delivered China basis, even after the US seized a Venezuelan oil tanker last week. Sellers have attempted to raise prices to around $13 below ICE Brent, but the abundant Iranian supply and a sharp drop in Russian oil prices in China have kept Venezuelan prices from rising.Many Iranian heavy cargoes, such as Pars (around $12.5 below ICE Brent) and Iran Heavy (around $11.5 below ICE Brent), remain unsold, which is likely to limit any increase in Venezuelan prices in China. Both the sanctioned and non-sanctioned oil markets are experiencing a significant supply surplus, with buyers becoming less sensitive to geopolitical developments.According to Kpler data, the floating storage of Iranian, Venezuelan, and Russian crude oil has reached a combined 74 million barrels this week, the highest level since November 2022.","US President Donald Trump's latest escalation in tensions and blockade of Venezuela oil tankers may have little impact on the global crude oil market, says Kpler.

While inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, the softer reading raised hopes that the central bank could continue cutting interest rates next year to support a slowing job market.Some caution persisted with market participants noting that recent economic data have been volatile following the US government shutdown, and that upcoming inflation reports may provide a clearer signal.Technology stocks got a further boost from Micron Technology, which surged nearly 16% after posting stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue and issuing an upbeat outlook. Chief executive Sanjay Mehrotra said demand linked to artificial intelligence accelerated across Micron’s businesses, reinforcing its role as a key “AI enabler”.The results helped ease worries that heavy spending on AI by major companies may not yield sufficient returns.

"Trump speech signals high tariffs, higher walls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-speech-signals-high-tariffs-higher-walls/articleshow/126060074.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

'India Got Out Of The Gates Faster Than Most Nations', Says US Expert As Trade Deal Talks Nears End

In an animated prime time address from the Diplomatic Room in the White House on Wednesday night that was anything but diplomatic, President Donald Trump doubled down on a protectionist agenda that is sending ripples through the global financial system, emphasizing the benefits of broad tariffs and steep reductions in immigration to the US, while promising Americans that better days are ahead.The 18-minute speech, delivered in combative and at times aggrieved tone, largely blamed the Biden administration and undocumented immigrants for persistent affordability challenges in America while promising a transformative boom in 2026, even as the President’s approval rating continued to tank amid fissures in the MAGA movement. He began his speech with, “Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess, and I’m fixing it. ”Characterizing his ""America First"" policies as a necessary correction to a globalist rot that he claims has hollowed out the American middle class, Trump blended nativist populism with sketchy economic policy, announcing a $1,776 ""Warrior Dividend"" to nearly 1.5 million military personnel, ostensibly to commemorate the founding of the country in 1776. These end-of-year bonuses, he said, would be funded in part by tariff revenues, framing his favorite policy prescription as a transfer of wealth from foreign competitors to American patriots.The President directly linked the housing crisis and rising rental costs to the previous administration's immigration policies, alleging that 60% of rental market growth was driven by foreign migrants—a dodgy stat contested by fact-checkers, like many similar claims such as an $ 18 trillion foreign investment in the US. By framing immigration as a purely economic drain, Trump signaled that his administration will continue to pursue restrictive policies that challenge the globalist ideal of fluid labor markets.The address was notable not just for its content, but for its tone. Eschewing the traditional ""holiday unity"" message, Trump excoriated political opponents and ""special interests"" for the current cost-of-living anxieties, frequently appearing angry.“For the last four years, the United States was ruled by politicians who fought only for insiders, illegal aliens, career criminals, corporate lobbyists, prisoners, terrorists and, above all, foreign nations, which took advantage of us at levels never seen before. They flooded your cities and towns with illegal aliens. They decimated your hard-earned savings. They indoctrinated your children with hate for America,” he raged.The President also took aim at the US Federal Reserve, announcing he would soon nominate a new chair who would aggressively lower interest rates. This move is seen by global analysts as a potential threat to the independence of the central bank, whose cues move the world markets.The address offered few new policy details, focusing instead on rebutting public skepticism about economic conditions. Despite Trump's optimism, polls indicate widespread voter anxiety over inflation and costs, with many attributing persistent high prices partly to tariff-induced supply chain frictions.For global markets and international partners, the speech served as a stark reminder that the era of traditional multilateralism is over. It focused heavily on three pillars: aggressive tariff structures, a drastic reversal of immigration flows, and a vision of an economic boom fueled by domestic manufacturing. Defying warnings from economists about inflationary pressure and supply chain disruptions, the President argued that duties on foreign goods have successfully forced corporations to come home to the United States.The speech also reinforced perceptions of US retrenchment from multilateral engagement. While the President recycled his familiar claim of having settled ""eight wars in ten months,"" his rhetoric suggests a country that is increasingly insular, viewing the world not as a community of partners, but as a series of competitors to be out-negotiated or excluded through high walls and higher tariffs.","President Donald Trump delivered an animated prime time address from the Diplomatic Room in the White House on Wednesday night.

"Wall Street in 2026: How will US stock market perform next year? AI boom, rate cuts & more in focus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-in-2026-how-will-us-stock-market-perform-next-year-ai-boom-rate-cuts-more-in-focus/articleshow/126052879.cms,"What will fuel the rally in 2026?



In 2025, Wall Street recorded new highs.Investors did not pay attention to the worries about Trump administration's massive tariffs and the AI bubble concerns.The S&P 500 benchmark skyrocketed 15% so far this year, till December 17. S&P 500, another benchmark however, lagged behind its 23% jump last year. The S&P 500 has done well over the ten years, giving traders a gain of around 13% every year, Mark Luschini investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott told CBS News.Tech heavy index Nasdaq Composite has gone up by than 18% in 2025, on the back of players like Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia. At the same time, Dow Jones Industrial Average has also gone up by over 13%.The big question is whether this rally will sustain its momentum into the next year.""I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,"" Luschini said, adding ""the big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.""Several major forecasters remain upbeat about the outlook. David Lefkowitz, head of US equities at UBS global wealth management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday at 6,816 points to climb to 7,300 by June next year and reach 7,700 by the end of 2026.That would imply gains of roughly 15% over the coming year.JP Morgan also maintained an optimistic tone in a November research report, projecting the S&P 500 to rise between 13% and 15% next year on the back of strong corporate earnings growth, with that momentum extending into 2027.Analysts say a fresh round of earnings growth is likely to be a key driver of markets in 2026, especially within the technology sector. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to expand at a mid-double-digit pace next year.“Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,” the firm said in its market forecast, cited by 2026. “In 2026, earnings will do the lift.”The AI boom is also expected to continue fuelling equities. Capital spending by major technology firms, including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle, is projected to approach $520 billion in 2026, according to Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. Such investment is expected to support not only tech stocks but also industrial companies supplying equipment for data centres.Beyond AI-linked names, some analysts see the rally broadening across the market. Bret Kenwell, a US investment and options analyst at eToro, said all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 could rise next year.“That’s something we haven’t seen,” he said. “If it happens, it’ll have been five years since we’ve seen it.”Financial services stocks may also perform well. Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both pointed to banks, which have traded strongly this year amid a more relaxed regulatory environment and increased merger and acquisition activity.Monetary policy could provide an additional boost. Kenwell said a softer stance from the Federal Reserve may support markets, particularly as President Trump is expected to nominate a new Fed chair before Jerome Powell’s term ends in May.“It’s kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,” Kenwell said.However, expectations are for rate cuts to slow. JP Morgan forecasts one more cut in January, followed by an extended pause. The bank added that further easing could see the S&P 500 push beyond 8,000 points in 2026.Despite the optimism, artificial intelligence remains the biggest source of uncertainty hanging over markets. AI and tech stocks have driven much of this year’s gains, with the so-called “Magnificent Seven” delivering earnings growth far ahead of the rest of the index. That surge has been matched by heavy capital investment in data centres and related infrastructure, CBS reported.“Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,” Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in the firm’s 2026 outlook on capital investment.Even so, concerns persist that enthusiasm around AI could cool, triggering a market correction. Vanguard, in its 2026 outlook, said US technology stocks should retain momentum due to continued investment and earnings growth, while cautioning that “risks are growing” amid widespread optimism.Crisafulli noted that tech stocks have historically moved together, but that pattern began to fracture in November. Alphabet shares jumped 14% following the launch of Google Gemini 3, even as the broader Nasdaq declined. He said this divergence highlights a potential challenge for investors next year.“It’s not so much the bubbles bursting,” he said. “It’s more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.”Volatility, analysts warn, is still likely to make an appearance. After months of steady gains, markets could face periods of consolidation or modest pullbacks, Kenwell said.“When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that’s something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,” he said.","S&P 500 has done well over the ten years, giving traders a gain of around 13% every year. The big question is whether this rally will sustain its momentum into the next year.

'More money in your wallets'

Impact of tax cuts

Electricity prices to fall



Lower interest and housing reforms



US President Donald Trump said that America is headed for an ""economic boom"" in the upcoming year. Speaking at the White House on Wednesday (local time), Trump highlighted his achievements of during the second term and outlined the administration’s plans for the economy, border security and the United States’ role on the global stage.For the upcoming year, Trump made a range of promises, ranging from lower mortage for Americans to expanding the country's energy resources.Trump said that the country would begin to see tangible financial benefits from his policies. He told viewers, “You will see in your wallets and bank accounts in the new year, after years of record-setting falling incomes, our policies are boosting take-home pay at a historic pace.”Looking ahead, Trump pointed to tax policy as a central pillar of his economic agenda. He said the next year would reflect the impact of what he called “the largest tax cuts in American history”, delivered through “our great, big, beautiful bill — perhaps the most sweeping legislation ever passed in Congress”.On energy, Trump said his administration was preparing for an unprecedented expansion in electricity production.He claimed that “within the next 12 months, we will have opened 1,600 new electrical generating plants”, describing it as a record unlikely to be surpassed soon. According to Trump, “prices on electricity and everything else” will also “fall dramatically”.The President also focused on interest rates and housing, saying he would soon announce a new chair of the Federal Reserve who supported significantly lower borrowing costs. “And I'll soon announce our next chairman of the Federal Reserve, someone who believes in lower interest rates by a lot,” he said, adding that mortgage payments would continue to come down. He further promised major policy changes in the property sector, saying that early in the new year he would unveil “some of the most aggressive housing reform plans in American history”.Turning to America’s standing abroad, Trump said the country had regained respect under his leadership. “America is respected. And our country is back, stronger than ever before,” he said, claiming the US was on the brink of an economic expansion “the likes of which the world has never seen”.","US President Donald Trump said that America is headed for an ""economic boom"" in the upcoming year.

Nikkei also trimmed over 422 points to reach 49,089. Kospi also lost 1.39% to reach 3,999.Expectations of a year-end rally have weakened after the US Federal Reserve last week suggested it may pause interest rate cuts as early as next month. Although the central bank’s three consecutive reductions had supported equities in recent months, investors are increasingly wary that the policy tailwind could be coming to an end.With uncertainty building, markets are now looking ahead to key US inflation data due later on Thursday for clues on the Fed’s next move. A US jobs report released earlier this week did little to clarify the outlook for monetary policy.The spotlight has returned to technology stocks, where fears are growing that valuations may have overshot fundamentals. Tech and chipmakers have been the driving force behind this year’s rally to record highs, but scepticism is rising over how long earnings can justify the heavy capital being poured into AI and when meaningful returns will emerge.Those concerns intensified on Wednesday following reports that private capital firm Blue Owl had withdrawn from Oracle’s planned $10 billion data centre, raising doubts over the project’s future. The development came soon after Oracle and semiconductor major Broadcom reported weaker-than-expected earnings last week.Markets reacted sharply. Oracle shares slid more than five per cent on Wednesday, while Broadcom also moved lower. Losses spread across the sector, dragging down major names such as Nvidia, Alphabet and Advanced Micro Devices.The technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.8%, and the S&P 500 declined by more than one per cent.Elsewhere, oil prices climbed more than one per cent for a second consecutive day after the US said its forces had struck a vessel in the Pacific Ocean that Washington claims was involved in drug trafficking, killing four people described as “narco-terrorists”.The development added to tensions surrounding Venezuela after US President Donald Trump ordered a blockade of oil tankers labelled as “sanctioned” while heading to and from the country. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has accused Washington of pursuing regime change rather than focusing on its stated aim of curbing drug trafficking.","Hong Kong's HSI was trading below 111 points or 0.44% at 25,357.

Trump’s favourite word — Tariffs!



Fuels, food, wages — What changed in Trump’s term?



US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) delivered a live address from the White House, highlighting the financial and economic achievements he achieved in his second term. Much of the speech centred on inflation, trade policy, tariffs and household finances, alongside sharp criticism of the previous Democrat administration.Beginning his address, Trump highlighted that he took office at a time of severe economic strain, arguing that Americans were struggling with high prices and declining affordability.“America, 11 months ago, I inherited a mess and I'm fixing it. When I took office, inflation was the worst in 48 years, and some would say in the history of our country, which caused prices to be higher than ever before, making life unaffordable for millions and millions of Americans. This happened during a Democrat administration, and it's when we first began hearing the word affordability,” he said.The president repeatedly targeted the Biden administration over inflation and public spending, accusing it of draining the US treasury and driving up everyday costs.He went on to criticise earlier trade deals, saying that the United States had lost economic standing on the global stage. However, after Trump began his second term as a president, the country was no longer being “laughed at"" from all over the world.He highlighted what he described as record levels of investment flowing into the United States, linking this directly to his trade and tariff policies. “Already, I've secured a record-breaking $18 trillion of investment into the United States, which means jobs, wage increases, growth, factory openings, and far greater national security,” he said.He described tariffs as a central tool of his economic strategy, arguing that they had encouraged companies to relocate manufacturing back to the US.“Much of this success has been accomplished by tariffs, my favorite word, tariffs, which, for many decades, have been used successfully by other countries against us, but not anymore. Companies know that if they build in America, there are no tariffs, and that's why they're coming home to the USA in record numbers. They're building factories and plants at levels we haven't seen, AI, automobiles.”The US President claimed that the economic turnaround had been dramatic.“We're doing what nobody thought was even possible, not even remotely possible. There has never, frankly, been anything like it. One year ago, our country was dead. We were absolutely dead. Our country was ready to fail. Totally failed.”Alongside foreign policy claims, the president said the domestic economy had been brought back “from the brink of ruin”, again blaming previous leadership for rising prices across key sectors.“The last administration and their allies in Congress looted our Treasury for trillions of dollars, driving up prices and everything at levels never seen before. I am bringing those high prices down and bringing them down very fast,” he said.Trump listed a series of price increases he attributed to the Biden years, including cars, fuel, hotel rates and airfares, before claiming those costs were now falling.“Under the Biden administration, car prices rose 22% and, in many states, 30% or more. Gasoline rose 30 to 50%. Hotel rates rose 37%. Airfares rose 31%. Now, under our leadership, they are all coming down and coming down fast.”He also referred to food prices, citing declines in the cost of groceries.“The price of a Thanksgiving turkey was down 33% compared to the Biden last year. The price of eggs is down 82 percent since March, and everything else is falling rapidly. And it's not done yet, but, boy, are we making progress.”Energy costs featured prominently in the speech, with Trump saying households had borne heavy losses under the previous administration.“Electricity costs surged 30 to 100 percent under Biden. And the typical family lost $5,000 to $10,000 in higher energy costs,” he said, adding that he had declared a national energy emergency on his first day in office.He claimed fuel prices had since dropped sharply. “Gasoline is now under $2.50 a gallon in much of the country. In some states, it, by the way, just hit $1.99 a gallon.”Turning to wages and incomes, Trump said his policies were boosting take-home pay after years of decline.“After years of record-setting falling incomes, our policies are boosting take-home pay at a historic pace,” he said, adding that “under Biden, real wages plummeted by $3,000”.He said factory workers were now seeing wage increases of $1,300, while construction workers were gaining $1,800, stressing that “wages are going up much faster than inflation”.The president also highlighted a major tax package, describing it as “one beautiful bill”, which combined multiple measures including “no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors”.He said these changes would save many families between $11,000 and $20,000 a year and lead to what he described as the largest tax refund season on record.Linking tariffs to government revenue, Trump announced a special payment for military personnel.“Because of tariffs, along with the just-passed, one big, beautiful bill, tonight I am also proud to announce that more than 1,450,000 — think of this, 1,450,000 — military service members will receive a special we call warrior dividend before Christmas,” he said.“We are sending every soldier $1,776,” he added, stating that the payments were already being issued.Closing his address, Trump said the combination of falling prices, rising wages and trade-driven revenue had restored America’s economic position.“Wages are up. Prices are down. Our nation is strong. America is respected. And our country is back, stronger than ever before. We're poised for an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen.”","US President Donald Trump delivered a live address from the White House on Wednesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 171 points, while the Nasdaq composite was flat. Shares of oil producers led gains as US crude climbed 1.4%, clawing back some losses after sliding to its lowest level since 2021 in the previous session.The move in oil followed Trump’s order to block sanctioned Venezuelan tankers, a step that came after US forces last week seized an oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

"Find less costly ways to address pension concerns instead of OPS, says Raghuram Rajan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/find-less-costly-ways-to-address-pension-concerns-instead-of-ops-says-raghuram-rajan/articleshow/98457871.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme and suggested that some less costly ways should be found to address the demands of government pensioners.Rajan further said the old pension scheme does involve massive future outlays because of the indexation of pensions to current salaries.""This is an enormous obligation, not necessarily in the short run, but in the long run,"" he said, adding obviously, state governments have to think through the long-term implications for government finances, and whether civil servants are the most in need of help among the constituencies they deal with.Rajan, currently Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said as he understands it, it may be infeasible technically or legally to move back to the old pension scheme.""If so, there may be less costly ways of addressing the concerns that prompt such moves,"" Rajan told PTI in an email interview.In a major move, a select group of central government employees have been given a one-time option to opt for old pension scheme.The employees who joined the central government services against posts advertised or notified before December 22, 2003, the day National Pension System ( NPS ) was notified, are eligible to join the old pension scheme under the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 (now 2021).Under Old Pension Scheme (OPS), employees get a defined pension. An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

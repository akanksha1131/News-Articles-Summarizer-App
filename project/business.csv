He also lauded the participation of industry, states, innovators, academia and technology partners at the conference.Khattar appreciated the AI and ML-based solutions showcased by distribution companies, advanced metering infrastructure service providers, technology solution providers and home automation solution providers, noting their potential to transform both consumer experience and operational efficiency.He highlighted applications such as smart meter analytics, digital twins, predictive maintenance, theft detection intelligence, appliance-level consumer insights, automated outage prediction and GenAI-based decision support as key enablers of intelligent, self-optimising and consumer-centric distribution networks.According to the minister, AI and ML solutions can restore consumer trust, help households manage consumption, prevent outages, protect honest consumers from theft-related costs, and enable DISCOMs to reduce losses, optimise power purchase costs and reinvest in infrastructure—positioning India as a global leader in digital electricity reform and future-ready grid governance.Speaking at the conference, Power Secretary Pankaj Agarwal said the ministry remained committed to deepening digitalisation across DISCOMs and promoting AI and ML adoption that delivers measurable operational and financial gains.Agarwal stressed the importance of capacity building, secure data-sharing frameworks and interoperability to ensure solutions demonstrated at the conference can be scaled nationwide to support India’s energy transition.","India’s power distribution companies need to move faster towards intelligent, reliable and consumer-focused networks.

Aadhaar checks: UIDAI plans rule to mandate registration for verifiers; push paperless verification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/aadhaar-checks-uidai-plans-rule-to-mandate-registration-for-verifiers-push-paperless-verification/articleshow/125817432.cms,"Aadhaar-based verification is set to move further away from paper trails, with the Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ) preparing to notify a new rule mandating registration of entities that seek offline Aadhaar verification, reported PTIThe proposed rule aims to discourage practices such as hotels, event organisers and similar entities collecting photocopies of Aadhaar cards and storing them physically — a process that is already in contravention of the Aadhaar Act, a senior government official told PTI.UIDAI chief executive officer Bhuvnesh Kumar said the authority has approved a framework under which entities seeking offline Aadhaar verification will be required to register. Once registered, they will gain access to new technology tools that allow verification through QR code scanning or via a new Aadhaar app currently under development.“The new rule has been approved by the authority and will be notified soon. It will mandate registration of offline verification-seeking entities like hotels, event organisers. The objective is to discourage paper-based Aadhaar verification,” Kumar said.He said the move will also address operational issues caused by downtime of intermediary servers that connect entities to the central Aadhaar database. Under the revised system, registered entities will be provided access to application programming interfaces (APIs) to integrate offline Aadhaar verification into their systems.UIDAI is also beta-testing a new app that will enable app-to-app Aadhaar verification without requiring connection to the central Aadhaar database for each transaction. The app is expected to be used in places such as airports and retail outlets selling age-restricted products.“The ease of verification will enhance offline verification without the use of paper while maintaining privacy of users or any risk of their Aadhaar data getting leaked for misuse,” Kumar said.According to him, the app is expected to fine-tune Aadhaar authentication services in line with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, which is slated to become fully operational within the next 18 months.The app will also allow users to update address proof documents and add family members to the same platform, including those who do not own a mobile phone, he added.","The proposed rule aims to discourage practices such as hotels, event organisers and similar entities collecting photocopies of Aadhaar cards and storing them physically.

A visiting European Union delegation will meet commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Monday to review progress in negotiations on the proposed India-EU free trade agreement (FTA), as both sides push to conclude talks within a year-end deadline, an official told PTI. The meeting comes amid efforts to narrow differences in critical areas covering both goods and services, with the EU team, led by Sabine Weyand of the Directorate-General for Trade, holding discussions in New Delhi to iron out outstanding issues.“The EU team will meet the minister on Monday,” the official said, adding that some gaps still remain in areas such as steel, carbon tax, automobiles and non-tariff barriers.India and the 27-nation EU bloc had resumed negotiations in June 2022 for a comprehensive FTA, an investment protection agreement and a pact on geographical indications after talks were stalled in 2013 due to differences over market access.The EU is currently India’s largest trading partner in goods. Bilateral trade stood at $ 136.53 billion in 2024-25, with Indian exports at $ 75.85 billion and imports at $ 60.68 billion.The EU accounts for about 17 per cent of India’s total exports, while shipments to India make up around 9 per cent of the bloc’s overseas exports.Besides seeking significant duty cuts on automobiles and medical devices, the EU is pressing for tariff reductions on products such as wine, spirits, meat and poultry, along with a strong intellectual property regime.Indian exports to the EU — including readymade garments, pharmaceuticals, steel, petroleum products and electrical machinery — could gain competitiveness if the agreement is finalised.The India-EU trade pact negotiations span 23 chapters, covering areas such as trade in goods and services, investment, rules of origin, customs and trade facilitation, government procurement, dispute settlement, intellectual property rights and geographical indications, according to officials.",EU delegation will meet commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Monday.

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are exhibiting weakness, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities. Here recommends a sell on rise strategy for investors:Gold futures on MCX traded near ₹1,30,000, showing signs of weakness after failing to sustain above the immediate resistance zone. Price action suggests that momentum is tilting in favor of sellers as the short-term averages flatten and oscillators indicate a lack of bullish conviction. The technical setup supports a sell-on-rise strategy near ₹1,30,400, with a stop-loss at ₹1,31,500 and potential downside targets around ₹1,29,000.Moving Averages (EMA 8 & EMA 21): The 8 EMA has flattened and is trending close to the 21 EMA, signaling loss of momentum and indecision in the short term. A failure to reclaim the ₹1,30,750–₹1,31,000 region will likely keep the bias negative for the session.Gold prices have slipped below the mid-bollinger band, confirming a shift to mild bearishness. The lower Bollinger band near ₹1,29,200 could act as the next support if selling pressure intensifies.•⁠ ⁠Resistance Levels: ₹1,30,750 – ₹1,31,130 – ₹1,31,500•⁠ ⁠Support Levels: ₹1,29,800 – ₹1,29,300 – ₹1,29,000Repeated rejection near the upper pivots suggests a short-term top formation, strengthening the case for a downside move.The RSI is currently at 50.3, showing neutral momentum but with no signs of strength, implying limited upside potential and scope for corrective pressure.The MACD remains below the signal line, reflecting continued bearish sentiment. The histogram shows weak buying pressure, indicating that any bounce may remain short-lived.•⁠ ⁠Strategy: Sell on rise•⁠ ⁠Entry Zone: ₹1,30,400 – ₹1,30,450•⁠ ⁠Stop-Loss: ₹1,31,500•⁠ ⁠Targets: ₹1,29,300 and ₹1,29,000•⁠ ⁠Bias: Bearish below ₹1,30,750; sustained trade below ₹1,29,800 could accelerate downside momentum.Gold’s intraday structure remains weak with flattening EMAs, a neutral RSI, and a bearish MACD crossover. The repeated rejection near upper resistance reinforces a short-term bearish bias. Traders are advised to adopt a sell-on-rise strategy near ₹1,30,400, keeping a strict stop-loss at ₹1,31,500 and targeting ₹1,29,000. Sustained weakness below ₹1,29,800 could open further downside potential toward ₹1,28,800.","Gold prices are exhibiting weakness, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

Adani Enterprises rights issue: Trading picks up pace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-enterprises-rights-issue-trading-picks-up-pace/articleshow/125824108.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Trading in rights entitlements (REs) for Adani Enterprises picked up pace in the last two sessions of the week as the closing date for the Rs 25,000-crore issue neared. In the last two sessions, nearly 50 lakh rights entitlements were traded on the two exchanges with the price moving up by 23%. The offer is set to close on December 10.REs are the digital coupons that are issued to existing shareholders by a company that is going for a rights offer to raise money from those shareholders. If a shareholder decides not to participate in the rights offer, they can sell the REs in the market and monetise such rights at a market-determined price. When a company launches a rights offer, exchanges create a special, short-term trading window for trading in REs.In the Adani Enterprises rights offer, for every 25 shares that a shareholder was holding on the record date (Nov 17), the shareholder was eligible to buy three more shares in the offer. Each rights share is being offered at Rs 1,800, while the current market price is Rs 2,265.Sources said that given the substantial discount to the rights offer price over the current market price, most institutions would subscribe to the offer.The US-based fund GQG, one of the long-term bulls in some of the Adani Group companies, currently holds about 6% in Adani Enterprises. The fund will pick up additional shares in the rights offer. Among the other large investors, domestic life insurance major LIC, and IHC of Abu Dhabi, both holding about 4% each in the company, are also investing in the rights offer, sources said. A host of mutual funds that hold about 3.5% are also subscribing to the offer.Promoters, who hold 74% in the company, had said that they will subscribe to their full quota in the offer. Retail investors hold about 8% and most of the trading in REs are by this group of investors, market players said.The price history of Adani Enterprises' REs shows that the special trading window on NSE and BSE opened on Nov 25. Initially the price had shot up as high as Rs 680, slid through the days to Rs 350 on December 3 and then again jumped to close at Rs 431 on December 5.Usually, trading in REs closes 3-4 days before the close of the rights offer. The company said it will use the proceeds for repayment of loans, perpetual debt instruments that it had issued, apart from those by its arm, Adani Airport Holdings.","Nearly 50 lakh rights entitlements were traded on the two exchanges.

CEO and billionaire Elon Musk denied news reports that his rocket and satellite maker SpaceX is seeking a $800 billion valuation through a share sale.“There has been a lot of press claiming SpaceX is raising money at $800B, which is not accurate,” Musk said in a post Saturday on his social media platform X. “SpaceX has been cash flow positive for many years and does periodic stock buybacks twice a year to provide liquidity for employees and investors,” he said.This comes after reports claimed that SpaceX is set to reach a $800 billion valuation as it'll launch a new secondary share sale. Hitting that mark would make the rocket maker the most valuable private company in the US, surpassing OpenAI.Executives had also said the company is weighing an IPO next year — a move investors have long anticipated. SpaceX has become a critical partner for the US government, launching satellites and astronauts, while its Starlink broadband network is widely used around the world, including in remote parts of the US and in the war in Ukraine.Starlink now has over eight million active customers, a factor many investors believe is driving SpaceX’s surging valuation, the Wall Street Journal had reported.The Texas-based company continues to fly missions for commercial satellite operators and for US agencies including NASA, the Pentagon and the intelligence community, while also launching its own satellites. Around 9,000 Starlink satellites are now in low-Earth orbit, providing high-speed internet to homes, businesses and airlines.SpaceX is also developing a service that will connect satellites directly to mobile phones. To support that effort, the company has agreed to buy spectrum from EchoStar, committing over $20 billion in cash, stock and debt to secure the rights.","Elon Musk denies reports that his rocket and satellite maker SpaceX is seeking a $800 billion valuation through a share sale. “There has been a lot of press claiming SpaceX is raising money at $800B, which is not accurate,” Musk said in a post Saturday on his social media platform X.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125817420,imgsize-541064,width-400,resizemode-4/article-75.jpg"

Asian borrowers have begun turning their backs on the US, reaching out to other alternatives for fundraising as they aim to avoid US President Donald Trump's tariffs. Now, they have turned towards Europe, pouring billions of dollars in bond issuance, hinting at a possible erosion of America’s dominance in global capital raising.Bloomberg data shows that 23% of Asia Pacific bond sales across euros and dollars this year were denominated in euros, the highest on record and six percentage points above 2024 levels. Companies and governments from the region have issued $100.7 billion of euro notes in 2025, representing a 75% jump from last year, and several of those deals emerged as the most oversubscribed in Europe’s publicly syndicated debt market during their launch week.The US dollar still sits at the top currency for funding, and Asian borrowers have increased dollar-denominated issuance by 29% this year. But the greenback’s share has slipped, reflecting a gradual narrowing of its long-held financing advantage.“A key driver is the need to diversify away from US dollar concentration,” said Daniel Kim, co-head of debt capital markets for Asia Pacific at HSBC told Bloomberg.“This year’s surge in euro-denominated bond issuance stems from a confluence of strategic motives that go beyond the routine refinancing.”Investors have also been unsettled by Trump’s continued pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates despite persistent inflation concerns. Confidence in the dollar’s pre-eminence has weakened, and with the greenback falling 11% against the euro, investor appetite has moved to euro assets. Asian borrowers have followed that shift, expanding issuance to meet demand, Bloomberg reported.“De-dollarization or diversification of investment portfolios to have more deployment in non-dollar currencies is a theme we have witnessed this year,” Ben Wang, head of offshore China debt capital markets at Deutsche Bank AG said. The expert further added that while the euro accounted for only a small portion of Deutsche Bank’s APAC bond trading early in the year, it rose to “more than 10%, even 20%” after the second half began.Lower funding costs have also encouraged Asian borrowers to tap Europe, with euro markets now providing financing more cheaply than dollars or domestic currencies for some issuers. The premium for swapping euros into dollars has fallen to 3.1 basis points, nearing a five-year low, according to Bloomberg data.Forecasts of the dollar losing its reserve-currency status have repeatedly proven wrong, and greenback issuance has surged for years. The long-term shift remains uncertain. As of June, 63% of bonds issued outside borrowers’ home currencies were denominated in dollars, up 20 percentage points since late 2007, according to the Bank for International Settlements. During the same period, the euro’s share fell from 32% to 25%.Still, the resurgence of the euro among Asian borrowers reflects what Martin Schulz, chief economist at Fujitsu Ltd. in Japan, describes as a rebalancing after years of dollar dominance. “We have a more multipolar world,” he said.Several landmark euro deals have reinforced the trend. China’s €4 billion sale drew more than €100 billion in bids, while Japanese telecom group NTT Inc. completed a €5.5 billion fundraising, the largest corporate euro issue from Asia in 2025.“It gives you a broader market to invest in, with cash flows from different regions and different types of companies,” said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for core investments at Axa Investment Managers in London. “It is a fairly healthy development.”The pipeline shows no signs of slowing. Deutsche Bank’s APAC head of credit analysis Owen Gallimore expects Asian euro issuance to rise to $125 billion in 2026, representing growth of more than 20%.“We see issuers on the whole looking to expand their footprint, not just within Asia but also outside, with Europe continuing to be a key marketplace,” said Henry Loh, head of Asia credit at Aberdeen Investments.“We expect to see growing interest in euro issuance to finance this growth.”",23% of Asia Pacific bond sales across euros and dollars this year were denominated in euros.

"Volkswagen capex recalibration: Automaker pares 2030 investment to $186 bn; China, US headwinds grow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/volkswagen-capex-recalibration-automaker-pares-2030-investment-to-186-bn-china-us-headwinds-grow/articleshow/125805954.cms,"Volkswagen Group plans to invest €160 billion ($186 billion) through 2030, a scaled-down outlay that reflects tightening capital allocation as Europe’s largest automaker grapples with mounting pressure in its two biggest markets — China and the United States, Reuters reported.The investment figure, announced by Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume, is part of the company’s rolling five-year capital expenditure plan, which is updated annually. The latest commitment compares with €165 billion earmarked for 2025–2029 and €180 billion for 2024–2028, with 2024 marking the peak year for spending.Since that peak, the group — which houses brands such as Porsche and Audi — has been squeezed by higher costs and weaker margins, hit by US tariffs on imported vehicles and intensifying competition in China. The strain has been felt most acutely at Porsche, which derives nearly half of its sales from the US and China combined.Porsche recently unveiled a significant rollback of its electric vehicle strategy as profits came under pressure. Speaking to Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, Blume said the focus of the latest investment plan was firmly “on Germany and Europe,” particularly in products, technology and infrastructure.Blume added that discussions on an extended savings programme at Porsche are expected to continue into 2026. He also said he does not expect Porsche to grow in China, though localising production across the wider Volkswagen group remains an option. A China-specific Porsche model could make sense at some point, he said.On Audi, Blume noted that any decision on building a manufacturing plant in the United States would depend on whether Washington offers substantial financial support.Blume, who will step down as Porsche CEO in January to concentrate fully on running Volkswagen Group, said his recent contract extension as Volkswagen chief executive until 2030 signalled continued backing from the Porsche and Piëch families as well as the German state of Lower Saxony, the company’s largest shareholders.“But it is true, of course, that shareholders have suffered losses since Porsche went public three years ago. I, too, must face up to this criticism,” he said.",Volkswagen Group plans to invest €160 billion ($186 billion) through 2030.

Key takeaways -China Shock 2.0

The bottom line





In the early 2000s, American factory towns began to empty out. In North Carolina, furniture makers who had worked three generations watched their mills close. Across the industrial centres– from Jakarta to Ohio, a quiet devastation spread—not from war or natural disaster, but from an economic force few had anticipated.In the spring of 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization, few anticipated the seismic transformation that would follow. Over the next decade, a torrent of Chinese exports swept through global markets with such force that economists gave it a name:By the time the dust settled, an estimated 2.0 to 2.4 million American manufacturing jobs had vanished, wages in affected communities remained depressed for a full decade, and the political landscape of the industrialized world had been permanently altered.Now, twenty-four years later, the tremors have returned—but this time, they emanate not from factories churning out toys and textiles, but from gleaming facilities producing electric vehicles , lithium-ion batteries, solar panels, and semiconductors.Welcome to China Shock 2.0: a techno-industrial upheaval that threatens to be both broader in scope and deeper in consequence than its predecessor.To understand the magnitude of what's emerging, we must first distinguish between the two shocks clearly.The foundational research on the first China Shock comes from economists David Autor of MIT, David Dorn of the University of Zurich, and Gordon Hanson of Harvard. Their landmark 2013 paper in thedocumented how rising Chinese imports between 1990 and 2007 devastated local labor markets across the United States. The findings challenged orthodox economic thinking that assumed workers displaced by trade would smoothly transition to new jobs and industries.The researchers found that import competition explained approximately one-quarter of the aggregate decline in US manufacturing employment during this period. More troubling still, their follow-up work demonstrated that adjustment in affected communities was ""remarkably slow""—wages, labor-force participation rates, and unemployment remained depressed for at least a full decade after the shock commenced.Now, Autor warns of something far more serious. ""The US is in danger of losing the next great manufacturing battle, this time over advanced technologies to make cars and planes as well as those enabling AI, quantum computing, and fusion energy"", he told MIT Technology Review in July.The second is powered by technological leadership, industrial policy of unprecedented scope, and dominance across entire value chains. According to the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), China is now ""the world's sole manufacturing superpower""—a status reflected in hard data that would have seemed fantastical two decades ago.In 2024, China accounted for approximately 27.7% of global manufacturing output by value, producing $4.66 trillion worth of manufactured goods according to World Bank data compiled through the United Nations Statistics Division.By volume metrics, China's share rises even higher—some estimates place it at 35% of global gross manufacturing production, more than the combined output of the United States, Japan, Germany, and India.China's dominance in strategic sectors:""China has this immense manufacturing capacity, and the goods have to go somewhere"" Gordon Hanson, now a professor at Harvard Kennedy School, said earlier this year.The competition between Washington and Beijing has fundamentally shifted terrain. Where once the contest centered on textile quotas and steel dumping, today it revolves around semiconductor fabrication, artificial intelligence computing power, and electric vehicle supply chains.China leads in 57 of 64 critical technologies tracked by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, compared to leading in only three technologies two decades ago. These aren't peripheral capabilities—they include advanced aircraft engines, quantum computing, high-performance computing, and military-linked technologies like autonomous systems and radar with focus on innovation.The asymmetry in government support is staggering. China spends an estimated $450-500 billion annually on industrial subsidies—a figure confirmed by research from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and Rhodium Group.By contrast, the US CHIPS Act allocates $52 billion over five years. The European Union's Chips Act commits €43 billion. India's Production Linked Incentive schemes total $26 billion. Japan and South Korea have announced roughly $50 billion combined in semiconductor and battery support.Together, these efforts amount to approximately $100 billion per year—one-fifth of China's commitment.The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission's 2025 annual report says ""China Shock 2.0 also threatens to complicate de-risking efforts, as China’s market share gained from export dominance can be quickly turned into leverage over the supply chain.""The report notes that China has begun producing higher-value-added goods at scale, the result of years of technology acquisition, massive government subsidies, and aggressive industrial policies.Yet Goldman Sachs Research remains bullish on China's trajectory. The investment bank raised its real GDP forecast for 2026 from 4.3% to 4.8% and for 2027 from 4.0% to 4.7%, citing the government's determination to advance manufacturing competitiveness and boost exports.""The approval of the new Five-Year Plan proposal highlights the government's determination and capability to keep advancing its manufacturing and boost its export market share"", Goldman Sachs noted in its November analysis.Hui Shan, Goldman Sachs' chief China economist, explained the resilience: ""Chinese exports of chips, semiconductors, autos, auto parts—they are growing steadily despite the fact that the US has imposed tariffs"".In 2024, China recorded the largest global trade surplus in economic history: $992 billion, according to official customs data. This figure beat the previous record of $838 billion set in 2022 and approached the symbolically potent $1 trillion mark.The IMF has documented how China's trade surplus rose substantially following the pandemic, driven by weak domestic demand from a property market downturn and elevated household savings rates. According to a September 2024 IMF analysis, China's trade balance stood between 2% and 4% of GDP. IMF data shows China's export volumes rose approximately 40% between 2019 and 2024, while import volumes increased by only 1%.A central point of contention in the China Shock 2.0 debate concerns the role of state subsidies. Multiple organizations have attempted to quantify the scale of Chinese industrial policy support, with estimates varying significantly.The OECD's Manufacturing Groups and Industrial Corporations (MAGIC) database found that Chinese firms receive ""four to eight times"" the subsidy rates of other firms. A recent IMF working paper estimated that the equivalent fiscal cost of Chinese industrial policy is approximately 4% of GDP per year.For India, the moment represents both peril and extraordinary opportunity.With 67 million manufacturing workers, a growing working-age population, and democratic governance, India could emerge as the critical counterweight to Chinese manufacturing dominance.“India must push manufacturing to grow employment and develop a stronger economy,” Kant said."" said Former Niti aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, India's G20 Sherpa. In September 2025.David Autor emphasized the stakes in his July interview: ""When we think about advanced manufacturing and why it's important, it's not so much about the number of jobs anymore. It's about economic leadership. It's about innovation. It's about political leadership, and even standard setting for how the rest of the world works"".The government's Production Linked Incentive schemes have shown promise. Electronics manufacturing has grown rapidly, with exports reaching $42 billion in 2024. But the scale remains insufficient.Yet India possesses unique advantages. Its demographic dividend is just beginning–the working-age population will continue growing even as China shrinks. The country has demonstrated capabilities in pharmaceuticals, IT services, and automotive manufacturing. Democratic governance provides political stability that reassures Western partners seeking to diversify supply chains.The fundamental question is not whether China Shock 2.0 occurs– but whether countries can coordinate an effective response at sufficient scale before Chinese dominance becomes irreversible.The clock is ticking.As the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission's 2025 Report makes clear:“In many ways, China Shock 2.0 is enabled by the limitations of that system—many countries are constrained in how they can respond to the deluge of China’s excess production despite the growing threat of damage to their labor markets and home industries.”The fundamental question facing policymakers in Washington, Brussels, Tokyo, Seoul, and New Delhi is not whether China Shock 2.0 is coming, but the only question is whether we are ready this time.For millions of workers in automotive plants, battery factories, solar installations, and electronics assembly, the answer will determine not just abstract national competitiveness, but the concrete reality of whether their jobs, communities, and livelihoods can survive the second great wave from the East.","China Shock 2.0 may result in Chinese producers taking over market share in countries all over the world. In 2024, China accounted for approximately 27.7% of global manufacturing output by value, producing $4.66 trillion worth of manufactured goods. China spends an estimated $450-500 billion annually on industrial subsidies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125804046,imgsize-1041316,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

The Commerce Department said on Friday that prices rose 0.3% in September from August, matching the previous month’s increase, in a report delayed five weeks by the government shutdown.Core prices — excluding food and energy — rose 0.2%, also the same as August. On an annual basis, overall prices increased 2.8%, slightly above 2.7% in August, while core inflation eased marginally to 2.8% from 2.9%, According to AP report.Economists said the data point to muted core inflation and bolster the case for a rate cut, even though headline inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target. They noted that President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to put upward pressure on prices, though Fed officials argue that slow hiring, modest economic growth and subdued wage gains are likely to cool inflation in coming months.Omair Sharif, chief economist at Inflation Insights, said Friday’s report would likely reassure policymakers that core inflation remains contained.But he flagged one area of concern: a measure of services inflation that remains stubbornly high.“It hasn’t really shown any sign of slowing down,” Sharif said. “That has to be concerning for them.”The Fed faces a difficult policy choice next week. Under typical conditions, it would keep rates elevated to curb inflation. But with hiring weakening and unemployment slowly rising, it hopes that cutting rates will spur borrowing and support the economy.Consumer spending, meanwhile, rose 0.3% in September, down from 0.5% in August, signalling softer household demand. Spending appeared to strengthen over Black Friday and the following weekend; Adobe Analytics reported a 7.7% rise in online spending during the five-day holiday period.Household incomes increased 0.4% in September, the second consecutive month of solid growth.The broader economy continues to send mixed signals. Growth remains steady, but the unemployment rate has edged up to a four-year high of 4.4%. The housing market is stagnant and factories have been cutting jobs, yet heavy investment in artificial intelligence data centres has provided support.On Wednesday, payroll processor ADP said businesses shed 32,000 jobs in November, an indication that job markets may be weakening further.

"Trust fund babies – but there's a twist! What are ‘Trump Accounts’? Here's how to claim your $1,000",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trust-fund-babies-but-theres-a-twist-what-are-trump-accounts-heres-how-to-claim-your-1000/articleshow/125778800.cms,"So, what exactly is the Trump Account?



Who qualifies for the $1,000?



They must be US citizens and have a Social Security number. The programme is limited only to the babies born during Trump administration, i.e., born between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2028. A parent can open the account regardless of their own immigration status.

Nothing for older children?



Enrolling for Trump Accounts



Why supporters say the programme matters



Concerns from critics



The journey into adulthood has looked different for everyone, depending on the family they are born into. In affluent homes, young people often leave with a trust fund to soften the landing, while for the less privileged, turning 18 can mean stepping into financial responsibility almost overnight. This, however, might change with the less famous provision of US President Donald Trump's tax legislation, which aims to give $1,000 to every new born.Say hello to the Trump Account that promises to help narrow that divide by ensuring every child enters adulthood with something to build on.Inside this provision, every newborn gets $1,000, provided their parents open an investment account under the new programme. The bill, which became law earlier this year, allows private firms to invest the funds in the stock market, and the child gains access only when they turn 18. Parents of older children can also participate by opening an account, although those children won’t receive the $1,000 incentive.However, a significant boost arrived earlier this week when philanthropists Michael and Susan Dell pledged funding that will allow some children aged 10 and below to receive $250 if their parents open an account.The Dell donation applies to children living in ZIP codes where the median family income is $150,000 or less, and who would not otherwise qualify for the Treasury-funded $1,000.A Trump Account functions as a long-term savings vehicle tied directly to the stock market. Money is held until the child turns 18 and can only be used for specific milestones, including paying for higher education, starting a business or making a down payment on a house.When an account is created for an eligible newborn, the US Treasury contributes $1,000. Private banks and brokerages manage the investments, and the rules require that funds be placed in US equity index funds with annual fees capped at 0.10%.Parents may also add up to the funds, contributing up to $2,500 per year in pretax income, much like a retirement account. Employers, friends, relatives, local governments and charitable groups can also contribute. There is a $5,000 yearly contribution cap, not considering government and charitable donations.The $1,000 seed deposit is available to babies who tick all these boxes:Though children born before 2025 will not receive the $1,000 Treasury incentive, an account can still be opened for any child younger than 18.These accounts allow up to $2,500 per year in pretax contributions from parents. Some may also qualify for the Dells’ $250 donation if they are aged 10 or under and live in eligible ZIP codes.While contributions cannot be made until July 2026, families can begin the enrolment process by submitting Form 4547 to the Internal Revenue Service.Parents who sign up early will receive instructions in May to complete the setup process. The White House says an online portal for account registration will go live in July.Another thing to keep in mind is that the money cannot be used before the child turns 18 except in exceptional cases, and withdrawals will be taxed, meaning the programme is not designed to assist with immediate household needs.Those backing the idea argue that the initiative expands access to stock market investing and offers even children born into poverty the opportunity to gain from long-term financial growth. They say that providing every newborn with $1,000 could counter the rising appeal of socialism by giving more Americans a direct path to wealth creation. The US Securities and Exchange Commission reports that 58% of American households owned stocks or bonds in 2022, but the richest 1% held almost half of the total value.Before Trump Accounts, there were ""baby bonds,"" introduced by states like California, Connecticut and the district of Columbia, that targeted children raised in poverty, foster care or those who lost a parent to COVID-19. Several other states, including Maryland, are weighing similar schemes.However, unlike Trump Accounts, those state-led programmes exclude wealthier children and are funded and managed by governments instead of private investment firms.Opponents argue that the programme offers no support to children during their early years, the stage when families are most financially vulnerable. They also note that the accounts do not compensate for cuts made elsewhere. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans reduced funding for programmes including Medicaid and food assistance in the same tax bill that introduced the accounts.They further warned that the policy could deepen economic inequality. Families capable of making the maximum yearly pretax contribution will see the greatest financial gains, whereas those unable to save will benefit the least. Using a projected annual return of 7%, the $1,000 Treasury contribution would grow to roughly $3,570 by the time a child reaches 18.","The Trump Account is a provision of US President Donald Trump's tax legislation. Every newborn born between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2028 gets $1,000, provided their parents open an investment account.

Netflix was born out of the resentments of the video cassette age. Anyone who lived through the 1990s remembers the ritual: rushing to the local rental store on a Friday evening, discovering the last VHS copy was already gone and then returning the tape late on Monday morning, only to be punished with a fee that cost more than the film. Netflix emerged as a small Californian rebellion against this experience. Instead of fluorescent aisles and impatient clerks, it offered DVDs in red envelopes mailed directly to your home. Instead of rewinding tapes, you simply logged into a website and waited for the postman to arrive. It was a simple idea designed for people who wanted to escape the tyranny of Blockbuster.Two and a half decades later, that humble mail-order start-up is preparing to buy the studio that helped build modern Hollywood itself. Netflix’s planned acquisition of Warner Bros – the century-old home of Casablanca, Harry Potter, DC superheroes, The Lord of the Rings (via New Line), HBO and control of classics like The Wizard of Oz – for an enterprise value of roughly 82.7 billion dollars marks a transformative moment in entertainment history. For the first time, a company that began its life shipping DVDs is about to take ownership of a film and television library that has shaped global culture for a hundred years.This is not just a corporate transaction. It is the moment streaming becomes the centre of the entertainment universe.Netflix’s early success came from identifying a simple human truth: people hated late fees. The company replaced penalties with subscriptions and replaced return dates with unlimited rentals. But the real leap arrived in 2007, when Netflix began streaming films directly over the internet. At the time, internet video was grainy, unreliable and better suited for cat clips than cinema. Yet Netflix bet that broadband infrastructure would catch up.That bet proved correct. Streaming transformed Netflix from a quirky DVD service into the largest entertainment platform on the planet. The company expanded around the world, built an unmatched recommendation system and eventually began producing its own shows. House of Cards and Orange Is the New New Black showed that Netflix could make premium television. Stranger Things, Money Heist, Squid Game and Bridgerton made it a cultural force.Yet Netflix still faced one structural weakness. It had hits, but it did not have heritage. Unlike Disney or Warner Bros, it did not own a deep catalogue of films and shows that could be reimagined for generations, sold across formats or spun into franchises. Its library was powerful but relatively young. For a subscription business, long-lasting intellectual property becomes the anchor that holds audiences in place.If Netflix represents the story of technological disruption, Warner Bros represents the foundation of Hollywood itself. Founded in 1923, the studio introduced sound to cinema with The Jazz Singer. It gave the world Casablanca, defined the golden age of musicals with titles it now controls such as The Wizard of Oz, shaped modern rebellion with Rebel Without a Cause, reinvented horror with The Exorcist and expanded the boundaries of action cinema with The Matrix. Its New Line division shepherded The Lord of the Rings trilogy to global acclaim.Its television arm is equally influential. HBO transformed scripted entertainment by proving that cinematic storytelling could thrive on the small screen. The Sopranos, The Wire, Game of Thrones and Succession reshaped what television could be. Meanwhile, Warner’s mainstream sitcoms – Friends, The Big Bang Theory, ER and dozens more – became the comfort food of global syndication.But Warner Bros also endured repeated mergers, debt burdens and strategic upheavals. As cable television declined, the economics that once funded HBO came under strain. HBO Max, though expanding into new regions and still growing, lagged Netflix in global scale. The company found itself navigating the impossible balance between legacy networks, theatrical releases and streaming ambitions.This is the legacy Netflix is buying.But Netflix’s expansion is not being greeted with universal enthusiasm. A group of prominent filmmakers has already sent an anonymous letter to members of the US Congress warning that the acquisition could “hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace,” arguing that a Netflix-controlled Warner Bros would have the power to shrink theatrical release windows and destabilise the ecosystem that sustains thousands of industry jobs. Their note, referenced in the Variety report, describes fears that Netflix’s dominance as both a buyer and distributor could give it unprecedented leverage over exhibition chains, post-theatrical licensing and the financial health of feature filmmaking itself. The appeal urges lawmakers to subject the deal to the highest level of antitrust scrutiny, framing the merger not merely as a business story but a cultural and institutional inflection point for Hollywood.The financials make clear how monumental this transaction is. Netflix will acquire the Warner Bros studio, HBO, HBO Max and the entire film and television catalogue for an enterprise value of roughly 82.7 billion dollars and equity value of around 72 billion dollars. Shareholders will receive a mix of cash and Netflix stock valued at about 27.75 dollars per share. Netflix expects annual cost savings of two to three billion dollars by year three and forecasts that the deal will increase earnings per share by year two.Before the acquisition closes, Warner Bros Discovery will spin off its linear networks – CNN, Discovery, TLC and various factual and lifestyle channels – into a separate company. Netflix is purchasing the creative and streaming heart of the Warner empire, not the legacy cable infrastructure.This deal rivals Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox in scale and easily surpasses most modern entertainment mergers. Yet the dynamic is entirely different: a digital-born platform is absorbing a traditional studio, not the other way around.The acquisition solves three long-standing problems for Netflix in one move.The first is the library gap. By acquiring Warner’s vault, Netflix finally gains a catalogue with true generational weight. DC superheroes, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, The Matrix, Looney Tunes, HBO’s golden-age dramas and thousands of films and TV episodes become permanent Netflix assets. These are not simply shows and movies; they are narrative worlds that can be extended, rebooted and monetised for decades.The second change is theatrical power. Warner Bros owns soundstages, production facilities and distribution relationships that span the globe. Netflix’s relationship with cinemas has always been experimental and occasionally uneasy. By inheriting Warner’s infrastructure and release commitments, Netflix gains the credibility and machinery of a long-standing theatrical studio. It no longer needs to choose between being a streaming platform or a film studio. It becomes both.The third transformation concerns control. Netflix no longer depends on external studios for high-value franchises. It controls windows, renewals, merchandising and long-term franchise strategy. It can blend its vast viewer data with Warner’s storytelling and production expertise to decide which universes to expand and how to release them.In effect, Netflix stops being primarily a distributor and becomes a full-spectrum entertainment conglomerate.For years, Disney has been the only company with true franchise supremacy. Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar and Disney Animation feed into a global ecosystem of films, streaming, merchandise, parks and cruises. It has been the only studio able to dominate theatre schedules and streaming algorithms simultaneously.Netflix acquiring Warner Bros challenges that supremacy for the first time in a meaningful way. Disney and Netflix will now sit on comparable piles of narrative universes. Where Disney has Marvel, Netflix will have DC. Where Disney has Star Wars, Netflix will hold the worlds of Game of Thrones and Harry Potter. Where Disney has a robust theatrical pipeline, Netflix will now have one too.Disney remains a powerhouse, but it now competes with an entity that has both greater digital reach and an equally recognisable roster of franchises. Its task becomes maintaining cultural momentum in an environment where Netflix’s catalogue will suddenly look far deeper and far more emotionally familiar to audiences across the world.For smaller studios, the landscape becomes far more challenging. Paramount, which had aggressively pursued Warner as a way to bulk up, now finds itself exposed. Its franchises – Mission: Impossible, Top Gun, Star Trek, Nickelodeon – are valuable but not enough to compete with the consolidated libraries of Netflix–Warner or Disney. A merger or sale appears increasingly likely simply to remain viable.NBCUniversal’s Peacock also misses the chance to absorb HBO content. Sony, lacking a major streaming platform of its own, must choose whether to remain a licensing powerhouse or seek deeper alliances. In an environment dominated by scale, mid-sized players face enormous pressure either to specialise or to consolidate.From an analytical standpoint, the streaming landscape is now evolving into a three-pole system: Netflix–Warner, Disney and Amazon–MGM. Other services may continue to exist, but most will orbit these core ecosystems rather than challenge them directly.For a decade, streaming was framed as the insurgent force attacking Hollywood’s old order. Netflix was the outsider; studios were the establishment. Cable bundles, release windows and theatrical exclusivity were the system Netflix sought to disrupt.This deal erases that divide completely. When the world’s largest streaming service acquires a studio that defined Hollywood’s golden age, the categories collapse. Streaming is no longer the challenger; streaming becomes the industry’s organising principle. Theatrical releases become one element of a multi-platform strategy anchored in global subscriptions and long-term intellectual property.Hollywood’s centre shifts from geography to architecture: whoever controls the universes – and the pipeline that delivers them – controls the culture.For audiences, the benefits will appear slowly but unmistakably. More iconic films and series will live under a single subscription. HBO’s prestige slate, Warner’s classics, DC’s superheroes, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and Netflix originals will eventually coexist on one platform. Convenience will increase, even as questions about pricing and competition intensify.For creators, the merger brings both opportunity and uncertainty. Netflix–Warner will become the world’s most powerful buyer of scripted content, capable of financing ambitious projects at scale. Yet consolidation also means fewer independent bidders for talent and a need to reconcile HBO’s creator-driven culture with Netflix’s data-driven commissioning.And for Hollywood, this is a turning point. A company built to eliminate late fees will now own the archives that define a century of storytelling. Technological disruption has merged with cinematic legacy, and the result is an entertainment ecosystem unlike anything the industry has seen.Netflix was once the outsider. With this acquisition, it becomes the custodian of one of the most important film and television libraries ever assembled. The future of entertainment will no longer be determined by who makes the most compelling story, but by who controls the universes that audiences return to year after year.Netflix wanted to escape the tyranny of the video store. It now finds itself in charge of Hollywood’s memory – and its future.","Netflix's planned acquisition of Warner Bros marks a transformative moment in entertainment history. Netflix’s early success came from identifying a simple human truth: people hated late fees. Warner Bros is the century-old home of Casablanca, Harry Potter, DC superheroes, The Lord of the Rings (via New Line), HBO.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125790519,imgsize-95534,width-400,resizemode-4/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros.jpg"

The streaming giant is now in exclusive negotiations to purchase Warner Bros Discovery’s film and television studios, as well as its streaming businesses, after putting forward an offer priced at $28 per share, according to a source with direct knowledge of the discussions.Warner Bros Discovery, the owner of HBO, has spent months weighing strategic options. A second round of bids arrived this week following initial proposals from Netflix, Paramount Skydance and Comcast. Reuters previously reported that Netflix submitted a mostly cash offer and ultimately surfaced as the frontrunner.At $28 per share, Netflix’s bid exceeds Warner Bros Discovery’s closing price of $24.54 on Thursday, and also tops a nearly $24 proposal made by Paramount that covered the company’s entire portfolio, including its cable channels such as CNN, TNT and TBS.The move marks another bold shift in Netflix’s strategy as it pushes beyond its core subscription business to tap additional revenue sources. Securing Warner Bros, home to franchises including Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and DC Comics, would place Netflix in control of some of the world’s most valuable entertainment properties and move it towards becoming a vertically integrated powerhouse that produces, distributes and monetises major IP on its own platforms.The company has also been extending its reach into gaming, live content and consumer experiences.Bloomberg News reported that Netflix is willing to pay a breakup fee of $5 billion if regulators block the transaction, and that the two companies could unveil a formal agreement within days, according Reuters.The possibility of the takeover has triggered industry pushback. Variety reported that a consortium of prominent film figures has called on the US Congress to intervene should Netflix’s attempt succeed, warning of a “looming economic and institutional crisis” across Hollywood.Meanwhile, CNBC said on Thursday that Paramount has accused Warner Bros of conducting a sale process that unfairly benefits Netflix over other bidders. The network cited a letter sent by the newly merged media company.""We strongly urge you to empower such a special committee comprised of directors with no potential appearance of bias or beholdenness to others whose interests may differ from those of the stockholders,"" Paramount's legal team wrote in the letter, cited by Reuters.The latest bidding follows a failed attempt earlier this year: in October, Warner Bros declined an estimated $60 billion takeover offer from Paramount for the entire business before launching a more structured sales process for its assets.","Netflix is in exclusive negotiations to purchase Warner Bros Discovery's film and television studios, as well as its streaming businesses.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

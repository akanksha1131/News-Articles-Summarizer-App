SAIL has broken above its downward-sloping trendline resistance after a prolonged consolidation, indicating the start of a fresh bullish phase. A sustained move above ₹145 would validate this breakout and open room for further upside. The price has crossed above short- and medium-term EMAs and is approaching the 200-EMA zone, signaling a potential medium-term trend reversal supported by improving volume and price strength.RSI has turned upward from the 50-zone, while +DI is crossing above –DI with a rising ADX — confirming strengthening momentum. The stock offers a favourable risk–reward setup near ₹140–₹138 with potential for trend continuation toward ₹163.Hindustan Zinc has corrected around 12.5% from its recent peak and found strong support near the 200-DEMA — a crucial long-term average that often defines major trend pivots. The stock has formed a bullish engulfing pattern at this support, indicating a possible reversal in momentum after the recent decline.Additionally, a bullish divergence on the hourly MACD highlights weakening downside momentum and renewed buying interest.Sustaining above the ₹470–₹475 zone could trigger a move toward ₹525, while a close below ₹460 would negate this bullish view.Nippon Life India Asset Management has formed a double bottom pattern near the 50-DEMA, coinciding with support from the Ichimoku cloud — reinforcing a strong base around current levels. This structural confluence, along with a bullish divergence on the hourly MACD, suggests that selling pressure is easing and buyers are regaining control. The setup indicates a likely trend reversal, with potential for an upward move toward ₹965 in the coming sessions. Sustaining above ₹895 will be crucial to confirm the bullish momentum.","According to Mehul Kothari, DVP - Technical Research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, the top stocks to buy today are SAIL, Hindustan Zinc, and Nippon Life India Asset Management.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125263993,imgsize-77164,width-400,resizemode-4/top-stocks-to-buy.jpg"

Gold price prediction: Why are gold prices rallying again and what's the outlook? Top levels investors should watch out for,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-rates-headed-on-november-11-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-silver-prices/articleshow/125239089.cms,"In the very short-term, gold is expected to test the strong resistance around $4160. (AI image)

Gold price prediction:

Gold Performance:

Although expectations of the ongoing US shutdown ending soon boosted risk appetite, spot gold extended its Friday's rally to surge sharply higher on Monday on the Fed rate cut expectations, wobbly US Dollar and China's Central Bank adding gold reserves for 12th month in a row in October.

Gold gained on inflation concerns also as President Donald Trump once again floated the idea of sending Americans rebate checks of at least $2000 a person (excluding high income people) for the tariffs that his administration has collected.

At the time of writing this article, spot gold was trading with a huge daily gain of 2.34% at $4,096, while MCX Gold December contract at Rs 123,707 was up 2.07%.

December contract at Rs 123,707 was up 2.07%. In the week ending November 7, spot gold prices posted a weekly loss of $1 to close at $4001, which amounts to a third straight weekly loss per se.

US Shutdown likely to end:

On November 9, the US Senate advanced a plan to end the longest-ever US government shutdown that entered the week. A faction of moderate democrats defied their party leaders and voted to support a deal to end the ongoing shutdown.

As flight disruptions have worsened due heavy snow, the ongoing shutdown may intensify the stress on the US air-traffic system ahead of the busy Thanksgiving travel period as controllers may have to continue to work without pay checks.

Fedspeak:

Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis President Musalem expects the US economy to bounce back strongly early next year due to rate cuts, fiscal support, deregulation and the government shutdown ending. He urged the Fed officials to be cautious on additional rate cuts as he thinks that the current Fed policy is close to the level where it would not put any downward pressure on inflation.

On the contrary, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly warned against keeping interest rates too high for too long due to softening labour market and moderating wage growth.

US Dollar Index and yields:

At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index at 99.72 was up around 0.15% for the day. Day’s low has been 99.45.

Ten-year US yields at 4.11% were up by around 1.50 bps, while 2-year yields at 3.59% were up by around 3 bps.

US Data roundup:

US employment report has not been published in November, which makes it the second month without a national employment report.

Bloomberg estimates that depending on the US government reopening date, September employment report may be published on November 19/November 26. Even then the report may not offer true picture due to uncertainty over Federal government employment figures. Other reports will also be delayed.

October CPI report may not be released though.

Data released in the week ending November 7 were largely mixed as US ISM manufacturing trailed the forecast and contracted for the seventh straight month in October, while ISM services at 52.40 beat the forecast of 50.80 to rise at the fastest pace since February.

University of Michigan Consumer sentiment fell from 53.60 in October to 50.30 in November, near record-low and even lower than 2008 global financial crisis and Covid levels.

It is to be noted that ADP data released last week showed that US companies added 42K jobs in October, which signalled a moderate stabilization in the US job market. Challenger job cuts report showed almost 950,000 US job cuts this year through September, the highest year-to-date total since 2020.

Gold ETFs and COMEX inventory:

Total known global gold ETF holdings rose for two straight days through November 7 to 97.24 MOz, though were down for the third consecutive weeks. Nonetheless, holdings are up 17.36% this year and are hovering around 3-year high level.

China's domestic gold ETF holdings rose by 79.015 tons in January to September period, which is a steep rise compared to the 29.927 tons-gain during the same period last year.

COMEX gold eligible inventory at 17.94Moz is around the lowest level since April.

China's Central Bank buys gold for the 12th month in a row:

China's official gold reserves stood at 74.09 MOz at the end of October, up from 74.06 MOz a month earlier, which means that PBoC bought nearly one ton of gold in October.

Uzbekistan's gold reserves reached $47.85 billion October, a record high for the fourth straight month.

China's gold consumption dips:

According to a statement from the China Gold Association, the nation's gold consumption dropped 7.95% y-o-y to 682.73 tons in the January-September period.

Gold Price Outlook:

A possible end to the US government shutdown has turned investors' attention back to the Fed rate expectations in October as the upcoming US data may show deteriorating economy.

Gold is benefiting due to China extending its buying spree and inflation concerns, too.

However, steady US yields and Dollar may limit the gains barring

In the very short-term, gold is expected to test the strong resistance around $4160, a successful breach of which would open the way to test the resistance in $4190-$4200 zone.

Dip buying is preferred over chasing the rally.

Support is at $4075/$4025/$3990.

Silver: Sharply up

MCX Silver December contract surged to 153,650, up 4% for the day.

The metal may test the resistance around Rs 158,500 as it has taken out the strong resistance at $49.30 (Rs 150,000), which will act as a support now.

Next support comes in at $48.50 (Rs 148,000).

Dip buying is preferred over chasing the current rally.

Gold prices are rallying again on the hopes of US Federal Reserve rate cut expectations, and China’s gold buying. However, Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan recommends buying the dip, rather than chasing the rally. The analyst shares his views on gold price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:","Spot gold was trading with a huge daily gain of 2.34% at $4,096, while MCX Gold December contract at Rs 123,707 was up 2.07%.

US government shutdown: Supreme Court extends block on Snap payments; hopes rise for potential end to standoff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-govt-shutdown-supreme-court-extends-block-on-snap-payments-hopes-rise-for-potential-end-to-standoff/articleshow/125263032.cms,"1000+ Flights Cancelled As Shutdown Severely Impacts American Aviation Sector

Snap benefits









The US Supreme Court had, once again, refused to order the Trump administration to provide full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). Instead it has chosen to allow congress additional time to resolve the matter through a possible agreement tied to ending the government shutdown.In an order issued on Tuesday (local time), the justices extended a temporary halt on a lower court ruling that had required the administration to release full food benefit payments. The stay remains active until November 13, effectively putting the funding issue on hold without the court examining the legal arguments of either side.The dispute reached the Supreme Court after Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who handles emergency requests from the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals’ jurisdiction, paused a district court-imposed deadline for the payments while the appeals judges reviewed the case.Jackson, one of the court’s liberal justices, approved an emergency request from the administration, even though the matter involves a programme strongly supported by Democrats. In the latest order, Jackson stated she disagreed with the court’s decision to keep the pause in place on full Snap funding.Meanwhile, lawmakers are racing to reach a broader deal. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on Wednesday on a plan to reopen the government through January 30.That proposal includes full-year funding for several federal agencies and services, covering food assistance and benefits for veterans.The department of justice has warned the Supreme Court that judicial intervention risks complicating shutdown negotiations.Government lawyers, according to USA Today, have argued that the lower courts introduced a “massively inappropriate new variable” and disrupted the operation of Snap. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote, ""Congress appears to be on the brink of breaking the deadlock, though that outcome is unsure.”“The district court’s unlawful orders risk upsetting that compromise and throwing into doubt how innumerable critical federal programs will be funded,"" Sauer was further quoted by the agency.The legal fight began when the US district judge John McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the administration to use contingency Snap funds and other available money to ensure full November payments reached states by November 7. The appeals court sided with McConnell, ruling that the danger of leaving tens of millions of Americans without adequate food support outweighed the administration’s objections to using alternative funds.The groups opposing the Trump administration have argued that Snap recipients had “now gone ten days without the help they need to afford food,” warning that millions of Americans, including children, were already going hungry.Almost 42 million people across the country rely on food stamps, which are distributed in phases throughout the month. According to Code for America, an organisation that helps governments improve access to public benefit programmes, about 27 million of them should have received their payments by Monday.US households, according to CNN, on an average get roughly $350 a month to purchase food, but for many families, that money runs out quickly.","The US Supreme Court extended a temporary halt on a lower court ruling that had required the administration to release full food benefit payments.

Gold Price Outlook

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price ended last week almost flat showing consolidated moves while positive developments over US Shutdown reopening over the weekend revived prospects for rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in December shifting focus back to deteriorating US Fiscal outlook. US private jobs data released last week indicated a weak labour market, further supporting the US rate cut prospects. US Challenger job data also indicated a spike in job cuts, suggesting a possible cooling in US labour market conditions.CME Fed funds tool showed rate cut possibility for December 10 -11 meeting have risen to above 90 % now from around 66 % yesterday. Worries about the potential economic fallout from the longest-ever US government shutdown turned out to be a key factor that continued to underpin demand for the safe-haven commodity as the yellow metal rose to three week highs in the current week.Inflation concerns also persisted as President Donald Trump floated the idea of sending American rebate checks of at least $ 2000 a person (excluding high income people) for the tariffs that his administration has collected which provided additional support to yellow metal.In other news, China central bank continued to buy gold for 12th Consecutive month as data showed China's official gold reserves stood at 74.09 MOz at the end of October up 74.06 Moz from a month earlier, which meant PBoC bought nearly one tonne which continued to boost sentiments in Gold.Meanwhile spot silver rose more than 4 % to above $50 per oz, reaching its highest since October 21. The US, which added copper, and silver to its critical minerals list, also provided structural support for precious and industrial metals. However, the supply shortage which persisted in October has likely eased now indicating an unlikely scenario for new highs in spot, but prices could still find support from uncertain economic conditions in the US which could keep safe haven flows intact in white metal.In the near term, gold is expected to test its resistance zone around $ 4190 – 4210 per oz (CMP $ 4135/Oz) while buying on dips could remain a favourable strategy for the metal. Support for the yellow metal could persist in the range of $ 4110 – 4075 per oz in near term. On MCX futures (CMP 124,850/10 gm) prices are expected to witness strong supports in the range of 1,23,800 – 1,22,900 per 10 gm levels in near term as resistance on higher side to remain at around Rs, 1,26,500 – 1,27,900 /10 gm levels for the week.Looking ahead for the week, volatility in prices could also occur at higher levels driven by fluctuations in the dollar index and global financial market as traders could closely monitor the US October Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data later on Thursday. The headline CPI is expected to show an increase of 0.2% MoM in October, while the core CPI is projected to show a rise of 0.3% MoM during the same period. The US Retail Sales will be in the spotlight on Friday.Silver could also trade with a positive bias as a rise towards $ 52. 20 - 52.50 per oz (CMP $ 51.10/Oz) in spot cannot be ruled out in near term. Strong support could persist in the range of $ 50.20 – 49.50 /Oz levels. On MCX futures contract (CMP Rs. 1,55,500/Kg.) This could translate to a support level of Rs. 1,52,500–1,50,800 / Kg & resistance at Rs 1,58,000 - 1,59,500/Kg levels for the week.","Gold prices are expected to face upside resistance, and buying on dips may be a favourable strategy, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

Asian equities edged higher on Wednesday following signs that the US government shutdown could end soon and amid data pointing to a cooling jobs market, which has raised expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.Markets, however, remain cautious on technology stocks after a year of strong AI-driven gains.In early Asian trade, major indices rose, with Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 up 0.2% at 50,927, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbing 1.1% to 26,984, and Shanghai’s Composite adding 0.3% to 4,015, as per news agency AFP.Despite the overall positive trend, technology stocks faced pressure after Japanese investor SoftBank sold its entire stake in US chipmaker Nvidia for $5.8 billion, leading to a 3% drop in Nvidia shares and a 10% fall in SoftBank’s Tokyo listing.After the Senate approved a temporary spending bill, the US House of Representatives is set to vote, with President Donald Trump expected to sign the legislation, potentially reopening government services as early as Friday.The shutdown, which began on October 1, left a million federal workers unpaid and delayed key economic data, complicating the Fed’s policy decisions.Private payroll data from ADP showed US companies shed an average of 11,250 jobs per week in the four weeks ending October 25, highlighting weakness in the labour market and increasing bets on a Fed rate cut in December, reported Bloomberg.Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas also reported that October saw the highest level of layoffs in 22 years.Oil prices were largely steady, following gains in the previous session, as traders weighed potential demand increases from a reopening of the US government.Brent crude slipped 8 cents to $65.08 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate fell 7 cents to $60.97, reported Reuters.Analysts noted that restoring government operations could boost consumer confidence, travel, and jet fuel demand ahead of the holiday season.On the supply side, US sanctions on Russian oil producers, including Lukoil and Rosneft, continue to influence global markets, prompting some Chinese refiners to seek non-Russian crude and schedule maintenance disruptions, according to Reuters.Currency and bond markets reflected cautious optimism. The euro dipped to $1.1579, the pound fell to $1.3143, and the dollar strengthened against the yen to 154.37, while US 10-year Treasury yields fell to 4.08% on expectations of looser monetary policy, as per Bloomberg.Asian investors are now monitoring the House vote in Washington closely, with a potential government reopening seen as a key catalyst for equities and crude demand in the near term.","Tokyo's Nikkei 225 up 0.2% at 50,927, Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbs 1.1% to 26,984, and Shanghai's Composite adds 0.3% to 4,015.

NEW DELHI: Smartphone sales in India hit a five-year high in the third quarter of 2025, riding on iPhone surge and festive boost.While Chinese giants Vivo and Oppo led overall volumes with their mainstream smartphones, the sale of iPhones was the toast of the industry as Apple hit a record 5-million units for the first time while also fuelling a strong trajectory in the average selling price (ASP), according to data released by IDC.The demand for mass budget (between Rs 9,000 and Rs 18,000) and entry-premium Android smartphones (Rs 18,000-36,000), however, remained weak over affordability concerns.As per IDC’s worldwide quarterly mobile phone tracker data, the smartphone market grew 4.3% to 48 million units YoY in Q3, 2025. “The growth was driven by strong demand for premium smartphones, supported by both new launches and previous-generation models. ” IDC cautioned that with the mass market category continuing to be under pressure, there has been a significant inventory build-up heading into Q4, which will result in slowdown. “This surplus has been further exacerbated by rising component costs—particularly in memory—and currency fluctuations, prompting brands to raise prices postDiwali,” Upasana Joshi, senior research manager, said.Coming to Q3, it said that Apple, which has been investing to boost production as well as domestic share, continues to see India as one of the bright spots worldwide, something also pointed out by global CEO Tim Cook in quarterly results.The brand, which had previously surpassed erstwhile giant Xiaomi in market share, has now edged past another Chinese player realme to emerge as the fourth-largest brand, behind Vivo, Oppo and Samsung.“Apple recorded its highest-ever quarterly shipments in India in the third quarter of 2025, reaching 5 million units and securing the fourth position in the market for the first time. The iPhone 16 remained the most-shipped smartphone in India during the quarter, contributing 5% of total market shipments,” IDC said.Motorola is only other brand to have grown its market share faster than Apple, though on a lower base and significantly lower volumes. Motorola finished Q3 with a market share of 8.3% . IDC said growth in festive quarter was driven by a combination of market stimulators, including attractive pricing and deep discounting and flexible payment options.","Smartphone sales in India hit a five-year high in the third quarter of 2025, riding on iPhone surge and festive boost.

MUMBAI: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) is closely examining the shortfall in the settlement of health insurance claims, even as over half of the complaints received under the insurance ombudsman system relate to health policies.At the Bima Lokpal Day event on Tuesday, Irdai chairman Ajay Seth said, “In health insurance, we continue to see gaps. While the number of claims settled is high, the amount settled, especially in full, is sometimes lower than expected. This is an area we are monitoring closely,” he said.The chairman urged insurers to focus on fairness and transparency in claims handling. “Our expectation from insurers is clear — prompt, fair, and transparent claim settlement. Anything less weakens the trust on which our industry is built,” he said. Insurers say that the shortfall is because of healthcare providers not sticking to their commitment to charge rates as agreed with the insurers. Hospitals have been blaming insurers for questioning medical processes in hindsight.Seth noted that general and health insurers together settled 3.3 crore health insurance claims in FY25 and paid Rs 94,247 crore towards settlements.Yet, he said, these numbers must be viewed alongside the growing number of complaints that reflect policyholders’ dissatisfaction with claim outcomes.Data from the Insurance Ombudsman shows that of the 53,230 complaints received in FY24, 54% pertained to the health insurance sector. “Behind every complaint is a person — often someone dealing with illness, loss, or distress,” the chairman said, adding that insurers must aim “not just to resolve complaints, but to prevent them.”He called on the industry to strengthen its internal grievance redressal systems to make them “robust, responsive, and reassuring.” He urged insurers to use feedback from the ombudsman’s office as a guide for improvement.“The internal grievance redressal system of the insurance companies needs to be robust, responsive, and reassuring. I would request all insurance companies to periodically review the efficiency of their grievance redressal mechanism and make necessary changes as and when required,” he said. The chairman also said that Irdai is encouraging insurers to appoint internal ombudsmen to improve accountability and speed of resolution.","Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) is closely examining the shortfall in the settlement of health insurance claims.

Cyber security challenges





The Hague (Netherlands): The industrial automation sector is entering a new age where artificial intelligence (AI) and human expertise converge, said Honeywell Process Solutions CEO Jim Masso.Speaking at the Honeywell Users Group (HUG) 2025 Europe Conference in The Hague on Tuesday where the spotlight has been industrial automation and AI, Masso traced the company’s legacy from the development of the world’s first distributed control system (DCS) five decades ago to the present era of connected digital ecosystems and said: “The original goal of automation, achieving deterministic outcomes, remains unchanged even as AI transforms the landscape. ”Honeywell’s next frontier, Masso noted, lies in digital cognition and closed-loop AI systems capable of “seeing, thinking, acting, and learning.” These technologies, built on the company’s Honeywell Forge platform and its Digital Prime ecosystem, aim to combine deep domain expertise with data-driven intelligence to enhance predictability, safety, and performance in critical operations. “The future of automation is about assets that are more connected, more software-aided, and capable of driving optimal outcomes,” he said.Honeywell’s AI-powered platform , the Experion Cognition system, enables facilities to move toward autonomy while maintaining human oversight.Masso cautioned that cybersecurity challenges are evolving as rapidly as automation itself. He stressed the need for domain-specific security platforms tightly integrated with operational technology (OT) systems to ensure resilience as industrial networks become more connected. “Cybersecurity must advance at the same pace as automation,” he said.While technology headlines often focus on AI and autonomy, Masso emphasized that people remain the most important component of industrial transformation. Drawing from a recent AI roundtable, he noted that projects are 2.5 times more successful when leadership (the CEO) fully supports adoption, but cautioned that the real change happens on the plant floor. “What’s encouraging is that operators themselves are getting excited about new capabilities,” he said, citing a chemical refinery where young operators with just two days of experience were already managing an AI-enabled plant using Honeywell’s Forge-based systems.Marking a major milestone, Masso announced the launch of Honeywell’s Autonomy X, a new initiative designed to accelerate AI adoption and autonomous control systems across industries such as energy, chemicals, mining, and life sciences.(This correspondent is in The Hague at the invitation of Honeywell Process Solutions)","Honeywell CEO Jim Masso spoke at the Honeywell Users Group (HUG) 2025 Europe Conference in The Hague.

The longest federal government shutdown in US history may be nearing its end, but economists say it has already left deep scars on an economy struggling with slow growth, inflation, and uncertainty. With 1.25 million federal workers unpaid since October 1 and thousands of flights canceled, the economic fallout is being felt nationwide — from Washington’s suburbs to America’s busiest airports, AP reported.The Senate late Monday night passed a bipartisan funding package to end the 41-day government shutdown, sending it to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives for approval. Speaker Mike Johnson said the House could vote as soon as Wednesday to clear the bill and send it to President Trump for his signature. However, not all Democrats are pleased with the compromise, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer faces criticism from within his party for conceding without securing a firm deal on Obamacare subsidies.In the meantime, while most lost activity may eventually recover once the government reopens, experts warn that billions in economic output will never be regained. “Short-lived shutdowns are usually invisible in the data, but this one will leave a lasting mark,” said Gregory Daco, Chief Economist at EY, citing the shutdown’s record duration and growing disruptions to travel and welfare services.The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a six-week shutdown will cut US economic growth in the fourth quarter by 1.5 percentage points, reducing output by half from the previous quarter. Even after reopening, about $11 billion in economic activity will be permanently lost, it said.Missed paychecks and weakened sentiment hit households hardRoughly 650,000 federal employees were furloughed, and all told, unpaid wages could reach $16 billion by mid-November, reducing household spending and holiday travel, according to the CBO. Although back pay is expected, the sudden loss of income has forced families to postpone large purchases and delay rent or mortgage payments.The impact is particularly sharp in the Washington, D.C. region, where the unemployment rate already stood at 6% before the shutdown. Federal workers make up 5.5% of Maryland’s workforce, while other states such as New Mexico (2.9%), Oklahoma (2.6%), and Alaska (3.8%) also face ripple effects.Federal contractors, who number as many as 5.2 million nationwide, are not guaranteed back pay, compounding the financial strain. Economist Bernard Yaros of Oxford Economics said, “The federal award spigot has all but turned off at the Department of Defense, NASA, and Homeland Security,” estimating that $800 million in new government contracts were at risk of not being awarded each day.Consumer sentiment has also soured sharply. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index fell to 50.4 in November, its lowest in three years, as pessimism about personal finances and business conditions deepened.Flight cancellations, SNAP delays, and Fed policy falloutThe shutdown’s most visible impact has been on air travel, with airlines canceling over 7,500 flights since Friday amid air traffic controller shortages. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered carriers to cut flight capacity by up to 10% to ease the burden on unpaid staff, a move that analysts say could cost the travel industry $2.6 billion if the standoff continues through mid-November.Tourism Economics estimated that travel spending is down $63 million per day, affecting hotels, restaurants, and local businesses. “The longer this goes on, the fewer trips will be rescheduled,” the firm said.The shutdown has also delayed $8 billion in monthly SNAP food aid for 42 million Americans, disrupting grocery spending and household budgets. Some states have covered shortfalls temporarily, but the White House and Congress remain at odds over full benefit funding.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s ability to assess the economy has been crippled by missing data on inflation, unemployment, and consumer spending. Chair Jerome Powell likened the situation to “driving in the fog,” signalling that the central bank may hold off on a December rate cut due to data gaps.“What do you do if you're driving in the fog? You slow down,” Powell said. “The lack of data could make it difficult to justify another rate cut at this stage.”Even as Congress edges toward a resolution, economists warn that the shutdown’s lasting damage to public confidence, household budgets, and business investment could weigh on recovery well into next year.","1.25 million federal workers unpaid since October 1 and thousands of flights canceled.

Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp has sold its stake in US chipmaker Nvidia for $5.8 billion, signalling a strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence investments, particularly in OpenAI , the company said on Tuesday, AP reported. The tech conglomerate also reported that its profit nearly tripled in the first half of the current fiscal year, driven by strong returns from its Vision Funds.The Tokyo-based firm said the Nvidia shares were sold in October as part of Chairman Masayoshi Son’s broader plan to redirect resources toward next-generation AI ventures. SoftBank’s net profit for the April–September period surged to about 2.5 trillion yen (roughly $13 billion), while sales rose 7.7 per cent year-on-year to 3.7 trillion yen ($24 billion).SoftBank’s earnings tend to fluctuate sharply due to its exposure to multiple high-growth and high-risk ventures. However, its tech-heavy portfolio has seen a rebound in 2025 amid the global AI boom.Earlier this year, Son joined US President Donald Trump, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Oracle’s Larry Ellison in announcing Project Stargate -- a proposed $500 billion mega-initiative to develop AI infrastructure and computing power.SoftBank has already invested tens of billions of dollars in OpenAI and plans to expand AI services in Japan through the collaboration.The sale of its Nvidia stake marks a deliberate reallocation of capital -- locking in gains from Nvidia’s meteoric rise while freeing funds for direct AI ventures.Nvidia recently became the world’s first $5 trillion company, fuelled by soaring demand for AI chips. The company has also announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to build at least 10 gigawatts of new AI data centres to boost computing capacity.While SoftBank no longer holds Nvidia stock, it maintains ties through various portfolio companies that use Nvidia technology in AI and robotics. SoftBank also holds stakes in Arm Holdings and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), both of which have benefited from the AI-driven surge in chip demand.SoftBank’s stock has nearly doubled over the past year, rising 2 per cent in Tokyo trading on Tuesday.

What’s next on the holiday calendar





Veterans Day 2025 will be observed on Tuesday, November 11, across the United States, honouring all who have served in the military --in both wartime and peace. Originally observed as Armistice Day in 1919, one year after the end of World War I, the day was renamed Veterans Day in 1954 to commemorate all American veterans.The federal holiday means most government offices will be closed, including post offices and the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), while some services and businesses will continue to operate, often with modified schedules, according to an ET report.Because Veterans Day is a federal holiday, all non-essential government offices will close, and mail delivery will be suspended. Post offices across the country will remain shut, and USPS Priority Mail will be the only active postal service. Most schools will also be closed, though some private institutions and districts may choose to remain open.Banks and credit unions will largely be closed for the day, though customers can still access ATMs, online banking, and mobile apps for transactions. Stock traders, however, won’t face a pause — US stock markets will remain open, while the US bond market will be closed, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, as reported by USA Today.Retail, restaurants, and delivery servicesMost retail chains and grocery stores, including Walmart, Costco, and Target, will stay open. Many stores and eateries will also offer special discounts or free meals for veterans as part of nationwide appreciation efforts.For delivery services, UPS and FedEx will run modified schedules, ensuring that most parcels still reach customers on time. The companies have said essential routes will operate with slight adjustments to accommodate the holiday.Public libraries and DMV offices will remain closed for the day. Local government offices in various states may also operate on reduced schedules or close altogether.The next federal holiday after Veterans Day is Thanksgiving, which falls on Thursday, November 27, followed by Christmas Day on Thursday, December 25. The first federal holiday of 2026 --New Year’s Day — will be observed the following week, on Thursday, January 1.Veterans Day remains one of 11 official US federal holidays recognised by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). For many Americans, it’s not only a day off work but also a day of remembrance — one that bridges solemn reflection with public gratitude for those who have served the country.","Veterans Day 2025 will be observed on Tuesday, November 11, across the United States.

In his final shareholder letter as CEO, Warren Buffett observed a growing pattern where chief executives' compensation continues to increase in a race for CEO pay.Buffett’s comments come days after Tesla approved a $1 trillion pay package for its CEO Elon Musk. The package, which requires the electric vehicle company to achieve an $8.5 trillion market capitalization, would elevate Musk, currently the world's wealthiest individual, to become the first person worth a trillion dollars. Musk's current net worth stands at approximately $449 billion.Subsequently, electric vehicle rival Rivian announced a $4.6 billion package for CEO RJ Scaringe spanning the next ten years, structured similarly to Musk's arrangement. The package, which would increase Scaringe's base salary of $2 billion twofold, is contingent upon the automobile manufacturer achieving specific operating income and cash flow objectives over the next seven years.Buffett indicated that chief executives are influenced by self-interest and avarice to increase their compensation after observing their rivals' rising pay packages.""What often bothers very wealthy CEOs—they are human, after all—is that other CEOs are getting even richer,"" he said according to a Fortune report. ""Envy and greed walk hand in hand. And what consultant ever recommended a serious cut in CEO compensation or board payments?”In his annual letter, Buffett shared insights from his 60-year tenure leading the conglomerate.He noted that the mandatory disclosure of executive compensation was initially meant to create awareness and perhaps discomfort amongst CEOs regarding their earnings. However, this initiative has produced an opposite effect.""During my lifetime, reformers sought to embarrass CEOs by requiring the disclosure of the compensation of the boss compared to what was being paid to the average employee,"" Buffett said. ""Proxy statements promptly ballooned to 100-plus pages compared to 20 or less earlier. But the good intentions didn't work; instead they backfired.""""Based on the majority of my observations—the CEO of company 'A' looked at his competitor at company 'B' and subtly conveyed to his board that he should be worth more. Of course, he also boosted the pay of directors and was careful who he placed on the compensation committee,"" he added. ""The new rules produced envy, not moderation,” he reportedly said.According to the Fortune report, statistics highlight this trend: amongst America's 100 largest low-wage employers, compensation packages increased by 34.7% from 2019 to 2024, according to an August report from the Institute for Policy Studies.The CEO-to-worker pay ratio rose from 560:1 in 2019 to 632:1 in 2024. An Oxfam report released this month indicates that the nation's wealthiest billionaires increased their wealth by $698 billion this year.Notably, Buffett maintains an annual salary of $100,000, although his investment portfolio contributes to his $150 billion net worth, positioning him as the world's 11th wealthiest individual.","Buffett’s comments come days after Tesla approved a $1 trillion pay package for its CEO Elon Musk.

Singapore’s green tax: Air passengers to additionally pay nearly $32 from 2026; levy to fund sustainable aviation fuel purchases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/singapores-green-tax-air-passengers-to-additionally-pay-nearly-32-from-2026-levy-to-fund-sustainable-aviation-fuel-purchases/articleshow/125242677.cms,"AI image





Singapore will soon introduce a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy of up to S$41.60 (around $31.95 or Rs 3,690) per passenger beginning next year, marking a significant step in its efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector.The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced that the levy will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing from October 1, 2026. Passengers transiting through Singapore will be exempt from the charge.Under the new system, the amount of levy will vary depending on travel class and route distance.Economy and premium economy travellers will pay S$1 for short-haul trips within Southeast Asia and S$10.40 for flights to the Americas.Business and first-class passengers will be charged four times that amount, reported Bloomberg.Cargo flights will also face a separate fee, calculated by weight.The funds raised through this levy will support the centralised purchase of sustainable aviation fuel — typically produced from waste oils or agricultural feedstock — as part of Singapore’s plan to achieve an SAF adoption rate of 3–5% by 2030.According to CAAS, a drop in SAF costs has allowed the levy to remain lower than earlier projections, which had estimated rates between S$3 and S$16.Singapore becomes the first country in the world to impose a passenger-based green fuel tax — a move especially notable given its position as a major global aviation hub.Changi Airport is on track for a record year, with passenger traffic expected to surpass its pre-pandemic peak of 68.3 million in 2019.Although aviation contributes only around 1.2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, as per the European Commission cited by Bloomberg, the industry continues to face significant challenges in cutting emissions due to limited SAF availability and high production costs.The International Air Transport Association noted that while global SAF production doubled last year, it still accounted for just 0.3% of total jet fuel volumes.Singapore’s announcement coincides with the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, where nearly 200 countries are discussing measures to strengthen global climate action.","Singapore will introduce a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy of up to S$41.60 (around $31.95 or Rs 3,690) per passenger beginning next year.

Markets watch: Asian stocks rise as US shutdown nears end; oil prices stay under pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/markets-watch-asian-stocks-rise-as-us-shutdown-nears-end-oil-prices-stay-under-pressure/articleshow/125238844.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AP)





Asian stocks continued to climb for a second straight day on Tuesday as signs emerged that US lawmakers were close to resolving the country’s record-long government shutdown.The positive sentiment also lifted global markets, though oil prices remained subdued amid concerns about oversupply and slowing demand.At 0230 GMT, the Nikkei was up 0.4% at 51,131.28, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged 0.1% higher to 26,680.73, while Shanghai slipped 0.3% to 4,008.61.In Washington, senators on Monday night passed a compromise budget deal after several Democrats sided with Republicans to fund government departments through January.If the measure clears the House of Representatives, the government could reopen by Friday. “It appears to us this morning that our long national nightmare is finally coming to an end,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said, while President Donald Trump told reporters that the deal was “very good” and that the country would be “opening up very quickly.”According to Reuters, the progress in Washington boosted risk appetite across markets, with Japan, South Korea, and Australia opening higher.The S&P 500 jumped 1.5% on Monday and the Nasdaq 100 gained 2.2%, while the MSCI All Country World Index recorded its best session since June.Commodities, cryptocurrencies, and industrial metals such as aluminium and copper also saw gains.The dollar weakened, while gold and Bitcoin rallied.Analysts said the reopening would help restore the flow of key US data on jobs and inflation, which could guide the Federal Reserve’s next interest-rate decision. “Reopening would not only boost sentiment but also open the way for data releases,” said Fiona Cincotta of City Index, as quoted by Bloomberg.Meanwhile, oil prices were weighed down by rising production and sanctions-related disruptions.Brent crude slipped 0.4% to $63.83 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate dropped to $59.90, according to AFP.As per Reuters, while optimism over the US budget deal supported broader market sentiment, “worries about crude oversupply” limited oil’s recovery.Analysts at energy consultancy Ritterbusch and Associates noted that as OPEC production continues to rise, “global oil balances are acquiring an increasingly bearish hue” due to weaker demand and slower growth in major consuming nations.Earlier this month, OPEC+ agreed to increase December output targets by 137,000 barrels per day, the same pace as in previous months, but will pause hikes in the first quarter of next year.Adding to oil market jitters, new US sanctions on Russian firms Rosneft and Lukoil had begun to bite. Lukoil reportedly declared force majeure at its Iraqi oil field, and Bulgaria prepared to seize its Burgas refinery. The sanctions have also caused a surge in crude stored in Asian waters as exports to China and India fell.Some refiners in both countries have turned to Middle Eastern suppliers instead.Ritterbusch analysts added that a key uncertainty for oil’s outlook “is the extent to which China will continue to push Russian supplies into strategic stockpiles and whether India will succumb to Trump’s suggestions to defer further purchases from Russia.","Nikkei was up 0.4% at 51,131.28, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged 0.1% higher to 26,680.73, while Shanghai slipped 0.3% to 4,008.61.

US President Donald Trump on Monday, once again claimed that India has stopped Russian oil imports and added that they are going to ""bring down the tariffs"" imposed on New Delhi.When asked about how close a trade deal with India is and whether he is willing to consider lowering the current tariff rate, Trump said, ""Well, right now, the tariffs are very high on India because of the Russian oil, and they've stopped doing the Russian oil. It's been reduced very substantially.

US-China trade tensions: Beijing rolls back 'special port fees' on US vessels for one year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-china-trade-tensions-beijing-rolls-back-special-port-fees-on-us-vessels-for-one-year/articleshow/125220765.cms,"‘FOOLS’: Trump Promises To Pay $2,000 Tariff Cheque To Americans, Sends Shockwaves In US





The United States and China have begun rolling back trade actions, after the Busan meeting ended with “a great success.”Beijing recently suspended the export ban on ‘dual use’ materials while US reduced the fentanyl related duties from 20% to 10%.China also suspended the ‘special port fees’ on US vessels.The transport ministry announced that from 13:01 (05:01 GMT) on Monday, “special port fees” will no longer apply to ships that are either operated by or constructed in the United States when they call at Chinese ports. The decision will remain in place for one year and comes “simultaneously” with Washington’s decision to pause its own port charges on Chinese-built and operated vessels.This marks another step in the gradual rollback of tariff actions that escalated over several months, during which duties reached triple-digit levels. Those penalties stalled trade between the world’s two biggest economies and disrupted global supply routes. The current easing follows a meeting between presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump in South Korea last month, where both sides agreed to retract some punitive measures.The rivalry over commercial influence has also brought attention to global shipbuilding trends. The United States, once dominant in the years following the Second World War, now produces only 0.1% of the world’s commercial ships.Asian shipyards lead the industry, with China constructing nearly half of the vessels launched globally, followed by South Korea and Japan.In a parallel development, Beijing confirmed the suspension of sanctions placed on several US subsidiaries of Hanwha Ocean, one of South Korea’s largest shipbuilders. The one-year suspension, effective from 10 November, corresponds with the US decision to halt port fees on ships connected to China, according to a separate statement released by China’s commerce ministry.“In light of this (US suspension)... China has decided to suspend the relevant measures” for one year, the ministry said, as cited by AFP.China introduced those sanctions in October, accusing the subsidiaries of supporting a US government “Section 301” investigation that labelled China’s dominance in the shipbuilding sector as unreasonable. The sanctions prohibited organisations and individuals in China from working with Hanwha Shipping LLC, Hanwha Philly Shipyard Inc., Hanwha Ocean USA International LLC, Hanwha Shipping Holdings LLC and HS USA Holdings Corp.A planned investigation into whether that Section 301 probe affected the “security and development interests” of China’s shipbuilding industry and supply chain has also been halted for one year, according to the transport ministry.These latest suspensions form part of a wider sequence of reciprocal steps taken after the Xi–Trump discussions. On Wednesday, Beijing said it would extend the one-year suspension of additional tariffs on US goods, keeping them at 10%, while also dropping some tariffs on soybeans and other agricultural imports from the United States.In the past week, China has also stopped enforcing an export ban on gallium, germanium and antimony, metals considered crucial for modern technologies. It additionally paused a one-year restriction on rare earths technology exports.The Chinese commerce ministry said Washington, for its part, agreed to suspend its export restrictions on affiliates of blacklisted foreign companies where those entities hold a stake of at least 50%.","Beijing recently suspended the export ban on ‘dual use’ materials while US reduced the fentanyl related duties from 20% to 10%.

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders

H-1B visa fee hike: How US is asking for evidence

H-1B visa noose tightens





The Donald Trump administration is tightening its noose, cracking down and seeking evidence of the $100,000 H-1B visa fee. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has started sending requests for evidence seeking the $100,000 H-1B fee, amidst increased immigration oversight in the region.This action follows the executive order issued in September that established a $100,000 fee requirement for new H-1B applications submitted by candidates outside the United States and those needing consular processing after September 21.When immigration officials determine insufficient documentation exists to approve an application, the USCIS issues a request for evidence.Several immigration specialists informed ET that requests for evidence are appearing in cases where the fee requirement is not applicable, citing ambiguity regarding who must pay the $100,000 fee. This situation could lead to additional legal challenges. This change predominantly affects Indians, who represent 70% of H-1B visa recipients.Gnanamookan Senthurjothi, who established The Visa Code, noted that requests for evidence demanding the $100,000 fee are being sent for H-1B ""recapture time"" applications.The H-1B recapture time provision enables individuals to recover unused portions of their six-year limit in the United States by requesting the USCIS to include time spent outside the country for durations exceeding 24 hours.Request for Evidence (RFEs) continue to be distributed whilst ambiguity persists regarding the proclamation, notwithstanding USCIS's explanatory notes.At the Murthy Law Firm in Maryland, managing attorney Adam Rosen identified a fundamental concern within the proclamation's text. ""The proclamation used the term 'visa' interchangeably with 'status' despite both holding separate meanings independent of one another,"" he said.Additionally, Rosen addressed the validity of the fee requirement. Though section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act authorises presidential control over entry conditions, the proclamation requires payment from the petitioner rather than the entering beneficiary.Legal experts suggest a dual response strategy for RFE recipients. Initially, submit a response demonstrating fee exemption based on USCIS's restricted interpretation of the proclamation. Subsequently, if denied due to non-payment, Rosen advises that the decision ""can be challenged in federal court"", considering this the ""optimal solution"".Various legal actions have been initiated in US courts, including submissions from the US Chamber of Commerce and H-1B representatives, contesting the fee implementation.Boundless Immigration's CEO, Xiao Wang, suggests these applications were likely processed between initial qualification and USCIS's October 20 formal guidance. ""While this has created some confusion for employers who thought they understood the rules, right now it shouldn't be taken as an indication that the administration intends to expand the definition of who must pay the $100k filing fee,"" he said.Legal action, though available, remains challenging for many individuals. According to Kate Kalmykov, who co-chairs the immigration and compliance practice at Florida-based Greenberg Traurig law firm, ""Filing a lawsuit is generally a measure of last resort. Litigation can be both time-consuming and costly.""The mounting expenses and unpredictable outcomes are influencing how organisations approach recruitment, as noted by Kalmykov. ""At this time, some companies may choose to reassess their sponsorship strategies: either pausing new H-1B filings for overseas talent or relocating employees abroad to avoid the significant additional costs now associated with H-1B sponsorship under consular processing,"" she said.Wang highlighted a notable transition towards independent immigration planning. ""The H-1B's volatility is driving both individuals and employers to explore pathways that don't depend on lottery systems or sudden policy changes. Companies are also investing more in upskilling domestic workers while selectively using immigration for truly critical roles,"" he said.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services has started sending requests for evidence seeking the $100,000 H-1B fee.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

Gold Price Outlook

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are likely to maintain their bullish trend over the coming few weeks, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. The expert shares his views and recommendations for gold investors: Gold began the week on an impressive bullish note, soaring to fresh all-time highs above $3,650/Oz in Spot. The move extended last week’s rally amid growing conviction that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may cut interest rates at its September monetary policy meeting, a shift markets now treat as a near certainty following a string of weak US labour market data.The US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Friday showed a slowdown in hiring in August, while the Unemployment Rate rose to the highest level since 2021, confirming that labour market conditions in the world’s biggest economy are slumping.Apart from this, political turmoil in Japan and France, along with persistent geopolitical tensions, contributed to limiting any corrective pullback for the spot gold pair. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics to publish the preliminary estimate of the annual revision of Nonfarm Payrolls later on Tuesday night, might drive the USD & USD/JPY pair leading to volatile moves in gold prices.Additionally, rising demand from major central banks have contributed to the upside so far as Official data showed this week that the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) added gold to its reserves in August, extending purchases of bullion into a 10th straight month although the pace of buying slows down due to higher prices.Traders now look to the US Producer Price Index (PPI) & the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), due on Wednesday & Thursday, respectively, for a fresh impetus & direction. If the report comes in hotter than-expected the outcome could boost the US Dollar (USD) & weigh on yellow metal leading to profit booking moves.Overall, the fundamental backdrop suggests that the path of least resistance for the spot gold is to the upside, though overbought conditions warrant some caution in near term.From a technical perspective in spot gold, on a daily time frame technical indicators like RSI holds well above the 70.0 mark which makes it prudent to wait for some near-term consolidation or a modest pullback before positioning for the next leg up. Any corrective decline following through to data in the days ahead, could still attract dip-buyers near the $3,600 - 3540 per oz levels which presents an intermediate support enroute last Thursday's corrective phase.Meanwhile, the trend remains bullish on a medium-term perspective of 3 - 4 weeks as an upside target of $ 3720 - 3750 per oz looks likely to be tested in spot markets which translates to a range of Rs 1,12,000 - 1,12,500 per 10 gm. levels on MCX futures contract","Gold began the week on an impressive bullish note, soaring to fresh all-time highs above $3,650/Oz in Spot.

IDBI Bank files new insolvency plea against Zee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/idbi-bank-files-new-insolvency-plea-against-zee/articleshow/123820761.cms,"

Zee was a guarantor to the Siti loan.According to Zee, in 2022, the bank had previously filed an insolvency case against the company regarding the same debt claim. However, this application was dismissed by the Mumbai company law tribunal in May 2023. The bank then challenged the Mumbai order before the company law appellate tribunal in Delhi, but the appeal was also dismissed in April 2025.Zee said IDBI also attempted to make a claim of the same debt under the debt recovery act by first filing an original application before the debts recovery tribunal in Mumbai, which was later withdrawn, and then before the debts recovery tribunal in Delhi.The Delhi debts recovery tribunal dismissed the application in Jan this year and the bank filed an appeal against this order before the debts recovery appellate tribunal in Delhi, which is still pending adjudication.", IDBI Bank has once again dragged Zee Entertainment Enterprises to the insolvency court.

Klarna IPO debut: Stock jumps 30% on NYSE listing; Swedish BNPL firm eyes US market growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/klarna-ipo-debut-stock-jumps-30-on-nyse-listing-swedish-bnpl-firm-eyes-us-market-growth/articleshow/123814628.cms,"



Shares of Swedish buy-now-pay-later company Klarna surged 30% in their much-anticipated public debut on the New York Stock Exchange, opening at $52 compared to the IPO price of $40 set late Tuesday.More than 34 million shares worth about $1.37 billion were sold, making it the largest IPO this year, according to Renaissance Capital. It took specialists on the NYSE floor nearly three-and-a-half hours to manually price the first batch of trades, AP reported.The listing comes in one of the busiest years for IPOs, alongside debuts from Figma and Circle Internet Group. Upcoming offerings include StubHub and Gemini, the crypto exchange majority owned by the Winklevoss twins.Founded in 2005, Klarna entered the US market in 2015 through a partnership with Macy’s. Today, it works with hundreds of thousands of merchants and has struck deals with Walmart and other retailers. Klarna will trade under the ticker “KLAR.”“It’s the largest consumer market in the world, and it’s the biggest credit card market in the world. It’s a tremendous opportunity, from our perspective,” CEO and co-founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski told the Associated Press ahead of the IPO.Klarna’s popular “pay-in-4” plan lets customers split purchases into four instalments over six weeks.

Who is Larry Ellison?

Why are Oracle shares soaring?

Larry Ellison’s investments





Larry Ellison has dethroned Elon Musk to become the world’s richest person with a net worth of $393 billion. Oracle’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) saw his wealth increase by $101 billion as of 10:10 a.m. in New York, following Oracle Corp. 's exceptional quarterly performance, according to Bloomberg.The 81-year-old executive's net worth expanded significantly after Oracle Corp. presented an optimistic forecast for its cloud operations, resulting in a substantial rise in its share price.The Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates that Ellison's wealth reached $393 billion, surpassing Musk's $385 billion, as recorded at 10:10 a.m. in New York. This single-day increase represents the highest gain ever documented by the index.Ellison's ownership of approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares, which increased 40% to $338 on Wednesday morning, contributed to this wealth accumulation.The company's shares experienced a dramatic rise after Oracle announced an unexpectedly strong growth projection on Tuesday evening.Larry Ellison, a college dropout, went on to establish Oracle Corp.,which became one of the world's leading technology enterprises. In July this year, he surpassed Mark Zuckerberg to claim the position of second-richest person globally, and within two months, he has overtaken Elon Musk.His remarkable financial success has been paired with an extravagant lifestyle. His acquisitions include megayachts, private aircraft, prestigious properties and a Hawaiian island, according to a Bloomberg report.Larry Ellison serves as co-founder and principal shareholder of Oracle, a prominent software organisation renowned for its database system, which supports numerous major corporate operations worldwide. The company has recently achieved success in cloud computing infrastructure, a sector where Amazon.com Inc. maintains significant influence.At 81, Ellison maintains ownership of over 40% of Oracle, now based in Austin, Texas, which forms the primary component of his assets. His portfolio includes investments in Tesla Inc., a sailing organisation, the Indian Wells tennis tournament, and substantial property holdings, including Hawaii's Lanai island.Adopted at nine months old by his mother's aunt and uncle, Ellison grew up in Chicago's south side. After leaving studies at both the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago, he relocated to Berkeley, California. There, he secured employment at Ampex as a computer programmer, where he contributed to developing a database called Oracle for the Central Intelligence Agency.In 1977, Ellison, along with two partners, established the company that would later become Oracle. The company went public on March 12, 1986, just one day before Microsoft Corp.'s IPO. After serving as Oracle's chief executive officer until September 2014, he transitioned to the roles of chairman and chief technology officer.Oracle's current surge in prominence stems from its substantial investments in cloud infrastructure services, providing internet-based computing and storage capabilities. The company's market position has strengthened considerably due to the growing demand from AI companies and startups seeking additional computing capacity.Oracle's shares experienced remarkable growth, with values tripling since ChatGPT's public debut in November 2022.The company's success continued with significant achievements earlier in the year. A notable milestone occurred when Oracle secured a substantial 4.5-gigawatt data centre capacity agreement with OpenAI, ChatGPT's operator, in July.The company's client portfolio includes prominent tech firms like Nvidia Corp. and ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok. These developments position Oracle as a significant competitor to established cloud service providers Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.The company's standing has been enhanced by Ellison's connections with US President Donald Trump, the Bloomberg report said. As a long-term Republican donor and Trump supporter, Ellison has seen Oracle receive increased recognition since Trump's return to office in January.Oracle participates in the $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure initiative, announced by Trump in January. The administration supports Oracle's potential acquisition of TikTok's US operations, which would grant Oracle ownership in a globally popular consumer platform. While Trump endorses Oracle's joint bid for ByteDance's video application, Chinese authorities have yet to approve the transaction.According to Bloomberg, Ellison has invested extensively in luxury properties across the United States over the last ten years. His portfolio includes residences in Malibu and Rancho Mirage, California, the historic Beechwood Mansion in Newport, Rhode Island, and a Japanese-influenced estate in the San Francisco Bay Area.As a significant Tesla investor, Ellison held approximately 1.5% ownership according to the company's 2022 proxy statement. Following his departure from Tesla's board in June 2022, his current shareholding remains undisclosed. He was also a substantial supporter of Musk's acquisition of Twitter, now known as X.The Oracle founder's lifestyle choices reflect his considerable wealth. A 2002 communication from his accountant, referenced in a January 2006 San Francisco Chronicle article, advised him to exercise more financial restraint. Ellison maintains his standard of living through a combination of debt financing and proceeds from Oracle shares and dividends, which have exceeded $12 billion since 2003, based on Bloomberg's data analysis.","The 81-year-old executive's net worth expanded significantly after Oracle Corp. presented an optimistic forecast for its cloud operations, resulting in a substantial rise in its share price.

Federal Reserve board nomination: Senate panel clears Trump pick Stephen Miran; Democrats flag loyalty test risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/federal-reserve-board-nomination-senate-panel-clears-trump-pick-stephen-miran-democrats-flag-loyalty-test-risk/articleshow/123812626.cms,"



A US Senate committee on Wednesday advanced the nomination of President Donald Trump’s choice for the Federal Reserve board, Stephen Miran, despite concerns that he may not resign from the White House even if confirmed.Miran, who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), cleared the Senate Banking Committee by a narrow 13-11 vote, with Democrats opposing the move, AFP reported. The approval paves the way for his full Senate confirmation, which could allow him to join the central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in time for its September 16–17 policy meeting, AFP reported.Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the banking committee, criticised the nomination, warning it “sets up an obvious Trump loyalty test.” She argued that Miran’s rate votes could decide whether he is able to return to the White House role once his short Fed term ends.If confirmed, Miran would fill a short-term Fed vacancy lasting slightly over four months until January 2026. At his hearing, Miran said he only intended to take a leave of absence from the CEA during that period but later told lawmakers he would resign if nominated and confirmed for a longer term.Democratic lawmakers issued a letter after his testimony, warning that any decisions he took at the Fed would be seen as an attempt “to satisfy the demands of the President” and safeguard his White House position. Warren also expressed concern that he had not guaranteed to step down at the end of the short term if confirmed.The Fed’s seven-member board of governors holds 12 voting seats on the FOMC, which sets US interest rates. Since cutting rates in December, the Fed has kept policy steady this year while monitoring the effects of Trump’s sweeping tariffs on inflation. Analysts now expect a rate cut next week, citing limited tariff impact on prices but growing weakness in the jobs market.","Stephen Miran, who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, cleared the Senate Banking Committee by a narrow 13-11 vote.

Oracle shares surged about 35% on Wednesday after the company highlighted a surge in demand for its cloud services from AI firms, signalling a deeper push into the infrastructure supporting artificial intelligence systems.The growth in Oracle’s cloud business reflects a broader industry trend, with companies such as OpenAI and xAI ramping up spending on massive computing capacity needed to stay competitive in the AI race, boosting annual investments to hundreds of billions of dollars.The stock was up 34.7%, reaching a record high of $325.90 in early trading, marking its largest single-day jump since 1992. If these gains hold, Oracle will add approximately $237 billion to its market valuation, bringing the total to around $915 billion and moving closer to the coveted $1 trillion club. Shares have risen 45% so far this year, outperforming the so-called Magnificent Seven and the broader S&P 500 index, with investors betting heavily on AI-driven cloud firms, Reuters reported.Oracle’s results also lifted shares of Nvidia (NVDA.O), Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices, which supply semiconductors for data centers, with gains ranging between 2.8% and 4.6% in early trading. Competitor CoreWeave (CRWV.O) shares were up 17%.Oracle reported four multi-billion-dollar contracts with three clients during the August quarter, reflecting strong demand for its cloud services. CEO Safra Catz said, “Over the next few months, we expect to sign up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers and RPO is likely to exceed half-a-trillion dollars. ”Despite Oracle’s gains, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud continue to dominate the cloud market with a combined 65% share, while Oracle, Alibaba, CoreWeave, and others hold smaller slices. Oracle has also partnered with Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft to allow their cloud customers to run Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) alongside native services, with revenues from these partnerships increasing more than sixteen-fold in the first quarter.Ben Reitzes, analyst at Melius Research, said, “What matters here is that this figure now includes contributions from the Stargate venture and two other big AI players, meaning revenues beyond 2026 go much higher.” Analysts noted Oracle’s involvement in SoftBank and OpenAI’s Stargate project as a major tailwind, giving the company a strategic foothold in large-scale AI infrastructure expected to channel about $500 billion in spending, Reuters reported.Oracle also provides cloud services to xAI, the AI startup founded by Elon Musk, who is a longtime ally of Oracle chairman Larry Ellison. Ellison, 81, whose net worth is largely derived from his 41% stake in Oracle, is fast approaching Musk in the race for the world’s richest title, according to Forbes data. Oracle’s stock currently trades at over 33.34 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, compared with Amazon’s 32.34 and Microsoft’s 30.83.","Oracle reported four multi-billion-dollar contracts with three clients during the August quarter.

Wall Street moved higher on Wednesday as an unexpectedly encouraging report on wholesale inflation and strong corporate growth forecasts from Oracle buoyed investor sentiment, pushing major indexes toward record territory.The S&P 500 gained 0.5% and was on track to set an all-time high for a second straight day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 49 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.5% after both indexes also hit records the previous day, AP reported.Stocks have been rallying as Wall Street anticipates a delicate balancing act: an economy slowing enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but not so much that it risks a recession, all while keeping inflation in check. Wednesday’s report showed US wholesale inflation unexpectedly slowed in August, easing concerns after months of upward pressure, including tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.Chris Larkin, managing director for trading and investing at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley, said, “The report essentially rolled out the red carpet for a Fed rate cut next week.” Research strategist Ahmad Assiri at Pepperstone added, “The broader narrative is increasingly anchored on expectations that the Fed will deliver a rate cut at next week’s meeting.”Tech stocks led the rally after Oracle projected strong AI-driven growth. CEO Safra Catz said the company signed four multi-billion-dollar contracts in its latest quarter and expects cloud infrastructure revenue to jump 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year, with further growth to $144 billion in four years. Oracle stock soared 34.8%, marking its potential best day since 1992. Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said, “AI changes everything. ”Other beneficiaries of the AI boom included Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., whose US-traded shares rose 3.1% after reporting August revenue up nearly 34% year-on-year, and Nvidia, up 3.7%, driving gains in the S&P 500. On the downside, Synopsys fell 31.3% after missing profit expectations and issuing a cautious forecast.Meanwhile, Swedish “buy now, pay later” firm Klarna made its US debut, pricing its shares at $40 each, $4 higher than expected.Overseas markets were mixed, with South Korea’s Kospi climbing 1.7% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rising 1%, while European indexes saw modest gains.In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield eased to 4.05% from 4.08% late Tuesday as wholesale inflation data supported expectations for upcoming Fed rate cuts.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 49 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time.

‘Modi & I Will Always Be Friends’: Trump’s Stunning U-TURN After Claiming US Lost India To China





: The irresistible force that is America and the immovable object that is India are re-engaging in trade talks again after leaders of both nations exchanged amicable messages following weeks of invective from the MAGA supremo and his minions in an effort to browbeat New Delhi over tariff issues and its ties with Russia.After nearly calling off talks over India not ceding ground on throwing open its markets to American satisfaction and on ending purchase of Russian oil which Washington says is fueling Moscow’s war on Ukraine, US President Donald Trump reached out for a second time in three days through social media, saying the two sides are ""continuing negotiations"" and he feels certain they will come to a successful conclusion on the issue of trade barriers. He did not refer to the Russian oil purchase issue.PM Modi responded to Trump’s outreach soon after, saying he is confident the trade negotiations ""will pave the way for unlocking the limitless potential of the India-US partnership.” The US President reposted Modi's response.Trump’s friendly 63-word social media post came after weeks of strife between the two sides triggered by the President himself dissing New Delhi with an angry jibe about its “dead economy” after slapping a 25 percent penalty on top of 25 percent tariff on imports from India because of its purchase of Russian oil.Trump minions aggravated the situation with unhinged tirades even as New Delhi doubled down on its right to buy Russian oil as talks between the two sides stalled, although communication channels remained open.Analysts parsed Trump’s post (and Modi’s response) to read the tea leaves, with the consensus being the outreach is spurred by the realization that Washington’s heavy-handed approach is driving India into the Russia-China orbit and solidifying BRICS. Trump himself ruefully noted in a post last week that he may have “lost” India (and Russia) to “deepest darkest China.”Outside of the toxic MAGA echo chamber, well-meaning interlocutors repeatedly warned the White House that alienating India, a natural partner, is not a good idea.“It takes a lot of effort to drive Narendra Modi to the point he is holding hands with Xi and Putin. That's one thing we must be really careful about…trust is at the core of alliances and partnerships and if we erode that it can be very difficult to rebuild,” William Burns former CIA Director said in think-tank engagement.Indeed, the crisis is far from over though. In a clear indication that there are still plenty of misgivings between the two sides despite his outreach, Trump on Tuesday pressured the European Union to hit China and India with tariffs of up to 100% to force Russian president Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. The US President’s call to EU leaders came even as India is trying to quickly conclude a trade deal with EU to offset potential loss of the US markets due to high tariffs and sanctions. A trade delegation from EU will be in New Delhi on Friday for talks.It is not clear when the two sides will resume formal talks, but Trump was effusive in saying he looks forward to speaking with ""my very good friend,"" Prime Minister Modi, in the ""upcoming weeks,” indicating there is still plenty of ground to cover and there’s no immediate resolution at hand.On his part, PM Modi conspicuously abjured any reference to personal friendship while asserting “India and the US are close friends and natural partners.” He also said he is looking forward to speaking with Trump after reports surfaced last month that he has avoided calls from the US President.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent among others had accused India of “stringing us along” with protracted talks, expressing frustration at not being able to move New Delhi on what it considers non-negotiable red lines, notably agriculture and dairy sectors. There are no indications that India has resiled from that position although Trump claimed in a post last week that New Delhi had agreed to “cut their tariffs to nothing,” presumably in other sectors.","US President Donald Trump reached out for a second time in three days through social media, saying the two sides are ""continuing negotiations"" He did not refer to the Russian oil purchase issue.

Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk on Wednesday announced plans to reduce its global workforce by 11 percent, eliminating 9,000 positions, including 5,000 in Denmark.The move aims to save eight billion kroner ($1.3 billion) as competition intensifies for its anti-obesity treatments Ozempic and Wegovy, as reported by AFP.The company also lowered its earnings forecast for the third time this year, projecting operating profit growth between four and 10 percent, down from the earlier range of 10-16 percent. The announcement helped lift Novo Nordisk’s shares by more than three percent during midday trading in Copenhagen.The company described the restructuring as part of a ""company-wide transformation to simplify its organisation, improve the speed of decision-making, and reallocate resources towards the company's growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity.""Novo Nordisk’s weight-loss injections had previously boosted its market position, driving the workforce expansion from 43,700 employees in 2020 to 78,400 currently. The company’s growth significantly contributed to Denmark’s economic performance in 2023.Chief Executive Mike Doustdar, who succeeded Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen in August, emphasised the need for adaptation in increasingly competitive markets.Palle Sorensen, chief economist at Nykredit bank, noted the domestic impact: the 5,000 job cuts in Denmark are ""equivalent to two months of job growth in Denmark.""The company faces rising competition from US-based Eli Lilly’s obesity treatments. Production constraints also led to temporary FDA authorisation for pharmacies to compound Ozempic and Wegovy, which expired on May 22.Ozempic, an injectable anti-diabetic drug, gained attention for its weight-loss effects on social media, while Wegovy, containing the same active ingredient in a different dosage, is marketed specifically for weight loss. Both drugs use GLP-1 hormone analogues to regulate blood glucose and appetite.Market analysts suggest management may have underestimated competition and misread their market position. The company’s transformation plan is aimed at addressing rising global demand while navigating a rapidly evolving obesity treatment market.","Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk announced plans to reduce its global workforce by 11 percent.

Trump Aide's Big Hint





The American workforce is sharply divided on the role of foreign talent, with 56% of US citizens saying H-1B visa holders are taking their jobs, a new survey by Blind has revealed.The poll, conducted between August 25 and September 3 among 4,230 professionals, highlights deep splits between citizens and immigrants. While 70% of all respondents acknowledged H-1B workers help US companies grow, only 49% of citizens agreed, compared to 87% of foreign-born professionals.The divide widens when it comes to hiring priorities. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of professionals said companies should hire the best talent regardless of citizenship, but 60% of US citizens want preference for citizens and green card holders. In contrast, just 11% of H-1B workers and 35% of permanent residents shared that view.Perhaps most telling, one in three respondents overall said H-1B workers create “unfair competition.” Among citizens, that number jumped to more than half (56%), underscoring tensions in an economy already facing layoffs and political scrutiny.The debate isn’t just abstract. JD Vance recently blasted Big Tech for hiring H-1B replacements while laying off Americans, and controversies like the Walmart layoff scandal have kept the issue in the spotlight.On Blind, professionals echoed these divides. A Microsoft employee complained, “The H1B and other visa programs are out of control… we have enough SWE graduates in the US now.” Others pushed back. An Amazon professional argued, “Stopping H-1B renewals just moves cutting-edge development to another country. Tech follows talent.”","56% of US citizens say H-1B visa holders are taking their jobs, a new survey by Blind has revealed.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter.

The seasonally adjusted S&P Global India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at 55.3 in February, little-changed from 55.4 in January.The February PMI data pointed to an improvement in overall operating conditions for the 20th straight month.

Job creation failed to gain meaningful traction as firms reportedly had sufficient staff to cope with current requirements, said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.The domestic market was the main source of new business growth, as new orders from abroad increased only fractionally. The rise in international sales was the weakest in the current 11-month period of expansion.""... most of the upturn in new orders welcomed by firms was domestically driven as international sales rose at a marginal pace that was the weakest in almost a year,"" Lima said.On the prices front, input cost inflation accelerated to a four-month high, with firms mentioning higher prices for electronic components, energy, foodstuff, metals and textiles.""After slipping to a 26-month low last November, input cost inflation surged in every month since. The latest rise was historically subdued, however, and among the weakest in around two years.""The survey showed some reluctance among manufacturers to pass on cost increase to clients, with output charge inflation easing since January,"" Lima said.Meanwhile, business confidence improved in February, with firms expecting demand strength, new product releases and investments to bode well for growth prospects.The S&P Global India Manufacturing PMI is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers in a panel of around 400 manufacturers.

According to Bajaj Broking Research, NMDC and Polyplex Corp are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for May 23, 2025:

Index View: NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in the broad range of 56,000-53,500 in the last 5 weeks.

A key technical observation on the daily chart is that the index has been trading within a downward-sloping channel for the past 21 sessions. In the last 21 sessions it has retraced just 38.2% of the prior 9-session rally (49,157–56,098), indicating a shallow pullback that suggests underlying strength and potential higher bottom formation

We expect the index to extend the last 5 weeks’ consolidation in the range of 53,500-56,000.

Within the consolidation we believe dips should be used as a buying opportunity. Key support placed at 53,000-53,500 being the confluence of the lower band of the last 5 weeks range, key retracement and 50 days EMA.

Stock market recommendations:Indian equity markets traded with downward bias during the current week weighed down by weak global cues and profit-taking in key sectors. Investor sentiment turned cautious following Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. government’s credit outlook, which led to a spike in U.S. Treasury yields and triggered a broad-based sell-off across global equity markets. The risk-off sentiment reverberated through Asian and European bourses, with Indian benchmarks mirroring the global weakness.The India VIX rose more than 5% over the week, signaling heightened volatility and risk aversion among market participants.On the technical front, the Nifty registered a high of 25,116 last week. However, profit-booking at elevated levels over the past 4-5 sessions led to a retracement, with the index currently hovering near the 24,600 marks.In the near term, we expect the index to enter a consolidation phase within the 24,350–25,000 range, thereby alleviating the overbought conditions indicated by the daily stochastic oscillator following the recent sharp uptrend.Crucial support is seen at the 24,350–24,400 zone, which coincides with the prior week’s low, the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the preceding rally from 23,935 to 25,116. On the upside, resistance is seen around 25,000–25,200 levels, aligning with the 78.6% retracement of the entire decline (26,277-21,744).The stock is at the cusp of generating a breakout above last 2 months consolidation range (71-60) signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.It is currently seen sustaining above the short- and medium-term moving averages. With the 20-, 50- and 200-days EMA all placed around 265-275 highlighting strong support at lower levels.The 14 periods RSI in the daily chart is seen sustaining above its nine periods average thus validates positive bias in the stock. We expect the stock to head higher towards 78 levels in the medium term being the 161.8% external retracement of the previous decline (71-60).The stock has recently generated a breakout above a bullish Cup & Handle formation with strong volume signaling continuation of the up move thus offering fresh entry opportunity.It is currently seen forming higher high and higher low in the daily and weekly chart thus supporting the positive bias in the stock.The daily MACD has recently generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validates positive bias in the stock. We expect the stock to head higher towards 1478 being the confluence of all time high and the measuring implication of the bullish cup & handle breakout.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, NMDC and Polyplex Corp are the top stock picks for today.

India cracks down on suspected goods trade with Pakistan! The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of India is investigating approximately 20 export houses suspected of engaging in illicit money transfers with Pakistan through the UAE corridor. These export houses are being suspected for goods trade as a way to launder money to and from Pakistan via the UAE.The investigation centres on dubious financial activities, particularly cash in advance (CIA) payments and overseas agent commissions, which were potentially used to disguise money laundering. CIA transactions require purchasers to remit payment before goods dispatch.The transactions under investigation involve low-quality jewellery, semi-precious stones, cosmetics, fragrances, dry fruits and electrical equipment, amongst other items.""We are looking at the trade-based money laundering between India and Pakistan where they used dummy business basically to send money out of India. About 20 export houses are under scanner,"" a senior official informed ET.The official confirmed that relevant authorities have been notified to investigate potential terrorism connections.The investigating authority is specifically examining transactions over the previous 14 months, where there are suspicions of significantly inflated product prices and commissions, with multiple accounts utilised to conceal the origin of funds.""Some transactions were exceptionally high for the product category and in one case the payment to the agent, based in UAE, was higher than the total cost of the consignment,"" the official added.Also Read | ‘Big ban’ actions: How India is shunning Pakistan and its allies like Turkey & Azerbaijan - top 5 measures To illustrate this, the official provided details about an ordinary electrical conductor component, typically valued at ₹100 per unit in the market, being imported at an extraordinarily high price range of ₹8,000-19,000 per unit.Additionally, basic costume jewellery, with a standard market value between ₹100-150, was sent to UAE and subsequently to Pakistan at an inflated price of ₹30,000 per piece.Cross-border cash transactions face increasing challenges due to stringent customs procedures and digital economy advancements, compelling criminals to devise new money laundering methods, the report said. Authorities worldwide maintain vigilance against trade-based money laundering activities, according to officials.The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) collaborated with Hong Kong authorities last year to uncover a scheme involving synthetic diamonds. These low-cost diamonds were imported into India at values inflated by more than 100 times, facilitating illegal foreign currency transfers from India.Further investigations revealed that the importing entity was also engaged in exporting diamond-studded jewellery to Hong Kong and several other countries at substantially inflated values.Also Read | India-Pakistan ceasefire: How India's punitive measures will continue to hit Pakistan's fragile economy - explained","The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of India is investigating approximately 20 export houses suspected of engaging in illicit money transfers with Pakistan through the UAE corridor.

TCS probes possible link to M&S cyber breach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tcs-probes-possible-link-to-ms-cyber-breach/articleshow/121371467.cms,"TCS

MUMBAI: Tata Group's flagship software services company, TCS, is investigating whether it was the entry point for a cyberattack on UK retailer Marks and Spencer, the Financial Times reported on Friday. The breach occurred during the Easter weekend. TCS, which has worked with M&S for over ten years, aims to finish the probe by the end of the month. TCS did not comment on the report.The attack caused serious problems for M&S. The company was forced to shut down its online store for more than three weeks. This disruption reduced its market value by over 750 million pounds, or about Rs 8,295 crore. It could lead to a loss of up to 300 million pounds, around Rs 3,318 crore, in operating profit. Online services are expected to remain affected until July. UK police are also investigating the incident, the FT report said.&S CEO Stuart Machin stated that the problem was caused by human error, not a flaw in their systems or cyber defences. He mentioned that staff at a third-party contractor were tricked. He did not disclose if a ransom was paid or if TCS, which employs more than 6 lakh people, was the entry point.M&S began working with TCS in the early 2010s. In 2018, the retailer moved half of its tech work to TCS, designating it as its main tech partner. In 2023, they expanded their partnership to update all of M&S's tech systems. During the attack, at least two TCS employees' M&S login details were used in the breach. This attack is the latest to be linked to India's IT industry, increasing concerns about risks from outsourcing IT work to third parties.M&S is a key store on the UK high street and is trying to attract younger shoppers worldwide. It announced plans to strengthen its business and focus on good quality products. In India, M&S works with Reliance Retail. India is its biggest market outside the UK, with over 100 stores opened in the last 15 years. At M&S Reliance, a 51:49 joint venture between M&S and Reliance Retail, sales rose by 5% in FY24, reaching Rs 1,742 crore.","Tata Group's flagship software services company, TCS, is investigating whether it was the entry point for a cyberattack on UK retailer Marks and Spencer.

Trump LIVE PRESSER DERAILED By Fiery 'Congressmen'? Harvard Flashpoint Erupts Live

In a fresh attack on overseas manufacturing, US President Donald Trump has warned Apple that iPhones not made in the United States could face a 25% tariff, and other smartphone makers like Samsung may not be spared either.Speaking on Truth Social and later to reporters at the White House, Trump said he expects Apple and its CEO Tim Cook to move production from countries like India back to the United States. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone ’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” he posted Friday. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.”He added in person, “It would be more. It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product. Otherwise it wouldn’t be fair.”Trump’s comments follow reports that Apple is planning to produce most of its US-sold iPhones in India. Cook had told investors during an earnings call earlier this month that “the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin.”The warning comes after Trump met Cook in Riyadh last week and again at the White House on Tuesday.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook,” Trump said during a stop in Qatar. “I said to him, ‘Tim, you’re my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming in with $500 billion.’ But now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.”The move could have serious consequences for Apple and US consumers. Analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities said it would cost the company roughly $30 billion and up to 10 years to fully move iPhone production to America. “The concept of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,” Ives said. He added that the cost of US-made iPhones could reach $3,500 if Apple replicated its Asian supply chain locally.Gene Munster from Deepwater Asset Management said Apple may not be able to absorb the cost of tariffs forever. “Anything below 30, they will probably carry the vast majority of that increase,” he explained. “But I think at some point they’re going to have to start to share it.”Apple has announced a $500 billion US investment plan to ease tensions, which includes building server facilities in Houston and expanding data centres in 20 states.Despite Apple’s efforts, Trump appears firm. “When they build their plant here, there’s no tariffs. So they’re going to be building plants here,” he said.Samsung, which mostly manufactures in South Korea, Vietnam, India, and Brazil, could also be hit. Although it moved out of China years ago, Trump insisted that all non-US phone production would face the same treatment. “It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” he said.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent supported Trump’s call, saying the goal is to “bring back precision manufacturing to the US.” He also flagged concerns about the security of Apple’s semiconductor supply chain.",US President Donald Trump has warned Apple that iPhones not made in the United States could face a 25% tariff.

RBI's record Rs 2.7 trillion dividend fueled by US dollar sell offs and forex gains: SBI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbis-record-rs-2-7-trillion-dividend-fueled-by-us-dollar-sell-offs-and-forex-gains-sbi/articleshow/121372926.cms,"The Reserve Bank of India’s historic dividend payout of approximately Rs 2.7 trillion to the government was fueled by strong sales of US dollar, a high foreign exchange gain and steady rise in interest income, State Bank of India said in its latest report.The report said that RBI’s active participation in the forex market was a major contributor to this huge surplus. In fact, the central bank emerged as the biggest seller of foreign exchange reserves among Asian peers in January 2025.“This surplus payout is driven by robust gross dollar sales, higher foreign exchange gains, and steady increases in interest income,” the report noted, quoted by ANI.Over the past year, the apex bank adopted a series of aggressive measures, including large scale sell offs of US dollars, as a part of its intervention strategy to stabilise Rupee. India’s forex reserves had peaked at $704 billion in September 2024. After this, the RBI began offloading large amounts of dollars to prevent excessive volatility in the currency markets.The gross dollar sales reached a whopping $371.6 billion by February 2025, amounting well over double the $153 billion recorded during FY24. These drastic interventions helped the central bank book in substantial forex gains, contributing significantly to the dividend payout.Alongside foreign exchange gains, the RBI also saw increased earnings from its holdings in rupee securities, which rose by Rs 1.95 lakh crore to Rs 15.6 lakh crore as of March 2025.While falling government securities (G-sec) yields dampened mark-to-market (MTM) gains, overall interest income still recorded a healthy growth.The SBI report praised the central bank’s prudent approach to maintaining financial stability. It further added that the surplus transfer could have soared even higher, possibly crossing Rs 3.5 trillion, had the central bank not decided to raise its risk buffer.The Contingent Risk Buffer (CRB), a safety net for unforeseen shocks, was kept within the 5.5 to 6.5 per cent range of the RBI’s balance sheet in line with recommendations from the central board. The surplus was calculated under the revised Economic Capital Framework (ECF) and approved by the RBI’s Central Board during a meeting held on 15 May 2025.This unexpected windfall comes as a major boost to the government’s finances. The Union Budget for 2025–26 had projected a total dividend income of Rs 2.56 lakh crore from the RBI and state-run financial institutions. With the latest payout, the actual figure will now comfortably exceed budget estimates.","The Reserve Bank of India’s historic dividend payout of approximately Rs 2.7 trillion to the government was fueled by strong sales of US dollar, a high foreign exchange gain and steady rise in interest income.

RBI's new KYC rules to ease compliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbis-new-kyc-rules-to-ease-compliance/articleshow/121371523.cms,"MUMBAI: The RBI has proposed changes to its master direction on 'know your customer' norms-rules aimed at preventing money laundering-that will ease compliance for millions of bank customers, particularly low-risk individuals and beneficiaries of govt schemes.The draft circular outlines relaxed procedures for periodic KYC updates, responding to concerns over delays and customer complaints.The proposed rules mark a shift from rigid timelines towards a more flexible system while maintaining safeguards against money laundering and terrorist financing. For low-risk customers, the RBI extended the KYC update deadline to one year from the due date or until June 30, 2026, whichever is later.During this period, transactions will continue, though the accounts will remain under regular monitoring. This move brings relief as earlier banks froze accounts that did not comply with re-KYC requirements. To address large backlogs and improve customer service, the RBI directed banks to improve communication. Before the due date, regulated entities must send at least three alerts, including one by letter. After the due date, another three reminders are required, again with at least one letter.","The draft circular outlines relaxed procedures for periodic KYC updates. The proposed rules mark a shift from rigid timelines towards a more flexible system.

"How RBI earns profit, decides dividend: Explained",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-rbi-earns-profit-decides-dividend-explained/articleshow/121371477.cms,"Is the Reserve Bank of India supposed to make profits?

If the objective is public good, how does profit emerge as a byproduct?

Can RBI control the level of profits?

Do other central banks distribute profits?

How does RBI decide how much profits to distribute and how much to retain?

Why are bond markets rallying because of an expected high dividend?

What is the reason behind record dividend?

RBI's main job is not to make profits but to keep the economy stable. Its goal is to make sure that prices of everyday items don't rise too fast, and that borrowing rates and exchange rates stay steady without wild swings, while still reflecting demand and supply. It also prints money, manages the country's foreign currency reserves, and handles banking for govt. Some of these activities may earn it extra money, but this surplus is handed over to the govt.RBI's goal is public good, not profit, but some of its actions in financial markets - done to maintain stability - can generate income. It holds dollars as a safeguard, and when it sells them during currency volatility, it may profit if the rupee has weakened. It also lends to banks at market rates to manage liquidity and inflation, earning interest in the process. Even printing currency brings income - called seigniorage-since notes cost less to produce than their face value. These operations happen at market rates to avoid distortions and keep the system stable and fair.RBI operates in a ""Goldilocks zone,"" allowing markets to function freely, while stepping in to curb volatility.Interventions - like selling dollars or managing liquidity - can lead to profits, depending on timing and market movements. As the economy grows, RBI's balance sheet expands, naturally increasing the scale of its operations and potential income. Profits tend to rise in times of stress in the financial markets, when intervention is high, and fall during stable periods, reflecting its counter-cyclical role.Major central banks like those in the US, China and Japan generate large surpluses, mainly due to size of their balance sheets. As their holdings - such as foreign reserves, govt bonds and loans to banks - increase, so do their interest earnings. The US Fed earns from its vast portfolio of Treasuries, China's central bank profits from managing the world's largest forex reserves, and Japan's from its extensive bond holdings. However, the shareholders include banks and they also get a share of the profits. These surpluses are not intentional profits but arise from large-scale operations, and are usually transferred to their respective govts, much like RBI does.The Bimal Jalan Committee (2018-19) set a framework for RBI's surplus distribution, aiming to balance financial stability with fiscal support. It classified economic capital into realised equity (Contingent Risk Buffer/CRB) and volatile revaluation balances. The CRB was set at 5.5-6.5% of the balance sheet, with surplus transfers allowed only if realised equity exceeds this range. Total economic capital was revised to 20.8-25.4%, down from 28.1-29.1%. The entire net income can be transferred only if the CRB threshold is met. Otherwise, risk provisioning takes priority. Reviewed every five years, this framework enabled a record Rs. 2.1 lakh crore transfer in 2023-24 by maintaining the CRB at 5.5%.The record revenues through dividend and GST have led markets to believe that there will be a sharp drop in govt borrowing. When govt borrows less, there is more money left for corporate borrowers and interest rates dip. When interest rates dip, existing bonds that offer higher rates get sold at a premium.RBI will transfer a record Rs 2.7 lakh crore to govt as dividend this year, higher than last year's Rs 2.1 lakh crore and more than budgeted estimate. This extra money comes mainly from higher earnings through foreign exchange sales, returns on overseas assets, and liquidity operations. The surplus is likely much higher, however RBI may have chosen to retain a large share of the surplus, given that it has decided to increase the level of contingency risk buffer to 7.5%.","RBI's main job is not to make profits but to keep the economy stable.

"RBI to transfer Rs 2.7 lakh crore as dividend to govt, a record",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-to-transfer-rs-2-7-lakh-crore-as-dividend-to-govt-a-record/articleshow/121369601.cms,"MUMBAI: The RBI will transfer a record Rs 2.7 lakh crore to the govt as a dividend for the current financial year, exceeding last year's Rs 2.1 lakh crore and the budget estimate. The dividend outflow surpasses the Rs 2.6 lakh crore the govt projected to receive from the RBI, state-run banks, and financial institutions put together for FY26. The increase in the contingency buffer reflects a more cautious approach by the central bank amid global uncertainty and domestic financial stability concerns.The higher-than-expected payout will help bring down rates, with analysts expecting the yield on government bonds to come down further. The actual profit may have been higher, as the RBI raised its contingency risk buffer to 7.5% from 6.5% a year ago, requiring it to retain a larger share of earnings. Higher income from foreign exchange sales, improved returns on overseas assets, and gains from liquidity operations underpinned the surplus. These factors contributed to the transfer, despite the RBI choosing to hold back a portion of its earnings.Also read: How RBI earns profit, decides dividend: Explained According to Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA, the RBI's dividend exceeds budget assumptions by around Rs 40,000 crore to Rs 50,000 crore, or 11-14 basis points of GDP.This offers a cushion for the govt to absorb lower-than-expected tax or disinvestment receipts, or to manage additional spending. Nayar said the revised nominal GDP figure for FY25 suggests that even with a lower expected growth of 9% in FY26-compared with the budgeted 10.1%-the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio can still be held at 4.4%. This allows for a slippage of around Rs 30,000 crore without breaching the target.Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, said the payout is larger than anticipated and could provide the govt with Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore in extra resources.He said the amount may offset possible shortfalls in customs duties due to reduced tariffs, weaker tax inflows from slower nominal GDP growth, or unexpected defence expenditure.While the higher dividend offers near-term fiscal relief, Sabnavis noted that it may not be repeated annually. Although the RBI has raised its contingency buffer to 4.5-7.5% to manage risks in an uncertain environment, such high transfers may not be sustainable every year.Future dividends will depend on market conditions and how much the RBI sets aside as reserves.","The higher-than-expected payout will help bring down rates, with analysts expecting the yield on government bonds to come down further.

A rise in global risk appetite also supported the local currency, despite lingering pressure from crude oil prices and foreign fund outflows.The rupee, which had dropped 53 paise over the previous three sessions, witnessed heavy volatility in the interbank foreign exchange market. It opened at Rs 85.95 and swung between an intraday high of Rs 85.11 and a low of Rs 86.10, before settling at 85.45—marking a significant recovery from Thursday's close of Rs 85.95.Forex analysts attributed the rebound primarily to a broad-based weakness in the greenback. ""We expect the rupee to trade with a positive bias on underlying weakness in the US dollar index and improved global risk sentiments.

The drop was linked to a resurgence in demand for riskier currencies and declining US Treasury yields.Dilip Parmar, Senior Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, noted that the rupee posted its largest single-day gain since November 11, 2022. “This upward movement was primarily fuelled by a weaker US dollar and a strong performance in the domestic equity market. Additionally, the central bank's efforts to encourage foreign investment in corporate bonds, providing short-duration liquidity, further bolstered the rupee's appreciation,” he said.

IPO boom fuels record exits

A sign of market maturity

India Inc expands abroad

Portfolio flows outpace FDI

India witnessed a sharp 96.5 per cent drop in net foreign direct investment (FDI) in FY25, with investors cashing out of high-profile IPOs and companies ramping up investments overseas. According to data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday, net FDI fell to just $353 million, the lowest on record, from $10 billion in the previous fiscal year.The central bank attributed the sharp decline to rising outward FDI and large-scale repatriation of capital by overseas investors. ""Net FDI moderated, reflecting the rise in net outward FDI and repatriation FDI,"" the RBI said in its monthly bulletin.While gross FDI inflows rose 13.7 per cent to $81 billion in FY25, a spike in exits, particularly from long-term investors through mega IPOs, significantly eroded the net figure. Foreign investors pulled out $49 billion during the year, up from $41 billion in FY24.The steep fall in net FDI came as India's capital markets delivered strong returns, encouraging investors to lock in gains. Private equity and venture capital funds, including Alpha Wave Global and Partners Group, booked multi-billion-dollar exits in companies like Swiggy and Vishal Mega Mart.According to a report by the Indian Venture Capital and Alternate Capital Association (IVCA) and EY, PE/VC exits totalled $26.7 billion in FY25, a 7 per cent increase from the previous year.The report noted that open market exits and PE-backed IPOs gained significant traction amid soaring valuations and bullish investor sentiment.One of the most prominent IPOs was that of Hyundai Motor India, which raised Rs 27,870 crore as the parent company reduced its stake from 100 per cent to 82.5 per cent, repatriating the proceeds. A key foreign investor in Swiggy also realised over $2 billion from its share sale. Telecom major Singtel sold part of its holding in Airtel, and British American Tobacco (BAT) exited a stake in ITC, contributing to repatriation figures.India's benchmark stock indices hit record highs in late September 2024, triggering a wave of IPOs and providing a fertile exit environment for early-stage and institutional investors.Analysts view the trend not as a weakness but as evidence of a more evolved investment ecosystem. ""The ability to attract, retain, and smoothly exit capital reflects positively on the maturity of Indian markets,"" the IVCA-EY report said.The RBI also noted that while net FDI dropped, gross FDI remained concentrated in core sectors like manufacturing, financial services, energy, and communications, which accounted for more than 60 per cent of total inflows.In a parallel trend, Indian firms continued to invest heavily overseas. Outward direct investments surged to $29 billion in FY25 from $17 billion in FY24, reflecting corporate India's growing global ambitions amid a realignment of global supply chains.""Indian companies are increasingly looking outward to tap global markets, build scale, and diversify supply bases,"" said an economist tracking the trend.Adding to the shift in capital dynamics, net portfolio investments, considered more volatile, stood at $2.67 billion in FY25, more than six times the net FDI figure. The RBI noted that this marked a rare instance where traditionally 'stable' FDI was outpaced by 'hot money' portfolio flows.","Net FDI fell to just $353 million, the lowest on record, from $10 billion in the previous fiscal year.

MUMBAI/PUNE: Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday said the Pimpri Chinchwad police's ongoing investigation would establish whether Vaishnavi Hagawane (24), the daughter-in-law of expelled NCP functionary Rajendra Hagawane, was murdered or died by suicide.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, also the NCP chief, announced at a function in Baramati that he had expelled Hagawane from the party and told the police to take strictest action against the latter. He also spoke to Vaishnavi's father over the phone and assured the latter that whoever was responsible for his daughter's death would not be spared.The Pimpri Chinchwad police ensured on Thursday on chief minister Fadnavis' intervention that the custody of Vaishnavi's nine-month-old son was with her parents, residents of the Wakad area.Vaishnavi was found hanging from a ceiling fan in her marital home in Bhukum on May 16. Based on her father Anil Kaspate's complaint, the Bavdhan police arrested her husband, Shashank, mother-in-law, Lata, and sister-in-law, Karishma Hagawane, for offences under sections 80 (dowry death), 108 (abetment of suicide), 352 (intentional insult), 351(criminal intimidation), 3 (5) [common intention] of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Her father-in-law, Rajendra, and elder brother-in-law, Sushil, are on the run.Postmortem report confirmed injury marks on her body, propmting speculations as to whether Vaishnavi died by suicide or was murdered.Fadnavis told reporters in Mumbai, ""It is an unfortunate incident and a black mark on humanity. The arrested suspects were trying to keep the baby with them. I personally told the Commissioner of Police (CP), Pimpri Chinchwad, that the police must intervene and ensure the baby's safety. The police intervened and the baby is now with Vaishnavi's father,"" he said.Regarding Vaishnavi's parents' allegation that she was murdered, Fadnavis said the incident would be investigated as a murder. ""The audio clips, her family's statement, everything will be looked into during the investigation,"" he said.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has been drawing criticism because Hagawane was his party's office-bearer. He had attended Vaishnavi and Shashank's wedding. A photo of him presenting an SUV's key to the young couple at the insistence of Rajendra Hagawane got widely circulated on social media.Ajit Pawar said in Baramati that he had attended the wedding on invitation but if something went wrong thereafter and the family did something wrong to the daughter-in-law then how could that be held against him.He said he did give the key to an SUV to the newly-wed couple at the insistence of Rajendra Hagawane, but had asked the latter specifically if it was being forcibly taken or being gifted at free will.The deputy chief minister said he had asked the Pimpri Chinchwad police to take strongest action in the matter as the husband, sister- and mother-in-law are already under arrest, but Rajendra Hagawane and another family member are on the run.""For how many days will he remain on the run. I have been told that three teams have been formed to arrest Rajendra. I told the officials to form six teams but ensure that he is arrested soon. Also, I declare his immediate dismissal from NCP,"" Ajit Pawar said.He told Vaishnavi's father during their telephonic conversation, ""I am with you. Had you given me any idea about the problems being faced by your daughter earlier, I would have intervened then only. You know that I have absolutely no connection to this incident. Still, my name is being dragged into this. After learning about Vaishnavi's death, I spoke with the Pimpri Chinchwad CP. I told the police to see that Vaishnavi's child was handed over to her parents. ""Vaishanvi's father, Anil Kaspaté, told Ajit Pawar, ""Dada, you had once asked if the Hagawane family had asked for the SUV, and I had replied that I gave it willingly. I gave them the vehicle and other things out of love.""Earlier in the day, the Kaspate family had alleged that Shashank's friend had threatened them at gunpoint and forced them to leave his place when they had gone there to secure custody of Vaishnavi's son. A neighbour had reported to the Kaspates that he had heard the cries of a baby from Shashank's friend's house. In the afternoon, the Kaspates said they got a call from an unknown person. He told them that the baby was in his possession and they could take the baby from a spot on Bavdhan highway.Inspector Bhaskar Kadam of the Bavdhan police said, ""Someone handed over the baby to grandparents in Baner.""A senior officer of the Pimpri Chinchwad police said, ""We are searching for the arrested husband's friend and are also verifying the allegations of threat at gunpoint. We will take action based on the outcome of this process.""Pimpri Chinchwad CP Vinoy Kumar Choubey told TOI, ""We have arrested the main suspect Shashank Hagawane, his mother and his sister. We have put five teams on the job, including three from the crime branch, to trace and arrest Rajendra and Sushil Hagawane.""Vaishnavi's elder sister-in-law, Mayuri Sushil Hagawane, living separately from the Hagawane family since Jan this year, told reporters that she too was subjected to physical and mental torture by the family. ""Vaishnavi's husband, Shashank, and his sister, Karishma, would even beat her, while their parents would taunt her and demand more money from her family,"" she said.Mayuri told the reporters that she had filed a complaint against her in-laws with the Paud police in Nov last year. After two days, her sister-in-law, Karishma, lodged a cross-complaint against her and her husband, she said.Inspector Santosh Girigosavi of the Paud police said, ‘We had registered cross-complaints in Nov last year and issued notices to both parties.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 25% tariff on Apple products unless iPhones are made in America, a move that will likely impact the company's production plans in India. Trump also said he would impose a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union.The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump's ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing.Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major US companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs.""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's (sic) that will be sold in the US will be manufactured and built in the US, not India, or any place else,"" Trump wrote. ""If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US."" The statement suggests Apple itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes.","US President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 25% tariff on Apple products unless iPhones are made in America.

'India Can Take Care...': Trump Scolds Apple's Tim Cook For Making iPhones In 'High Tariff' Nation

Trump declares 50% tariff on EU



Trump threat shakes European markets, Apple shares fall

US President Donald Trump issued a fresh warning to Apple on Friday, saying the company should face a 25% tariff if it manufactures iPhones in ""India or anyplace else."" Trump asserted that he had already informed Apple CEO Tim Cook that he expects iPhones sold in the US to be made in America.Trump took to his Truth Social platform, directly addressing the Apple CEO claiming that, ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else.""""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US Thank your for your attention to this matter!"" he added.The remarks come at a time when Apple is aggressively expanding its manufacturing footprint in India. The company, along with its key suppliers, has been shifting production out of China, a move accelerated by pandemic-related disruptions and ongoing geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing.During a previous state visit to Qatar, Trump recounted a conversation with Cook in which he criticised Apple's increasing investment in India.Trump said, ""I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. I said to him, 'my friend, I treated you very good. You're coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you're building all over India.""""I don't want you building in India. India can take care of themselves,"" Trump reportedly told Cook on May 15.Trump was referring to Apple’s earlier pledge to invest $500 billion in the United States, announced in February.During the technology firm's first-quarter earnings announcement in early May, Cook stated that ""a majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin"".Apple has increased its production in India, aiming to manufacture approximately 25% of global iPhones in the country within the next few years, whilst reducing its dependence on China, where about 90% of its flagship smartphones are currently assembled.The company produced roughly $22 billion worth of iPhones in India in the year ending March 2025, showing a 60% rise from the previous year.At present, India manufactures one in five iPhones globally, demonstrating the company's efforts to distribute production beyond China amidst ongoing trade disputes.Trump also said that his administration would impose a 50 per cent tariff on the European Union as trade talks were ""going nowhere"".Miffed at Washington's current trade deficit with the European Union, Trump said the Bloc was formed ""for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States "".""Their powerful Trade Barriers, Vat Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies, and more, have led to a Trade Deficit with the US of more than $250,000,000 a year, a number which is totally unacceptable,"" he posted on Truth Social.""Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he added.Stock markets in both the US and Europe experienced significant declines early Friday following his social media announcements regarding tariffs targeting Apple and the EU.Prior to market opening, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures decreased by 1.5%, whilst Nasdaq futures fell 1.7%. Both oil prices and Treasury yields experienced downward movements.European markets dropped sharply following Trump's post on Truth Social.

Equities mostly climbed on Friday, bouncing back from the previous day’s sell-off triggered by rising US Treasury yields. The recovery came as yields pulled back slightly and optimism grew following the House passage of President Donald Trump’s expansive tax-cutting budget.Market anxiety had been stirred earlier in the week after Moody’s stripped the US of its top-tier credit rating, citing concerns over soaring deficits. These fears intensified following a weak 20-year Treasury auction on Wednesday, which spooked investors already reeling from Trump’s recent tariff measures, news agency AFP reported.Sentiment steadied Thursday after the Republican-controlled House narrowly approved the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” which extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for a decade. The plan, which trims social programs to offset costs, now moves to the Senate. Fiscal conservatives remain wary, as independent analyses predict the bill could widen the deficit by up to $4 trillion over ten years.The White House argues the legislation will stimulate economic growth to 5.2%, claiming the growth would neutralize the bill’s impact on the national debt, which stands at $36 trillion. These projections, however, remain outside mainstream economic consensus.“Perhaps the fiscal worries have gone a bit too far,” said Chris Weston of Pepperstone. “The bill appears to be more neutral than overly stimulative and may not lead to the massive deficit surge predicted for 2026 and 2027.”Treasury yields eased amid stronger-than-expected US data on jobs, housing, and factory output, helping stabilize equities. Wall Street's mixed close gave way to modest gains across Asia, including Tokyo, Hong Kong, Sydney, Mumbai, Bangkok, Manila, and Jakarta, while Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, and Wellington lagged.Investor sentiment was also buoyed by remarks from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, who suggested interest rate cuts could follow if Trump’s tariffs are reduced to 10% by July.“If we can get the tariffs down closer to 10 percent and that’s all sealed, done and delivered somewhere by July, then we’re in good shape for the second half of the year,” Waller told Fox Business.Meanwhile, the dollar fell against the yen after Japanese inflation rose more than expected, driven by surging food prices—particularly rice. The figure could influence the Bank of Japan’s upcoming policy decisions following recent rate hikes.In the crypto sector, Bitcoin continued its upward march, hitting a new record of $111,980.33 amid optimism for upcoming regulation on stable coins, raising hopes for broader regulatory clarity.","Tokyo - Nikkei 225: up 0.5% at 37,160.47 (close) Shanghai - Composite: down 0.9% at 3,348.37 ( close) London - FTSE 100: up0.4% at 8,771.35 (close), Dollar/yen: down at 143.34 from 143.99; Euro/dollar: up at $1.1335 from $ 1.1281.

Jakob Stausholm, the CEO of mining giant Rio Tinto, will step down later this year, the company announced on Thursday, marking a surprise move. Stausholm, who led the company through a period of significant cultural and strategic transformation, will remain in his role until a successor is named.Rio Tinto did not specify the reason for Stausholm's departure, saying only that the succession process is already underway and this was deemed ""a natural moment"" for leadership change. Analysts, however, expressed surprise at the timing and lack of a clear rationale.""This news comes as a big surprise, and in our view was not expected,"" said Richard Hatch , an analyst at Berenberg. ""It does not feel that natural to us.""Stausholm took the helm in late 2020 following the destruction of the Juukan Gorge Aboriginal heritage site in Western Australia, an incident that triggered widespread condemnation and led to the resignation of his predecessor. One of his first major actions as CEO was to commission a comprehensive review of the company's workplace culture, which exposed systemic issues, including racism, bullying and harassment.Under his leadership, Rio Tinto committed to improving its environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and pivoted toward future-facing minerals, most notably lithium. The company has made several strategic investments in battery metal, including the Rincon project in Argentina, a $6.7 billion acquisition of US-based Arcadium Lithium, and a $900 million investment in the Maricunga lithium project in Chile through a partnership with Codelco.""We had expected Mr Stausholm to remain with the company and drive the integration of the lithium business, so his exit comes as a surprise,"" Hatch added.The company has yet to name a successor, but internal candidates reportedly include chief commercial officer Bold Baatar, head of iron ore Simon Trott, and aluminium division head Jerome Pecresse.

China Accuses US of Undermining Trade Talks With Huawei Curbs

The technology standoff between the United States and China is entering a new phase, with the Trump administration sharpening its focus on cutting-edge chips that power artificial intelligence (AI). At the centre of this evolving conflict is Huawei, the Chinese tech giant whose advanced semiconductors have come under renewed US scrutiny.On May 12, the US commerce department announced it would roll back the ""AI Diffusion Rule"", a regulation introduced under former President Joe Biden to limit China’s access to high end AI chips.Originally set to take effect on May 15, the rule outlined a three-tier system that would have allowed trusted nations to import advanced semiconductors while restricting or banning their export to countries like China.The commerce department said the regulation would have stifled American innovation and strained diplomatic relations with key global partners.The same announcement served as a warning to companies: any use of Huawei’s Ascend chips which is among the most powerful in China’s arsenal and could violate US export laws. The department cautioned that deploying American-made AI chips to train Chinese AI models could trigger “potential consequences.”“This is about refocusing the firepower of AI restrictions directly on Beijing,” Lizzi Lee, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute told AFP. Other analysts echoed this same view; Manoj Harjani of Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies noted that the revised strategy places the spotlight squarely on Huawei and the Chinese tech sector. “This is a marked shift from Biden’s multilateral, alliance-driven approach,” he said.China has already made impressive strides in AI development, with homegrown startup DeepSeek shaking up the technology sector this year with a chatbot that seemingly matches the performance of US competitors at much lower cost.Chinese firms like Alibaba and Xiaomi have announced huge investments in AI in what experts say feeds into a national goal to cut reliance on foreign suppliers.The AI rivalry is playing into broader trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.The two sides traded tit-for-tat tariff hikes after Trump took power, but this month dramatically slashed levies on each other's goods for 90 days, signalling a detente for now.Beijing has condemned the US actions, accusing Washington of “bullying” and using export controls to “suppress and contain” Chinese innovation. Analysts say such rhetoric signals China’s unwillingness to back down.Despite these restrictions, China is pushing ahead with its AI ambitions. This year, Chinese startup DeepSeek drew international attention with a chatbot that reportedly rivals American products at a fraction of the cost. Tech giants like Alibaba and Xiaomi have also pledged major investments in AI, reflecting a broader push to reduce dependence on foreign technology.The intensifying AI rivalry comes amid broader trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. While the two sides recently agreed to temporarily ease tariffs for 90 days, suggesting a brief pause in hostilities, analysts say the tech battle is becoming entrenched.Lizzi Lee cautioned that unlike tariffs, which can be adjusted quickly, technology restrictions are becoming a core part of national security strategies. “The trade truce won’t stop the momentum of tech decoupling,” she said. “If the US continues to blacklist major Chinese AI players, it’s unlikely Beijing will make concessions in other areas.”","The US commerce department announced it would roll back the ""AI Diffusion Rule"", a regulation introduced under former President Joe Biden to limit China’s access to high end AI chips.

US stocks ended little changed on Thursday after a volatile session, as easing Treasury yields helped offset early losses triggered by growing concerns over the federal deficit.

Asian stock markets calmed on Friday after a rough day, helped by a drop in US bond yields and hopes for more economic stability. Investors were watching closely after US President Donald Trump 's new tax-cutting budget passed a key vote in the House of Representatives.The bill, called the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts for another 10 years. It also cuts funding to some social programmes, which has caused concern. Experts say the plan could increase the US deficit by up to $4 trillion over the next decade, though the White House argues it will help the economy grow fast enough to cover the costs.US markets were shaken earlier in the week after weak demand for a 20-year government bond sale and credit rating agency Moody's downgraded the country's top credit rating. These events raised fears about the growing US debt, now at $36 trillion.However, US bond yields pulled back after the tax bill passed the House, giving a boost to stocks. Better-than-expected data on jobs, home sales, and factory activity also supported market confidence.In Asia, markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul and Manila all rose. However, Singapore, Jakarta, Taipei, and Wellington struggled to keep up.There was also some optimism from US federal reserve governor Christopher Waller, who said interest rates could be cut later this year if Trump's tariffs on imports are reduced.In Japan, the yen rose slightly against the US dollar after inflation data showed a rise in food prices, especially rice. This puts pressure on the Bank of Japan as it considers what to do next with interest rates.Meanwhile, bitcoin continued to surge, reaching a new record high of $111,980.33.

US home sales dip to 15-year low in April as mortgage rates hover near 7%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-home-sales-dip-to-15-year-low-in-april-as-mortgage-rates-hover-near-7/articleshow/121346094.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Sales of previously owned homes in the US declined for the second month in a row in April, marking the slowest April pace since 2009, as elevated mortgage rates and record prices continued to squeeze out potential buyers.The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported that existing home sales fell 0.5% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million units.Compared to April last year, sales were down 2%, and the figure fell short of economists’ expectations of 4.10 million units, according to FactSet.April’s performance follows a persistent trend of sluggish activity in the US housing market. “The affordability condition is clearly hurting the market, particularly higher mortgage rates,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR, as quoted by news agency AP.Home sales have hovered at roughly 75% of pre-pandemic levels since 2022 when rates started rising from record lows.Prices continue to rise, albeit more slowly. The median home price hit $414,000 last month, up 1.8% from April 2023, the highest for any April on record. This marked the 22nd consecutive month of annual price increases, though the gain was the smallest since July 2023.The average rate on a 30-year mortgage climbed to 6.86% this week, up from 6.81% last week and nearing the year’s high of just over 7%, reported AP.These high borrowing costs are deterring many first-time buyers, even as inventory increases.The number of unsold homes rose to 1.45 million in April, a 20.8% jump from the same month last year and the highest since September 2020. However, this remains below the 2 million homes typical before the pandemic.Buyers who can navigate the tough market, either through savings or cash offers, are still active.First-time buyers accounted for 34% of April’s sales, the highest since July 2020, while cash buyers made up 25% of transactions, down from 28% a year earlier. Investor purchases also dipped to 15% from 16%.The increased supply means homes are sitting on the market longer. Properties typically spent 29 days on the market in April, up from 26 days a year earlier. The unsold inventory equates to a 4.4-month supply, up from 3.5 months in April 2023, but still shy of the 5 to 6 months seen as a balanced market.Economists quoted by AP say mortgage rates are expected to remain volatile through 2024, likely staying within a 6% to 7% range. This instability, driven by Treasury yield movements and broader economic uncertainty, suggests homebuyers may continue facing affordability challenges during the year’s busiest buying season.","Existing home sales fell 0.5% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million units.

When will Trump’s $5 million gold card visa be launched? US Commerce Secretary Lutnick provides big update,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/when-will-trumps-5-million-gold-card-visa-be-launched-us-commerce-secretary-lutnick-provides-big-update/articleshow/121344096.cms,"What is the Gold Card visa scheme?

International investors with at least $5 million in capital will have access to a new ""gold card"" visa programme in about a week, granting permanent residency and work authorization in the United States, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced on Wednesday.Speaking at Axios’ Building the Future event in Washington, DC, Lutnick revealed that the initiative, introduced by President Donald Trump, aims to attract high-net-worth individuals to invest in the country in exchange for a streamlined path to US residency. “I expect there will be a website up called TrumpCard.gov in about a week,” Lutnick said, as reported by CNN. “The details of that will come soon after, but people can start to register,"" he added.While full specifics of the programme will be disclosed in the coming weeks, Lutnick confirmed that it is intended to replace the existing EB-5 Immigrant Investor Programme. Under the current EB-5 scheme, green cards are available to foreign investors who contribute $1.8 million to the US economy—or $900,000 in designated economically distressed areas.The proposed ""gold card"" would require a significantly higher investment of $5 million but would offer expanded privileges, including a route to US citizenship.Trump had first proposed this visa in February earlier this year. “We’re going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million,” he said in an announcement from the Oval Office. “That’s going to give you green card privileges, plus it’s going to be a route to citizenship. And wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card,"" he further stated.Lutnick suggested that interest in the programme is already strong, particularly among high-net-worth individuals abroad. Referring to a recent trip to the Middle East, he said, “Basically, everyone I meet who is not an American is going to want to buy this card- if they have the fiscal capacity.”He also framed the initiative as part of a broader economic strategy, claiming it could help reduce the US federal debt, which currently exceeds $36 trillion. “These are going to be great people who are going to come and bring businesses and opportunity to America, and they’re going to pay $5 million,” he said adding, “If there are 200,000 people who pay, that’s a trillion dollars. That pays for everything.”However, immigration experts have noted that creating a new visa category would require approval from the US Congress, raising questions about the legal and legislative feasibility of the plan.The US Gold Card initiative, priced at $5 million, is proposed as a successor to the existing EB-5 immigrant investor visa scheme.The EB-5 programme, established in 1990, currently enables foreign nationals to secure green cards through business investments. The qualifying criteria include a minimum investment of $1 million in a business venture, or $800,000 in economically disadvantaged regions, with the requirement to create at least 10 jobs.In 2024, authorities granted over 4,500 EB-5 visas. The proposed Gold Card programme, according to Trump's announcement, would operate without any numerical restrictions on issuance.Further details, including eligibility criteria and implementation timelines, are expected to be released by the Commerce Department in the coming weeks.","US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced a new visa programme on Wednesday. The initiative, introduced by President Donald Trump, aims to attract high-net-worth individuals to invest in the country in exchange for a streamlined path to US residency. The proposed ""gold card"" would require a significantly higher investment of $5 million but would offer expanded privileges.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121344083,imgsize-846707,width-400,resizemode-4/121344083.jpg"
Wall Street slips as US bond market worries intensify after House passes Trump tax bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-slips-as-us-bond-market-worries-intensify-after-house-passes-trump-tax-bill/articleshow/121343139.cms,"AI-generated image

NEW YORK: US stocks slipped in early Thursday trading amid growing concerns over rising government debt and surging Treasury yields, following House approval of President Donald Trump ’s sweeping tax cut legislation.The S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent in early trade, putting it on track for its worst week in two months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 101 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 41,829.75 around 9.35 am Eastern time, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2 per cent to 19,535.10.The pullback comes after a turbulent week driven by volatility in the bond market, the epicentre of investor anxiety. Yields on government debt spiked in response to fiscal concerns, with the 10-year US Treasury climbing as high as 4.63 per cent before edging back to 4.59 per cent. The 30-year bond yield also rose, reaching 5.12 per cent. Rising yields reflect investor unease over the US government’s growing debt load and are seen as a headwind for equity valuations and borrowing costs.Swissquote Bank analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya said the spike in yields is “the market’s way of signaling a lack of confidence in the US government and its policy direction.”The tax legislation approved by the House aims to extend around $4.5 trillion in tax cuts from Trump's 2017 plan while introducing additional reductions.However, it also scales back clean energy subsidies and includes cuts to certain social programmes. The bill is expected to undergo substantial revisions in the Senate before potentially reaching the president’s desk.Investors are cautious about the long-term economic implications of the tax bill, particularly its projected impact on the national debt. Higher Treasury yields not only increase borrowing costs for the government but also ripple through the broader economy—raising expenses for households and businesses, and dampening appetite for riskier assets like equities.Sector-specific losses were also notable. Solar energy stocks took a hit following the proposed rollback of production tax credits. Sunrun plunged 40 per cent, Enphase Energy dropped 16.5 per cent, and First Solar fell 4 per cent. Health care shares declined after the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced an immediate expansion of Medicare Advantage audits. UnitedHealth Group fell 1.4 per cent, while Humana slid 3.6 per cent.Global markets mirrored the cautious sentiment. France’s CAC 40 declined 1.1 per cent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.2 per cent, and South Korea’s Kospi also shed 1.2 per cent in one of the day’s sharper losses.","The S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent in early trade, putting it on track for its worst week in two months.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

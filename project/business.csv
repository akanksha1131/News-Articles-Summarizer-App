Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday as the December 2025 futures contract climbed to Rs 1,70,415 per kilogram. This marks an increase of Rs 1,977 or 1.18% for the day.The surge in silver prices has resulted in a remarkable 19.8% gain for the month of October, rising from a closing price of Rs 1,42,145 on September 30. This significant monthly increase highlights strong festive demand and growing industrial interest in the metal.The recent rally has sparked renewed interest in silver's long-term potential, with analysts attributing the uptrend to solid underlying fundamentals. Mahendra Patil, Founder and Managing Partner at MP Financial Advisory Services LLP (MPFASL), noted that silver is experiencing ""a phase of structural endurance rather than speculative exuberance"", as quoted by Economic Times.Patil pointed out that while silver has historically been volatile, its past performance offers valuable insights. The metal previously approached the $50 per ounce mark in 1980 and 2011, and with 2025 marking its third such approach, the focus is now on whether it can maintain sustained momentum.In 2025, silver prices surged from $29 to over $47 per ounce, reaching ""its highest level in more than a decade."" MPFASL attributes this momentum to several factors, including ""higher expectations from US rate cuts, sustained central-bank buying, and industrial restocking across solar and electronics supply chains.""Highlighting silver's dual appeal, Patil said, ""Silver is gaining ground as both a symbolic and practical substitute. Beyond its decorative appeal, the industrial demand linked to solar panels, electronics, and electric mobility provides fundamental support to prices, creating a dual-use demand base that gold lacks.""The rise in silver demand is not limited to global markets. In India, silver imports have increased significantly. ""Silver imports have expanded, reflecting its growing relevance as an industrial and investment metal within the renewable-energy and electronics value chains,"" MPFASL reported.Data from the firm also revealed that silver delivered an annualized return of 32.92% in the CY2023–CY2025 period, with a volatility of 24.66%, based on historical performance. The correlation between gold and silver during this period stood at 0.95, indicating closely linked price movements, although silver's trajectory has increasingly been driven by industrial factors.Looking ahead, MPFASL suggests that silver may continue to benefit from its industrial underpinnings. ""Silver exceeded expectations, crossing $47 per ounce on renewed industrial restocking in solar and electronics,"" the report noted.Most projections indicate that silver is expected to remain in the $44–50 per ounce range through FY2026. While gold may experience consolidation, ""silver amplified the momentum as the cyclical bellwether of a broader industrial revival.""As India enters the festive season and global industrial restocking continues, the metal's trajectory will likely depend on sustained demand from the electronics and renewable sectors. MPFASL adds that silver's ability to surpass the $50 per ounce mark may depend on whether it can ""finally build sustained momentum and move toward the next big landmark, its metaphorical 'century.'""For domestic traders, Rs 1,70,415 now serves as a key resistance level on MCX. With industrial and festive tailwinds in play, attention will remain on whether silver can build upon this rally or consolidate near its current highs.","Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices extended their rally for the third consecutive week driven by strong global cues and encouraging business updates from several companies. Positive start to the Q2FY26 earning sessions also supported by positive momentum. Dovish remarks from the Fed Chair on interest rates and indications of a possible pause in quantitative tightening, which buoyed global risk sentiment. Lower CPI and WPI data in India also boosted rate cut expectations in India.Nifty traded in a range in the first two trading sessions of the week. However, it gained momentum as the week progressed and rallied to three months high on Thursday. Index in the process generated a breakout above a falling supply line joining the major highs of September 2024 and June 2025 signaling strength and continuation of the up move.On the smaller time frame Nifty has generated a breakout above the last three months symmetrical triangular consolidation pattern highlighting positive bias and any dips should be used as a buying opportunity.We expect the index to head towards 25,900 and then towards 26,200 levels in the coming weeks being the 123.6% and 138.2% external retracement of the last three months' corrective decline (25669-24338).On the downside immediate support is placed at 25350-25400 levels being the recent breakout area while key support is placed at 25100-25,000 levels being the current week low and 20- & 50-days EMA.Bank Nifty continues to maintain a bullish structure on the daily chart, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows. The index has also witnessed a breakout from an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern — a strong bullish reversal setup — reinforcing the positive trend.Bank Nifty continues to outperform the Nifty in the current leg of up move, with key private banking heavy weights Q2FY26 results lined up on coming Saturday. It will decide the next directional trigger for the index.With prices holding above key moving averages, the near-term bias remains upward. The index is likely to test our target of 58,000, being the 161.8% external retracement of the previous up move (53561-55835) as projected from the recent trough of 54226. Thursday's gap area of 56,700 will act as immediate support for the index.The RSI (14) at 66 indicates healthy momentum, suggesting strength in the uptrend. Any dips should be viewed as buying opportunities within this constructive setup.Reliance Industries' stock has undergone a corrective phase over the past three months and is currently consolidating near a crucial support zone. This technical setup offers a favorable risk-reward profile, positioning the stock for a potential bullish reversal and the next leg of the uptrend.A key technical takeaway from the weekly chart of Reliance Industries is the time-price relationship, where the stock has taken 13 weeks to retrace merely 50% of the preceding 13-week rally from ₹1115 to ₹1551. This shallow and time-consuming retracement reflects inherent strength and a bullish undertone. The recent corrective phase is interpreted as a higher base formation, setting the stage for the next impulsive leg on the upside.The ongoing corrective phase appears to be nearing exhaustion, with price action indicating the potential for a fresh bullish reversal. We anticipate the stock to resume its primary uptrend and retest the previous swing highs around ₹1540 in the upcoming quarters, which correspond to the key resistance zones marked by the September 2024 and July 2025 peaks.Suzlon stands to be a prime beneficiary of India’s renewable energy expansion, with wind capacity projected to rise from 49.8 GW in 2024 to 127.9 GW by 2033. The company’s leadership in domestic manufacturing and a record firm orderbook of 5.7 GW as of Q1 FY26 provide multi-year revenue visibility and execution certainty. Recent marquee orders from Tata Power Renewable and Sunsure Energy reaffirm Suzlon’s strong demand pipeline, while the steady contribution from its high-margin O&M business adds stability and predictable cash flows to its earnings profile.Further strengthening its strategic position, Suzlon’s acquisition of a 76% stake in Renom Energy Services unlocks access to the large non-Suzlon O&M market, enhancing scale and profitability through cross-selling and synergies. The company’s calibrated capex of ₹400–450 crore, with a strong R&D focus, is set to drive innovation and operating leverage through efficient, export-ready turbine designs. Overall, Suzlon’s integrated model, improving margin mix, and balance of growth and annuity revenues underpin a constructive long-term investment outlook.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 17, 2025 are Reliance Industries, and Suzlon Energy.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price prediction today:Gold continued its strong upward trajectory through the session, reflecting sustained bullish sentiment as momentum indicators aligned firmly in favor of buyers. Prices surged past the crucial pivot zone near ₹1,28,800, maintaining a clear dominance above short-term moving averages. The crossover of the 8 EMA above the 21 EMA reaffirmed trend strength, while price action consistently held above previous day’s pivot points — a sign of confident accumulation through the day.Bollinger Bands have widened on the upper side, signaling a fresh volatility breakout in favor of the bulls. RSI hovered near 77, comfortably placed in the overbought region, underscoring strong momentum yet hinting that some intraday profit booking cannot be ruled out around ₹1,30,100–₹1,30,200 zones. MACD remains in buy mode, with the histogram supporting continued upside traction.On the downside, support is placed near ₹1,29,150, followed by ₹1,28,850, where the lower EMA cluster is likely to cushion any correction.On the higher side, a decisive move above ₹1,30,200 may open the gates for ₹1,30,500–₹1,30,650 levels.Overall, the intraday technical setup stays distinctly bullish. As long as prices hold above ₹1,29,000, traders can look for fresh buying opportunities on dips with a stop loss below ₹1,28,850. The structure reflects a trending market with strong volume participation, hinting that the bulls still have more room to run in the near term.","Just ahead of Dhanteras and Diwali, gold prices are likely to continue their upward trend, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

Jamie Dimon’s View on Gold





Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO, who is long known to be a skeptic on gold investment, has said that he now sees a ‘semi-rational’ in having the yellow metal as part of your investment portfolio.Gold prices have surged significantly, rising from under $2,000 two years ago to remarkable levels, outperforming equity markets in the 21st century. This upward trend reflects investors seeking refuge in secure assets, driven by inflationary pressures and global political tensions.While stating that he is not a buying of gold, Dimon acknowledged that gold prices could go up to as high as $10,000! ""I'm not a gold buyer — it costs 4% to own it,"" Dimon said this week at Fortune's Most Powerful Women conference in Washington.Dimon expressed a measured view on gold ownership whilst acknowledging its potential value in current circumstances.""It could easily go to $5,000, $10,000 in environments like this. This is one of the few times in my life it's semi-rational to have some in your portfolio,” he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.""Asset prices are kind of high,"" Dimon said, and ""in the back of my mind, that cuts across almost everything at this point.""Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of Citadel, expressed concern last week about investors increasingly perceiving gold as a more stable alternative to the dollar, describing this shift as ""really concerning.""Goldman Sachs has adjusted its gold price prediction for December 2026 upwards to $4,900 per ounce, an increase from the previous $4,300, attributing this change to significant Western ETF investments and anticipated central bank purchases.""We see the risks to our upgraded gold price forecast as still skewed to the upside on net, because private sector diversification into the relatively small gold market may boost ETF holdings above our rates-implied estimate,"" Goldman said according to a Reuters report.HSBC has increased its projected average gold price for 2025 to $3,355 per ounce from $3,215, attributing the rise to heightened safe-haven interest amidst global political tensions, financial instability, and declining US dollar strength.""Sentiment remains bullish as rallies are expected to continue in 2026 aided by official sector buying and institutional demand for gold as a diversifier,"" the bank stated in a note dated October 15.HSBC revised its gold price projection upward, setting a new average target of $3,950 for 2026, an increase from its previous estimate of $3,125.ANZ's latest analysis predicts gold prices will reach $4,400 per ounce by end-2025, citing several factors including heightened geopolitical tensions, economic instability, financial market uncertainties, and anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate reductions.The bank expects gold valuations to achieve their highest point around $4,600 per ounce in June 2026, before trending downward in the latter half of 2026, coinciding with the end of the Federal Reserve's easing programme and increased certainty regarding US economic expansion and trade policy directions.","Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO, has said that he now sees a ‘semi- rational’ in having the yellow metal as part of your investment portfolio.

The United States and India recently engaged in fruitful trade discussions, during which it was revealed that Indian refiners are set to reduce their imports of Russian oil by 50%, according to a White House official speaking to Reuters on Thursday.However, Indian sources, cited by Reuters indicated that the reduction has not yet been observed. They suggested that any decrease might become apparent in the import data for December or January. The sources noted that orders for November shipments, which include some cargoes scheduled to arrive in December, have already been placed.Furthermore, the Indian government has not officially requested refiners to decrease Russian oil imports, the sources added.This report comes amid claims from US President Donald Trump that Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him that India will stop buying Russian oil.Also read: Moscow reacts to Trump’s claim on PM Modi stopping Russian oil trade; says ‘our supplies very beneficial for Indian economy’ When asked, earlier this week, whether Trump views India as a reliable partner, Trump said, ""Yeah, sure.

"FAA nod for 737 Max: Two years after door plug incident, Boeing allowed to hike production; max output limit 42 per month",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/faa-nod-for-737-max-two-years-after-door-plug-incident-boeing-allowed-to-hike-production-max-output-limit-42-per-month/articleshow/124651860.cms,"



Boeing on Friday received green light from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to increase monthly production of its 737 Max aircraft, following reviews and inspections.The plane maker can now make 42 jets per month, up from the previous limit of 38. The cap had been introduced after a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines plane in January 2024, sparking renewed concerns about Boeing’s safety standards.Although the FAA set the limit last year, Boeing’s actual production fell below the ceiling for a long stretch. Investigations and a machinists’ strike, which halted work for almost eight weeks, slowed output. By the second quarter of this year, however, Boeing reached the cap and signalled it would ask regulators for permission to produce more.A Boeing spokesperson said the company had followed a “disciplined process” to make sure it was ready to scale up safely, working in line with the guidelines and performance goals that it agreed on with the FAA.“We appreciate the work by our team, our suppliers and the FAA to ensure we are prepared to increase production with safety and quality at the forefront,” Boeing said in a statement cited by AFP.The FAA stressed that its decision does not mean reduced oversight. Inspectors will continue to monitor Boeing’s factories, and their work has carried on even during the US government shutdown that began on October 1.The agency recently restored Boeing’s authority to carry out final safety inspections on 737 Max jets and issue flight certificates, something it was not allowed to do for more than six years.The FAA assumed control of approvals in 2019 after two fatal crashes of the then-new model killed 346 people. Investigators later blamed a software system created by Boeing for the accidents.Boeing’s production plans have also been under political scrutiny. Earlier this year, CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared before a Senate committee, where lawmakers pressed him on whether safety was being prioritised over profit, AFP reported.""Just to be very clear, we won’t ramp up production if the performance isn’t indicating a stable production system,"" Ortberg said during a hearing in April.“We will continue to work on getting to a stable system.”The Alaska Airlines incident was one of several alleged safety breaches at Boeing between September 2023 and February 2024. The FAA is seeking $3.1 million in fines from the company over these violations.","Boeing can now make 42 jets per month, up from the previous limit of 38.

Mumbai: Reliance Industries , India’s largest company in terms of market value, posted a 16% increase in quarterly profit on Friday, driven by strong performance of its legacy oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business and consumer-facing digital and retail units. Revenue totalled over Rs 2.6 lakh crore, up about 10%.Operating profit, a yardstick for underlying business performance, rose 16% to Rs 48,480 crore, reflecting RIL’s “agile business operations, domestic focused portfolio and structural growth in the Indian economy,” said company chairman & MD Mukesh Ambani . Expenses climbed nearly 9% to Rs 2.3 lakh crore.Operating profit of O2C increased 21% to Rs 15,008 crore due to a sharp rebound in transportation fuel cracks and improvement in polymer margins. Earnings were also supported by sustained higher volumes in domestic fuel retailing. Revenue from the O2C business increased 3.2% to Rs 1.6 lakh crore, despite continued volatility in energy markets. “Fuel margins recovered over previous year led by middle distillate cracks. Downstream chemicals continue to be impacted by overcapacity. Corrective steps by the industry stakeholders will help balance global downstream markets in the medium-term,” Ambani said.Operating profit of the digital services business (Jio) surged 17% to Rs 18,882 crore driven by revenue growth and healthy margin improvement. Revenue increased due to subscriber market share gains across mobility & homes and improvement in ARPU. Jio’s average revenue per user — a key metric that influences income — was at Rs 211 in Q2FY26 up by 8%. ARPU is the total revenue of a telecom operator divided by the number of users on its network. Launched in 2016, Jio had 506 million customers as on Sept 30, 2025 and saw data and voice traffic growth of about 30% and 6% on its network, respectively.Operating profit of the retail business shot up 16% to Rs 6,817 crore due to improved efficiencies and sharper product mix. Revenue from the business increased 18% to Rs 90,018 crore led by growth in grocery, fashion & lifestyle, and consumer electronics verticals. Festive buying, new launches and GST rate reductions boosted growth. Reliance Retail had 19,821 outlets as of Sept 30, 2025. Operating profit of the oil & gas business declined 5% to Rs 5,002 crore due to lower revenues and higher operating costs on account of periodic maintenance activities. Revenue was lower by 2.6% because of natural decline in gas production and lower gas price realisation. RIL’s net debt at the end of Q2FY26 was Rs 1.2 lakh crore, and it had Rs 2.29 lakh crore in cash and cash equivalents. The company spent Rs 40,010 crore towards capital expenditure during the quarter.","India’s largest company in terms of market value, posted a 16% increase in quarterly profit.

Mumbai: The sharp rise in prices of gold in the last couple of years has barely dented enthusiasm among buyers of the yellow metal during the ongoing festive season. Across India, in the run up to Dhanteras , while the average size of each transaction of the yellow metal has come down, the rise in prices has, in most cases, led to double-digit-percent rise in average purchase value, jewellers said. There has also been a shift in preference among customers, towards light weight and lower carat pieces, they said.“The rally in gold prices has further strengthened the sentiment, and customers continue to make confident purchases, viewing precious metals as trusted and long-term assets amid all the uncertainties right now,” said Saurabh Gadgil, CMD, PNG Jewellers. Gadgil said since Dussehra there has been steady demand across gold, diamond and silver jewellery.The reduction in income tax rates for individuals from this fiscal and the recent cut in GST rates, could be another reason for the continuing demand for these metals, MP Ahammad, chairman, Malabar Group said.“While the gems & jewellery sector has been excluded from GST reforms, we believe the resulting increase in disposable income will indirectly boost consumer demand,” Ahammad said. There’s some change in consumer behaviour across segments due to higher gold prices.“There has been an increased preference among certain customer segments towards lightweight and lower-carat pieces like 18K or 14K jewellery that offers price flexibility and style. ”In the last two years, the price of gold in the physical market has more than doubled while in the last one year the rise has increased about 65% to close to Rs 1.3 lakh/per 10 grams. There’s also been a rising trend among customers to exchange old gold jewellery for new ones, especially in smaller towns and rural areas. “At above Rs 1 lakh level, gold is mostly out of reach of most people in smaller places.“I’m seeing lots of people exchanging their old gold ornaments and getting new ones,” said Somnath Ghosh, proprietor, S Ghosh Jewellers at Hooghly Ghat, a Kolkata suburb. Silver, however, is witnessing a slightly different situation. There is high demand, but not enough supply, Gadgil of PNG Jewellers said.","In the last two years, the price of gold in the physical market has more than doubled.

Delivering Value

Losing Money

But

Revenues Rising





Mumbai: Quick commerce has changed the way consumers shop with 10-minute deliveries becoming the norm, at least in the metros, and investors pouring big money into the space at high valuations.Young player Zepto, founded by two college dropouts in 2021, saw its valuation soar five times $7 billion from $1.4 billion in just two years even as former rival Dunzo perished.Eternal’s Blinkit, Swiggy’s Instamart and Zepto lead the market for quick deliveries with a combined share of over 90% led by Blinkit while Tata’s BigBasket, Flipkart Minutes and Amazon Now lag with a collective share of 5-7%, said Satish Meena, adviser at Datum Intelligence.Analysts at Morgan Stanley have raised bets on the space — the total addressable market for rapid deliveries is estimated to widen to $57 billion by 2030 against initial projections of $42 billion, they said in a report published earlier this year.Zepto, which just raised $450 million from a clutch of investors led by US pension fund Calpers, is now valued more than older startups such as Oyo and Meesho.Last year, Goldman Sachs ascribed Blinkit an implied valuation of $13 billion compared to $2 billion in March 2023 and higher than that of parent Eternal’s core food delivery business Zomato. UBS, it is understood, had pegged Blinkit’s enterprise value at $15.4 billion in 2024. Blinkit, which has been driving Eternal’s growth, was acquired by the company in a $568-million fire sale in 2022.Blinkit leads the quick commerce market with a close to 50% share. Swiggy accounts for around a quarter of the pie, with Zepto close on its heels with a share of 20-23%, analysts said. “Blinkit’s execution is superior. All the high-paying households are with them,” said Meena. In a Jan report, Bernstein estimated Instamart’s valuation at $6.8 billion, nearly the same as food delivery.Although quick commerce businesses are losing money, revenues have surged with more consumers taking to rapid deliveries. Blinkit’s adjusted revenue increased to Rs 9,891 crore in the Sept quarter from Rs 1,156 crore a year ago. Year-on-year, its net order value surged 137% to Rs 11,679 crore in Q2, a 10-quarter high, Eternal said in a letter to shareholders.“While absolute losses decreased, the reduction in loss/margin expansion was below our expectations. This was largely driven by our investments to drive higher growth and (net order value) market share opportunistically in the quarter,” said Blinkit, which moved to an inventory-based model that analysts said will only boost its revenues going ahead.Instamart’s adjusted revenue rose to Rs 859 crore in the June quarter from Rs 403 crore a year ago, while the gross order value doubled to Rs 5,655 crore. “Given the rapid growth and massive potential, competitive intensity remains fairly high in general from both Q-comm-only and Q-comm-also players,” Swiggy said. In FY24, Zepto’s revenues more than doubled to Rs 4,498 crore, showed the latest regulatory filings.With quick commerce taking a share from e-commerce players, Flipkart and Amazon have also forayed into the space but are lagging the three big players.","Blinkit, Swiggy’s Instamart and Zepto lead the market for quick deliveries with a combined share of over 90% led by Blinkit.

Diwali rally: Sensex up 2k points in 4 days on foreign fund buying,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/diwali-rally-sensex-up-2k-pts-in-4-days-on-foreign-fund-buying/articleshow/124651983.cms,".





Mumbai: Sensex rallied to a 52-week high on Friday at above the 84,100-point mark in early trades but end-of-the-session profit taking pulled the index down a bit and it closed 485 points up at just below the 84k mark. Since Tuesday, the sensex has risen nearly 2,000 points or 2.3%.On NSE, Nifty gained 178 points to close at 25,324 points, a 52-week high level. Along with Nifty, the banking index rallied to a record all-time high, exchange data showed. According to Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking, the rally in the market was supported by multiple factors — notably, positive foreign fund inflows and a stronger rupee.“Foreign investors continued to be net buyers, encouraged by a benign global interest-rate environment and resilient corporate earnings from leading private banks and consumer-focused majors,” Mishra said.This week, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) net bought stocks worth Rs 1,548 crore, data combined from BSE and NSDL showed. Net FPI inflows stand at Rs 6,480 crore this month, compared to net outflows aggregating Rs 76,619 crore in Sept.Outside of the leading indices and some others, mid- and small-cap stocks witnessed profit taking, with BSE mid-cap index closing 0.4% down and small-cap index 0.5%. As a result, investors were left poorer by a marginal Rs 3,000 crore, with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 466.9 lakh crore, official data showed.Among the sensex constituents, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and Bharti Airtel contributed the most to the index rally, BSE data showed. In contrast, selling in Infosys, Eternal and a few other stocks limited the index’s gains for the day. Of the 30 sensex constituents, 17 closed with gains while 13 closed lower.","Sensex closed 485 points up at just below the 84k mark. Since Tuesday, the sensex has risen nearly 2,000 points or 2.3%.

"India’s gold reserves top $100bn 1st time, share hits 29-year high",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-gold-reserves-top-100bn-1st-time-share-hits-29-yr-high/articleshow/124651908.cms,".





Mumbai: Gold reserves crossed the $100 billion mark for the first time in the week ended Oct 10, driven by a sharp rise in global prices even as the pace of purchases slowed this year. The value of gold holdings rose by $3.6 billion to $102.4 billion, while overall foreign exchange reserves fell by $2.2 billion to $697.8 billion.The share of gold in total reserves climbed to 14.7%, the highest since 1996–97. The increase reflects both valuation gains and steady accumulation over the past decade, with the share nearly doubling from below 7% to almost 15%. For the week under review, foreign currency assets, the largest component of reserves, dropped by $5.6 billion to $572.1 billion. Special drawing rights fell by $130 million to $18.7 billion, and the reserve position with IMF declined by $36 million to $4.6 billion.Gold accumulation has slowed markedly this year. Buying occurred in only four of the first nine months of 2025, compared with near-monthly additions last year. The central bank added just four tonnes between Jan and Sept, sharply lower than 50 tonnes in the same period last year. The value surge in gold holdings is therefore largely attributed to global price appreciation of about 65% this year rather than new purchases.Central banks globally continue to increase their gold holdings to hedge against currency and sovereign debt risks. As of Oct 10, gold holdings stood at roughly 880 tonnes. RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said the gold rally has strengthened reserves, covering 11 months of imports.","The share of gold in total reserves climbed to 14.7%, the highest since 1996–97.

Silver rate today: White metal slips amid festive buying ahead of Dhanteras & Diwali,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-rate-today-white-metal-slips-amid-festive-buying-ahead-of-dhanteras-diwali/articleshow/124643514.cms,"



Silver and gold markets witnessed significant volatility this week, driven by tight supplies, strong investor demand, and festive buying ahead of Dhanteras and Diwali.In India, silver prices saw sharp fluctuations. The white metal rebounded on Thursday, rising Rs 2,000 to Rs 1,84,000 per kg, after touching a lifetime high of Rs 1,85,000 per kilogram on Tuesday. However, silver slipped again on Friday by Rs 7,000 to Rs 1,77,000 per kg (inclusive of all taxes).On the global market, spot silver briefly hit $54.48 per ounce before easing 1.32% to $53.43 per ounce, reflecting a short-term correction after a strong rally.The December 2025 silver contract jumped Rs 2,752, or 1.64%, to a record Rs 1,70,415 per kg, while the March 2026 contract gained Rs 3,274, or 1.93%, to Rs 1,72,350 per kg on the MCX.Gold also surged this week, supported by festival demand and safe-haven buying amid global uncertainty. In Delhi, 24-carat gold of 99.9% purity rose Rs 3,200 to a record Rs 1,34,800 per 10 grams, up from Rs 1,31,600 in the previous session.Similarly, 99.5% purity gold climbed to Rs 1,34,200 per 10 grams from Rs 1,31,000. Traders attributed the sharp rise to heavy purchases by jewellers and retailers preparing for Dhanteras and Diwali.Globally, spot gold eased 0.52% to $4,303.73 per ounce on Friday, after hitting a record $4,379.29 per ounce in the previous session.Analysts said the slight dip in global prices was a short-term correction following a steep rally, but the broader outlook for gold remains “constructive,” supported by expectations of US monetary easing, geopolitical risks, and central bank buying.Overall, the combination of festival demand, supply constraints, and global uncertainties has kept both gold and silver prices highly volatile this week, with investors closely watching market movements ahead of the Diwali festivities.","Silver and gold markets witnessed significant volatility this week, driven by tight supplies, strong investor demand, and festive buying ahead of Dhanteras and Diwali.

US President Donald Trump on Friday reiterated his claim that ""India won’t be buying Russian oil,"" a claim that has since been refuted by New Delhi.Speaking at a joint press briefing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, Trump repeated his stance on India’s energy imports, saying, ""India won’t be buying Russian oil anymore.

Big setback for Roche as SC upholds Natco’s right to launch generic SMA drug,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/big-setback-for-roche-as-sc-upholds-natcos-right-to-launch-generic-sma-drug/articleshow/124639195.cms,"



In a huge setback for Swiss pharma major Roche, the Supreme Court on Friday dismissed its petition challenging a Delhi High Court ruling that cleared the way for Hyderabad-based Natco to launch a generic version of Risdiplam, the only oral medication for spinal muscular atrophy in the country.The SC bench comprising Justices PS Narasimha and AS Chandurkar declined to interfere with the Oct 9 ruling of the division bench, which had reaffirmed public health must take precedence over monopolistic practices and evergreening, sources told TOI.The order, which balances intellectual property rights with public interest, is significant for ensuring access to treatment for a debilitating disease.Natco recently launched generic Risdiplam, a drug to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) at a fraction of the multinational’s price.Roche’s Risdiplam marketed as Evrysdi, the only oral medication for SMA in India, is priced around Rs 6.2 lakh per bottle, taking up the therapy cost to over Rs 1 crore in certain patients. SMA, is a life-threatening, progressive genetic disease, for which medication is to be taken lifelong, the cost makes it unaffordable to most families. As against this, Natco’s generic version costs around Rs 16,000 per bottle, substantially slashing the price by as much as 97%.The company announced last week that it has decided to launch the drug with immediate effect.Roche had filed the case in 2024 after it learnt about Natco’s plans to launch a generic version of the SMA drug.The SC bench expressed reluctance to interfere in the matter, pointing out that the High Court's findings have been concurrent, both at the single bench and division bench levels.However, it urged the Delhi High Court to expedite the suit filed by Roche against Natco.The Oct 9 ruling upheld the single judge’s order of March this year. A single bench of the Delhi High Court in March had denied Roche an injunction against Natco, citing public interest. It said ``In a patent suit, public interest in terms of availability and accessibility of the drug, is a relevant factor to grant or to refuse the injunction. The price under Roche‟s Patient Support Program in India, is also unaffordable’’.Roche holds an Indian patent for Risdiplam valid till May 2035, claiming the molecule is a new chemical entity distinct from earlier patents.As against this, Natco had told the court that Roche is resorting to ``evergreening and unlawful patent term extension’’ in India.The counsels for Natco include Mukul Rohatgi, Kapil Sibal, Gopal Subramaniam, and Sai Deepak, along with law firm, S Majumdar & Co. While Roche was represented by Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Neeraj Kishan Kaul along with the law firm, Anand & Anand.",Supreme Court dismisses Roche's petition challenging a Delhi High Court ruling.

India’s Gold Reserves - Top Facts





Gold’s record rally has helped India’s gold reserves value cross the $100 billion mark for the first time ever. The Reserve Bank of India 's (RBI) latest foreign exchange reserves data reveals that India's gold reserves have exceeded $100 billion for the first time, primarily due to rising global prices, despite a significant reduction in the central bank's acquisitions this year.According to RBI data released on October 10, India’s gold holdings increased by $3.595 billion to reach $102.365 billion, whilst the total foreign exchange reserves decreased by $2.18 billion to $697.784 billion.According to a Reuters report, traders indicate that gold now constitutes 14.7% of India's total foreign exchange reserves, reaching its highest proportion since 1996-97.The proportion of gold within India's foreign exchange reserves has seen a significant rise in the last ten years, climbing from under 7% to approximately 15%. This increase reflects both the RBI's systematic gold acquisition and substantial increases in worldwide gold prices.This development has resulted in the value of India’s gold reserves reaching the $100 billion mark, despite the RBI notably reducing its gold acquisitions this year.According to World Gold Council statistics, the RBI's gold purchases in 2025 were limited to four months out of the first nine months, which differs from 2024 when the central bank bought gold almost every month.The total gold procurement from January through September amounted to merely 4 tonnes - a substantial decrease from the 50 tonnes acquired during the corresponding period in the previous year.As gold prices experience substantial growth, its proportion within India's foreign exchange reserves has shown notable expansion, primarily due to valuation benefits, according to Kavita Chacko, who heads research for India at the World Gold Council.The precious metal has witnessed an impressive increase of approximately 65% in 2025, influenced by a combination of economic factors, institutional behaviour and market sentiment.International central banks persist in building their gold holdings to diversify reserves beyond the US dollar, particularly in response to growing geopolitical uncertainties, sanctions-related challenges and efforts to reduce dollar dependency.",India’s gold holdings increased by $3.595 billion to reach $102.365 billion.

In a remarkable surge ahead of the auspicious occasion of Dhanteras , gold and silver prices have reached unprecedented levels in both domestic and international markets.On Friday, gold December futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) soared by Rs 3,000, marking a 2.2% increase to a new all-time high of Rs 1,30,005 per 10 grams. Similarly, silver December futures climbed to a new peak of Rs 1,67,999 per kilogram.The rally in precious metals is attributed to growing concerns over credit stress at U.S. regional banks, prompting investors to seek safe-haven assets. Gold prices hit a record $4,378 per ounce, although some profit-taking saw prices stabilize. Despite this, gold is on track for a weekly gain of 7.6%, the largest since early 2020. Silver also reached a new high, reflecting the bullish sentiment.On Thursday, both gold and silver closed on a positive note in domestic and international markets. Gold December futures settled at Rs 1,29,852 per 10 grams, up by 2.08%, while silver December futures ended at Rs 1,67,663 per kilogram, gaining 3.36%.The upward momentum continued as gold prices surpassed $4,300 per troy ounce and silver exceeded $53 per troy ounce in international markets. The decline in the dollar index, US 10-year bond yields falling below 4.0%, and a sell-off in cryptocurrency assets have further supported the rise in gold and silver prices.Additionally, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts are fueling the bullish trend.Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research noted that global central banks and ETF investors are increasingly investing in safe-haven assets, supporting the uptrend. He predicts that gold prices could reach $4,890 and silver could test $65 in the longer term. “Global central banks and ETF investors are continuously pumping their money into safe-haven buying and supporting the uptrend. Gold prices could test $4,890 and silver prices could also test $65 in the longer term,” he said as quoted by Economic Times.Today, the US Dollar Index (DXY) was near the 98.19 mark, down by 0.15%.","Gold and silver prices have reached unprecedented levels in both domestic and international markets.

Strategic significance: Vision 2030 and the aviation push









Saudi Arabia’s newest national airline, Riyadh Air, is preparing for a strategic soft launch of its first international route — daily flights between Riyadh and London Heathrow — beginning October 26, 2025. While tickets won’t be publicly available yet, this tightly managed rollout marks a crucial proving phase as the airline gears up for full-scale commercial operations in 2026.Backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Riyadh Air is positioning itself as a future global aviation leader, with this initial route serving not only as a testbed for systems, aircraft, and service procedures, but also as a key milestone in the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 strategy.Riyadh Air’s first operational route will connect King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh with London Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s busiest and most tightly controlled hubs. But these initial flights won’t be open for general ticket sales. Instead, the seats will be available exclusively to Riyadh Air employees, staff at the airline’s owner — Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) — and their families.The reason for this controlled opening is strategic. While the airline secured a pair of coveted Heathrow slots back in June for the Northern Hemisphere winter season, it does not yet have its own aircraft. Riyadh Air’s order with Boeing for 72 Dreamliners — 39 firm orders for the 787-9 model and 33 options — originally targeted first deliveries by December 2024. That schedule has now been pushed back due to production delays, with the first jets now expected in late 2025.To avoid losing the Heathrow slots under the airport’s strict “use it or lose it” rules, Riyadh Air is launching the route using a leased Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Oman Air. The aircraft, named Jamila and registered as HZ-RXX, is currently being used for pilot training, certification flights, and operational trials.Passengers on these early flights will be considered “Launch Members” and will be invited to share detailed feedback on every part of the journey — from booking and boarding to in-flight experience and ground handling. Tickets for these flights will only be available through the airline’s newly unveiled loyalty platform, Sfeer.Speaking at the official announcement, Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas made it clear that this staged approach is a deliberate choice, not a compromise.“If you go big bang on day one and assume everything will work perfectly on the first day, well, the reality is it won’t,” he said. “So we will use that short period to trial everything and make sure the feedback gives us the opportunity to polish every last little detail before I actually sell a ticket to you.”The new Riyadh–London route spans 3,070 miles with a flight time of approximately 7 hours, making Riyadh Air the fourth airline to operate on this corridor.While Saudia currently maintains a strong presence on the route, it is gradually withdrawing from Riyadh-based services to make way for Riyadh Air, which will become the Kingdom's flagship international airline.Though Riyadh Air is just beginning operations, its long-term ambitions are substantial. The airline was officially announced in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and is a cornerstone of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, an economic diversification plan that seeks to position Riyadh as a global business and tourism hub.Riyadh Air plans to serve over 100 destinations worldwide by 2030, supported by a modern, fuel-efficient fleet and a focus on premium service across every touchpoint. The scale of its ambition is reflected in its extensive aircraft order book:Riyadh Air’s expansion plans are backed by a massive and diversified aircraft order portfolio:This strategic mix aims to equip the airline with a modern, fuel-efficient fleet for both regional and long-haul destinations.Following the launch of its first route to London, Riyadh Air’s next confirmed destination will be Dubai International Airport. The Riyadh–Dubai corridor is among the busiest in the region, with more than 30 daily flights at peak times, operated by a mix of low-cost and full-service carriers. This route will also mark Riyadh Air’s first direct competition with Emirates, which currently operates three daily Boeing 777-300ER services on the same sector.In parallel, Riyadh Air has been forming strategic partnerships to expand its global reach, including a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore potential codesharing and loyalty program alignment.Alongside the launch announcement, Riyadh Air introduced Sfeer, a digital-first loyalty program designed to reflect modern user behavior and local cultural values. The name — which means “ambassador” in Arabic and echoes the English word “sphere” — captures the program’s vision of building a connected and collaborative member community.Unlike traditional airline programs that reward individual travel spend, Sfeer promotes engagement, inclusivity, and shared progress. Members can share level points with family and friends, advancing together toward higher tiers — a model the airline says reflects Saudi values of generosity and togetherness.In its early access phase, Sfeer is open to Riyadh Air’s internal community, but it will be expanded in phases. Early registrants, dubbed “Founders,” will gain priority access to ticket sales on upcoming flights and invitations to exclusive events. When fully launched in 2026, the program will include gamified challenges, member leaderboards, and a no-expiry points policy. Additional benefits will include complimentary onboard Wi-Fi and special partner offers.Douglas positioned Sfeer as a loyalty program that goes beyond points.“We’re emphasizing inclusivity and engagement, rather than the individual transactional models of traditional airline loyalty programs,” he said. “We want this to be community-driven and digitally immersive — not just another points system.”Riyadh Air has also unveiled its first premium lounge, the ‘Hafawa Lounge’ — located between Terminals 1 and 2 at King Khalid International Airport.The lounge is positioned as an extension of Riyadh Air’s commitment to providing a luxury experience and serves as part of its overall operational trial period. As the airline ramps up toward full public service, every touchpoint, from lounge to inflight, is being tested and refined.Riyadh Air was established in March 2023 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a central pillar of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 — the national strategy aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing reliance on oil. The airline’s objectives are closely aligned with the broader ambitions of its owner, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which include transforming Riyadh into a global aviation hub, attracting 330 million passengers annually by 2030, and enhancing international connectivity through strategic partnerships.One such partnership includes a memorandum of understanding with Delta Air Lines to explore future code-sharing agreements and potential loyalty program integration. Riyadh Air forms just one part of the PIF’s expansive investments in the aviation ecosystem, which also span airports, logistics, and supporting infrastructure across the Kingdom.","Riyadh Air will launch its first London flights on October 26 using a leased Boeing 787-9 for staff only.

"US chamber of commerce sues Trump administration over $100,000 H-1B fee",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-chamber-of-commerce-sues-trump-administration-over-100000-h-1b-fee/articleshow/124627901.cms,"File photo

TOI correspondent from Washington:

‘Not An Annual Fee’: White House Issues Clarification Amid Confusion Over H-1B Visa Fee Order





Corporate America, for long pally with Republican dispensations in Washington, is suing the Trump administration over the $100,000 annual fee for H1B visa, saying the astronomical hike in charges is misguided, unlawful, and detrimental to US businesses.In a federal lawsuit filed before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, which counts giants like Microsoft, WalMart, Exxon Mobil, Amazon, and Pfizer among its members, said the Trump administration has exceeded its statutory authority in announcing the new fee and sought an immediate injunction to block the policy's enforcement.The lawsuit targets a presidential proclamation issued last month, titled ""Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,"" which fundamentally re-engineers the financial structure of the H-1B program. Under the new rule, new H-1B visa petitions, primarily for foreign workers outside the US (about 70 percent of whom come from India), must be accompanied or supplemented by a $100,000 payment.Arguing that the new fee blatantly contravenes the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) which governs the H-1B program, the lawsuit contends that a $100,000 tab countermands Congress's judgment that the program should provide a pathway for up to 85,000 people annually to contribute their talents to the United States.By unilaterally imposing such an extreme financial barrier, the Chamber argues that the President has unlawfully usurped legislative authority designed to manage the flow of skilled workers.While the Chamber is dominated by corporate giants, Neil Bradley, its Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer stressed the disproportionate harm the fee will inflict on smaller enterprises. ""The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and mid-sized businesses, to utilize the H-1B program,"" Bradley said in a statement. For many start-ups, a $100,000 fee per new employee represents an unsustainable burden that will force them to forgo H1Bs at a time when there is a shortage of qualified STEM graduates in America.The Trump administration has however vigorously defended the measure, asserting it a ""necessary, initial, incremental step"" aimed at ensuring the visa is used strictly to recruit ""great engineers"" and highest-paid talent, rather than for entry-level positions. The policy is rooted in the administration’s core argument -- drummed by some MAGA activists -- that some employers have exploited H-1B loopholes to suppress American wages, displace U.S. workers, and ""spam the system"" by filing high volumes of petitions for lower-skilled roles.Critics warn though that the punitive financial barrier risks triggering a reverse ""brain drain,"" pushing highly sought-after foreign talent toward economic rivals abroad. China and Germany among other nations have opened their doors to foreign talent, and many Indian professionals navigating the uncertain H1B scenario are looking to peel off to neighboring Canada or return home. The Chamber asserts that diminishing the U.S ability to attract and retain the ""world's best and brightest"" threatens the competitiveness and expansion of American companies in the global marketplace.The lawsuit represents a remarkable rift between the Chamber and the Republican White House – allies for long – amid growing disquiet in corporate circles over what some have dubbed as “Right Wing Socialism.” Conservative commentators are flagging actions like President Trump using emergency powers to impose tariffs, the government taking a stake in private corporations like Intel, and hiking H1B fees, saying the moves go against the spirit of free market enterprise that has long characterized the United States.","The U.S Chamber of Commerce is suing the Trump administration over the $100,000 annual fee for H1B visa.

The global economy is going through a period of enhanced turmoil with the trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump . Amidst this uncertainty, International Monetary Fund IMF ) MD Kristalina Georgieva has said that world leaders and central bank governors need to ‘buckle up’.Deepak Ajwani, Editor, Economic Times Online asked IMF what that entails. Pierre Olivier Gourinchas, Chief Economist, International Monetary Fund replied with a four-pronged strategy.“We've been living for the last five, seven years, in an environment in which the global economy is hit by fairly sizable shocks. They can be very concentrated. We can think of covid that was the one in maybe in 100 years, a type of shock. But even after that, with the cost of living crisis, we had the impact of military conflict on European soil. You had the trade tensions. All of these things are disruptive to the global economy. ” he told ET.“Now, for many countries in the world, these things are outside their control. These are not something that you directly have an input and can do something about. So the first part of buckling up is to make sure your economy is as resilient as it can be.And how would you make your economy resilient? Well, number one, you make sure that you have the fiscal buffers that you need, because you're going to need to use them when you're hit by one of these shocks, and if you don't have them, then the impact is going to be much larger. So make sure you protect the fiscal buffers,” he said.“Second, make sure that you have the right institutional environment, so that you have institutions that are trusted, that can do their job, that have frameworks that are strong. That is also going to be helpful in maintaining expectations, in maintaining some sense of stability in the economy,” he elaborated.Pierre Olivier Gourinchas is of the view that countries have to be open to deepening trade ties. “You're going to have to rely on trading partners. No country is an island that can do things on their own, and so making sure that countries remain part of the global economy, that they are integrated, that they find ways to deepen trade ties with partners where it's possible, is an important part also of building that resilience,” he said.“And fourth, growth comes from the private sector. It comes from adoption of technologies that have been developed elsewhere. Most countries are not at the frontier of innovation. Most countries are inside that frontier and catching up with it, or developing that frontier, making sure that the right efforts are made in terms of scaling the labor force in terms of adoption of technology in terms of infrastructure investment so that countries can grow rapidly and unleash private sector innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added.The International Monetary Fund announced on Tuesday that the United States and worldwide economies are expected to demonstrate stronger growth this year than earlier predictions, as the impact of Trump-era tariffs has been less severe than anticipated, although the complete effects remain to be seen.According to the IMF's influential World Economic Outlook semi-annual report, the American economy is projected to grow by 2 per cent in 2025. This represents an increase from the previous forecasts of 1.9 per cent in July and 1.8 per cent in April.The IMF's projections indicate that the US economy will expand by 2.1 per cent in the following year, marginally higher than their earlier prediction by one-tenth of a percentage point.The worldwide economic growth forecast has been revised upwards to 3.2 per cent for this year, improving from the July estimate of 3 per cent. For 2026, the IMF maintains its previous projection of 3.1 per cent growth.",IMF Chief Economist Pierre Olivier Gourinchas says world leaders and central bank governors need to 'buckle up' He says the first part of buckling up is to make sure your economy is as resilient as it can be.

Spirit Airlines announced on Thursday its decision to furlough 365 pilots and downgrade the status of up to 170 pilots in the first quarter of 2026, as part of a broader workforce reduction strategy amid ongoing restructuring efforts.The ultra-low-cost carrier, which filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year this past August, informed the pilots' union of its intention to cut $100 million in annual pilot-related expenses to preserve cash reserves, reported Reuters. ""In line with our ongoing restructuring, we are implementing further measures to align staffing levels with our previously announced capacity reductions and a smaller operating fleet,"" Spirit Airlines stated.Chief operating officer John Bendoraitis, in a memo obtained by Reuters, indicated that the number of furloughs might decrease in the coming weeks due to voluntary attrition. The company plans to open the bid process at the end of November.Currently, Spirit Airlines employs approximately 2,400 pilots. The airline had previously furloughed around 330 pilots and is set to furlough an additional 270 in November. Additionally, Spirit plans to furlough about 1,800 flight attendants, representing roughly one-third of its cabin crew, effective December 1.The Florida-based airline also announced impending reductions across its corporate teams and intends to make staffing adjustments at its maintenance stations based on volume. The carrier will also close its maintenance stations and warehouse operations in Baltimore and Chicago, effective January 1, 2026.In a recent filing, Spirit Airlines projected that the furloughs would save the company $211 million.

'Showed up uninvited': Bessent on China trade negotiator

China hits back at Bessent’s remarks

Bessent’s claims at odds with China





In a sign of growing US-China trade tensions, America’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday called Beijing’s trade official ‘unhinged’, likening him to a wolf warrior - a term normally used for aggressive Chinese diplomats.The stabilising US-China diplomatic relations deteriorated recently following American expansion of technology restrictions and proposed tariffs on Chinese vessels at US ports. Beijing retaliated with corresponding measures, including stricter controls on exports of rare earths and other strategic materials.According to a Bloomberg report, Bessent criticised a senior Chinese trade representative, accusing him of arriving in Washington without invitation and displaying aggressive behaviour characteristic of China's confrontational diplomatic approach.Bessent claimed that Li Chenggang's visit to Washington on August 28 was not authorised by the Donald Trump administration. During a Wednesday press conference, the Treasury chief suggested the vice minister's arrival with provocative rhetoric might indicate independent action.“Perhaps the vice minister who showed up here with very incendiary language on August 28 has gone rogue,” he said.Bessent's criticism targeted one of China's most distinguished trade specialists.Li, who serves as vice minister, holds advanced legal credentials, specifically a Master of Laws qualification from the University of Hamburg in Germany.Bessent expressed strong disapproval of Li's conduct, describing it as disrespectful. During an event, Bessent incorrectly pronounced Li's name as ""Kuanggong"" and called him ‘low level’, despite Li holding full ministerial status in China.Li, aged 58, was designated as China's vice minister of commerce and trade envoy in April, following Trump's announcement of huge Liberation Day tariffs. Working alongside He Lifeng, China's chief trade negotiator, Li has been central to multiple negotiation sessions between the two leading global economies.During his tenure as China's representative to the World Trade Organization in Geneva from February 2021 until his April appointment, Li demonstrated his negotiation skills. Keith Rockwell, a former WTO spokesperson who interacted with Li, describes him as resolute yet measured in his approach.Li established himself as an astute diplomat with comprehensive knowledge during his role leading China's discussions with the Obama administration regarding a bilateral investment agreement.""He knew his stuff"" and ""didn't allow the US to push him around,"" Rockwell shared with Bloomberg News earlier this year.""Chinese officials seldom go rogue, and those that do, tend to end up out of a job especially under Xi Jinping 's heavily centralized rule,"" Thomas said. ""So it's highly unlikely that Li's actions were anything other than approved by Xi in Beijing.""China's Commerce Ministry released a statement on Thursday indicating that Bessent had severely misrepresented the facts. According to spokesperson He Yongqian, Li visited the United States to pursue discussions that followed the earlier discussions between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump.Recent diplomatic exchanges between China and the US have continued, with China putting forward proposals. However, he noted that the US's unreceptive response on shipping issues has compelled China to implement retaliatory measures.China’s Commerce Ministry confirmed that in late August, Li travelled to Washington for meetings with treasury, commerce and trade officials. The ministry's statement noted that during this visit, he stressed the ""principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.""Lin Jian, the spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, emphasised that their nation's stance on trade matters remained ""consistent and clear.""""The US should work with China to resolve relevant issues through dialogue and consultation based on equality, mutual respect and reciprocity, rather than repeatedly resorting to pressure and threats,"" he said.According to the Bloomberg report, Bessent offered a contrasting account, indicating that Li had cautioned about potential ""global chaos"" if the United States proceeded with implementing port fees on Chinese vessels. ""Maybe he thinks he's a wolf warrior,"" he stated.Neil Thomas, Fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, is of the view that Bessent aims to convey to Xi that easing recent export restrictions could facilitate an agreement with President Trump.","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticised a senior Chinese trade representative, accusing him of arriving in Washington without invitation and displaying aggressive behaviour.

Gold soared to record levels as renewed concerns over US credit quality and escalating US-China tensions drove investors toward safe-haven assets.Gold surged 1.2 per cent to $4,379.93 per ounce on Friday, heading for its biggest weekly gain since 2008 and extending a rally that began in August. The surge was underpinned by expectations of steep Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year, which also lifted other precious metals.Meanwhile, Silver also breached its 1980 record on a discontinued Chicago Board of Trade contract, touching $54.38 an ounce before stabilising, as reported by Bloomberg. Palladium and platinum also posted substantial weekly advances.Gold has jumped more than 65 per cent this year, buoyed by central bank buying, ETF inflows, and geopolitical uncertainty. Silver has risen nearly 90 per cent, driven by similar factors and a major supply squeeze in London that pushed benchmark prices above New York futures.More than 15 million ounces of silver were withdrawn from Comex-linked warehouses in recent days, reportedly to ease tightness in London. The price gap between the two markets has narrowed to 70 cents per ounce from $3 earlier.As of 7:57 a.m. in Singapore, spot gold was up 1 per cent at $4,369.14 per ounce, bringing its weekly gain to 8.7 per cent.Platinum rose 8 per cent this week, and palladium surged 16 per cent.Market sentiment turned volatile on Thursday after two US regional banks disclosed loan irregularities involving fraud allegations, sparking fresh concerns about borrower stability. The developments, alongside heightened US-China trade tensions and limited economic data amid the Washington shutdown, fuelled safe-haven demand.Investors are increasingly pricing in aggressive rate reductions by year-end, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signalled another quarter-point cut this month — a backdrop favouring non-yielding assets like gold and silver.Additionally, china’s Commerce Minister Wang Wentao blamed Washington for recent diplomatic strains, warning against economic decoupling. His remarks followed US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s criticism of a Chinese trade official’s surprise Washington visit as “unhinged”.","Gold surged 1.2 per cent to $4,379.93 per ounce on Friday, heading for its biggest weekly gain since 2008.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH





US Chamber of Commerce took legal action against the government’s decision to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa petitions on Thursday, saying the move violates existing immigration law.In its complaint, the Chamber argued that the new fee goes beyond the limits set by the Immigration and Nationality Act, which requires visa charges to reflect only the government’s administrative costs. Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s executive vice president and chief policy officer, said the steep fee would make it nearly impossible for many US employers, especially start-ups and small businesses to hire skilled foreign workers.""The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for US employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utiliSe the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the US,"" Bradley said, as per an official release by the US Chamber of Commerce.Bradley also noted that while president Trump’s administration has prioritised border security and economic growth, the Chamber believed the US economy still needed skilled workers to sustain expansion.He said the Chamber supports targeted immigration reforms that simplify the visa process and help retain global talent in the country.""President Trump has embarked on an ambitious agenda of securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unraveling the overregulation that has stifled growth. The Chamber and our members have actively backed these proposals to attract more investment in America. To support this growth, our economy will require more workers, not fewer,"" it said.The organisation added that it is willing to work with Congress and the administration to create a fairer and more practical system for employers who depend on the H-1B programme.","US Chamber of Commerce took legal action against the government’s decision to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa petitions on Thursday.

Mortgage trends: US 30-year rate slips to 6.27% this week; housing sales remain sluggish,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/mortgage-trends-us-30-year-rate-slips-to-6-27-this-week-housing-sales-remain-sluggish/articleshow/124609992.cms,"



The average long-term US mortgage rate declined again this week, hovering just above its lowest level for 2025, as easing Treasury yields and Federal Reserve rate expectations continued to bring relief to borrowers, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.Freddie Mac said on Thursday that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage slipped to 6.27% from 6.3% last week. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.44%, AP reported. The current level is just above 6.26%, last seen four weeks ago after a steady run of declines pushed borrowing costs to their lowest since early October 2024.Rates on 15-year fixed mortgages, often used by homeowners refinancing existing loans, also edged lower — dropping to 5.52% from 5.53% a week earlier. A year ago, the average stood at 5.63%, Freddie Mac said.Mortgage rates typically mirror movements in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a benchmark for home loan pricing. The 10-year yield was 4.02% at midday Thursday, down from 4.14% a week ago.Rates have been sliding since July, ahead of the Federal Reserve’s decision last month to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in a year amid concerns about the weakening US job market.At their September meeting, Fed officials projected two more cuts this year and one in 2026. However, the central bank could shift its stance if inflation rises again, especially as the Trump administration expands tariff measures and trade tensions with China intensify.Analysts noted that further Fed rate cuts don’t necessarily translate into lower mortgage rates. “Last fall, after the Fed cut its rate for the first time in more than four years, mortgage rates marched higher, eventually reaching just above 7% in January this year,” Freddie Mac said.The average 30-year mortgage rate has remained above 6% since September 2022, when borrowing costs began rising sharply from record lows. The US housing market has struggled since then, with home sales remaining subdued.Sales of previously occupied homes in the US fell last year to their lowest level in nearly three decades, and so far in 2025, volumes continue to lag behind year-ago levels, signalling continued weakness in housing demand despite easing rates.","The average long-term US mortgage rate declined again this week, hovering just above its lowest level for 2025.

US markets today: Stocks rise led by Nvidia and AI gains; volatility keeps investors cautious,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-markets-today-stocks-rise-led-by-nvidia-and-ai-gains-volatility-keeps-investors-cautious/articleshow/124607770.cms,"



US stocks ticked higher on Thursday as technology shares rallied following signs of strong demand in the artificial-intelligence (AI) sector. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 116 points or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5%, though markets remained choppy throughout the week, AP reported.Tech stocks led gains after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) reported a larger-than-expected profit for the latest quarter. CFO Wendell Huang said the company anticipates “continued strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies” through the end of the year. TSMC, a key chipmaker for AI companies including Nvidia, saw its Taiwan-listed shares climb 1.4%, while its US-listed stock slipped 0.2%.Nvidia rose 1.3%, emerging as the top contributor to the S&P 500 rally, reflecting its position as Wall Street’s most valuable stock. Analysts warn that the surge in AI stocks has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble of 2000, even as inflation remains high and the job market slows.Salesforce jumped 8% after announcing plans to deliver over 10% compounded annual revenue growth in coming years, helping lift the Dow.Freight company J.B. Hunt Transport Services soared 17.3% after exceeding third-quarter profit expectations. These gains offset a 4% drop for Travelers, whose profits beat forecasts but revenue fell short. Hewlett Packard Enterprise fell 8.8% after setting long-term financial targets that analysts considered modest.Global markets also saw broad gains. South Korea’s Kospi surged 2.5% amid optimism over a potential US-Seoul trade deal, with Samsung Electronics and automakers Hyundai Motor and Kia leading the rally. Chinese indexes edged up 0.1% in Shanghai but fell 0.1% in Hong Kong as trade tensions with the US lingered.In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield eased to 4.04% from 4.05% late Wednesday. A report showed that manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region unexpectedly contracted, offering a limited view of economic conditions as the Federal Reserve weighs inflation against a slowing labour market.Market updates have also been disrupted by the US government shutdown, delaying key economic releases including weekly unemployment claims and inflation data that typically guide trading on Wall Street.","The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 116 points, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5%.

"LVMH shares soar 14% on strong China demand: European luxury stocks adds $80 bn, investors cheer sector revival",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/lvmh-shares-soar-14-on-strong-china-demand-european-luxury-stocks-adds-80-bn-investors-cheer-sector-revival/articleshow/124602731.cms,"



Shares of luxury giant LVMH had their best day in over two decades on Wednesday, soaring as much as 14% after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly sales that signalled a possible revival in Chinese demand. The rally added nearly $80 billion to the combined market value of European luxury stocks, according to Reuters report.The world’s largest luxury group, which owns Louis Vuitton, Dior, Moët, and Hennessy, posted its first quarterly sales rise this year, beating forecasts and sparking a sector-wide surge. Rivals including Hermès, Kering, Richemont, Burberry, and Moncler gained between 5% and 9% as investors cheered signs that the industry may be pulling out of its two-year slump.“The sales figures indeed surprised investors positively and are likely to keep the sector’s share price momentum alive,” said Stefan Bauknecht, equity portfolio manager at DWS. Analysts at Bernstein noted that sales exceeded expectations across all divisions — from fashion and jewellery to spirits and hospitality.While optimism is returning, several analysts cautioned against reading too much into the rebound.Jefferies noted that it was “too early to talk about a general recovery” and questioned whether early signs from LVMH were being mistaken for an industry-wide turnaround.According to Reuters calculations, the LVMH-led rally added roughly $80 billion in market capitalisation to companies in the STOXX Europe Luxury 10 index — the biggest such jump since early 2024. The gains come amid hopes that sweeping creative and management changes at top brands will begin to pay off.Sales in mainland China — a key growth engine for global luxury — turned positive, with consumers responding well to immersive retail concepts such as Louis Vuitton’s ship-shaped boutique in Shanghai. Sales from travelling Chinese shoppers also improved, though they remained lower than last year.Chinese demand, which accounts for nearly one-third of global luxury sales, had been hit hard by the property downturn, US trade tensions, and economic uncertainty.Ariane Hayate, European equity fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild, said the third-quarter performance was “reassuring”, citing “idiosyncratic” growth factors such as Louis Vuitton’s initiatives in China. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division — its core profit driver — improved sequentially but still recorded a 2% year-on-year decline.LVMH Chief Financial Officer Cecile Cabanis said on Tuesday that “economic uncertainty and unfavourable exchange rates” would continue to affect the group’s performance in the fourth quarter. UBS forecasts a 4% organic sales growth for the sector next year, expecting momentum to pick up only in the second half of 2026 as new designer collections reach stores.","Shares of luxury giant LVMH had their best day in over two decades on Wednesday, soaring as much as 14% after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly sales.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Small Wonders of India's Exports

India's Exports

India’s exports basket is seeing a big growth with some surprise items! The country’s export portfolio is diversifying with significant growth in unexpected items like bananas, ghee, furniture, office supplies, and solar photovoltaic (PV) modules. Whilst traditional exports like engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery remain dominant, these emerging sectors are providing additional momentum to overseas trade.India's export performance requires diversification, particularly given the 4.83% decline in goods exports during November, affecting sectors like petroleum products, gems and jewellery, iron ore, and agricultural produce.The commerce and industry ministry has set an ambitious target to surpass £800 billion in combined goods and services exports for FY25.""Banana is among the 20 agri products we have identified whose exports we want to boost as, at present, India's share is low in their global exports,"" an official told ET.The government has identified several agricultural products including watermelons, ghee, guavas, green chilli, capsicum, okra, garlic, onions and alcoholic beverages for export promotion.India aims to increase its global export share to 4-5% in the coming years from the current 2.5%. Countries like the US, Malaysia, Canada, Russia, Germany, France, South Korea, China, Indonesia, Japan, Italy, Belgium and the UK present substantial opportunities.""The acceptance for Indian single malt whisky is growing in the EU, US and the far East,"" said Anant Iyer, director general, Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC).Alcoholic beverage exports increased by 8% year-on-year during April-October, with whisky exports rising by 16%. Officials also noted growth in specific spice exports, particularly black pepper.Office stationery products are gaining popularity in markets like Nicaragua, El Salvador and Cyprus. India has become the sixth largest exporter of solar PV modules globally, with its share in global exports increasing to 2.51% in 2023 from 0.4% in 2013.Also Read | Top 10 Countries With Highest Gold Reserves 2024: India Moves Up Ranks! Where do the US, China Stand? Check List During April-October, India's exports of PV cells in modules or panels reached $711.95 million, with the US receiving 96% of these shipments. According to Deepali Agrawal, deputy managing director of India Exim Bank, toy exports are expected to maintain their growth trajectory.""Furthermore, the export of dyes, organic chemicals, and inorganic chemicals is projected to remain strong, supported by improving global demand sentiments,"" she said.The PLI schemes are expected to bolster electronics and engineering goods sectors, maintaining their position as key growth drivers.""The automotive sector is also set to witness a surge in export revenues, underpinned by improving global demand in key markets and the adoption of the China+1 strategy by global players, which is driving diversification in sourcing and manufacturing locations,"" Agrawal said.""India's apparel exports are also likely to maintain their upward trajectory.""Despite potential challenges in petroleum product exports, analysts indicate that non-oil merchandise and services exports will lead the country's overall export performance. The government is actively exploring new markets, including France, Saudi Arabia and Kenya for iron ore exports.For pharmaceutical exports, the focus is on Latvia, Chad and Montenegro, whilst Greece and Croatia are being targeted for engineering goods. Additionally, Guatemala and Morocco are being developed as new destinations for Indian cotton yarn exports.","The commerce and industry ministry has set an ambitious target to surpass £800 billion in combined goods and services exports for FY25.

Centre estimates GDP growth at 6.4% in FY25,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-estimates-gdp-growth-at-6-4-in-fy25/articleshow/117036214.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's economy is estimated to slow to a four-year low in 2024-25 due to moderation in manufacturing and sluggish investment, while robust growth in the farm sector is expected to provide some support and help boost rural consumption.The first advance estimates for the current financial year, released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on Tuesday, showed gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to grow by 6.4%, sharply lower than the 8.2% recorded in 2023-24.The growth rate is a shade lower than Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) downwardly revised projection of 6.6% for 2024-25; it's also lower than estimates of several agencies, including the govt's, which have pegged it in the 6.5%-7% range. The 6.4% growth projection is the lowest since the Covid-19 pandemic and comes on the back of a slowdown in overall investment and consumption in urban areas.The slowdown was expected given the deceleration in the July-Sept quarter when growth slowed to a seven-quarter low of 5.4%, triggering calls for a rate cut by the central bank.A recent finance ministry report had said that a combination of monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures by the central bank, and structural factors, could have led to the slowdown and all eyes are now on the Feb 1 Budget for measures to revive demand and push growth against the backdrop of global uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.There are also expectations of a rate cut by RBI in the Feb policy meeting.Tuesday's data showed manufacturing growth is estimated to slow to 5.3% in 2024-25 from 9.9% in the previous year, while services sector is estimated to expand at 7.2% in 2024-25 compared to 7.6% in the previous year.The farm sector remains a bright spot and is projected to expand 3.8% this year compared to 1.8% in the previous year. The construction sector has also remained healthy at 8.6% compared to 9.4% in the previous year.The data estimated private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) at constant prices to grow 7.3% during this fiscal year, over the 4% rise last year. PFCE is the total amount of money spent by households and non-profit entities that serve households on the final consumption of goods and services.NSO said the advance estimates of GDP are indicator based and compiled using the benchmark-indicator method - the estimates available for the previous financial year (2023-24) are extrapolated using the relevant indicators reflecting the performance of sectors.",India's economy is estimated to slow to a four-year low in 2024-25.

Truckers see Maha Kumbh business surge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/truckers-see-maha-kumbh-business-surge/articleshow/117036076.cms,"CHENNAI: Call it the Maha Kumbh effect. Transporters and truckers are witnessing up to 40% increase in trucking activity in the lead up to the Maha Kumbh. The just released Shriram Mobility Report has estimated a 30-40% spike in trucking activity to the Prayagraj in Dec 2024, spurred by preparations for the Maha Kumbh from Jan 13 to Feb 26. Other transporters say there has been a nearly 73% jump in truck rentals in the key Delhi-NCR to Prayagraj route with other north-based routes also reporting a sharp increase in rentals.Y S Chakravarti, MD & CEO, Shriram Finance said: ""The upcoming Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj is driving a surge in trucking demand to that region, but restrictions during the event, until Feb 26, 2025 may temper this momentum."" The Maha Kumbh demand surge contrasts with a tepid Dec when ""truck rentals on major trunk routes remained steady and fleet occupancy levels continued to remain subdued,"" he added.According to transporters, this surge has led to a sharp increase in truck rentals to Prayagraj. ""Truck rentals have seen a sharp increase in the last three weeks. The Delhi to Prayagraj round trip used to cost Rs 22,000 just 20 days ago but now it costs Rs 38,000. However, there is no return load available at Prayagraj and trucks are returning via Lucknow and Ayodhya to get return load,"" said Ramesh Aggarwal of the All-India Transporters Welfare Association.The Maha Kumbh, he added, is attracting five-times more trucking load this year than the last Kumbh Mela in 2013. Transporters say the biggest surge in truck load is in FMCG, fruits and vegetables, textiles and even petro products. Said SP Singh, senior fellow and coordinator, Indian Foundation of Transport Research & Training: Already oil companies have hired high capacity trucks to move CNG to Prayagraj for increased transportation since all buses and trucks operating inside the city are CNG vehicles.",Transporters and truckers are witnessing up to 40% increase in trucking activity in the lead up to the Maha Kumbh.

Run-up to Budget 2025: Make it easy for non-residents to fulfil Indian tax obligations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/run-up-to-budget-2025-make-it-easy-for-non-residents-to-fulfil-indian-tax-obligations/articleshow/117039416.cms,"Set thresholds for obtaining a

tax residency certificate

:

Relax norms in the filing of Form 10F for claiming tax treaty benefits:

Easing procedural challenges:

While an Indian residing abroad is popularly referred to as a non-resident Indian (NRI), the nomenclature is different under tax laws. It is not the country of origin, but the number of days stay in India, which determine whether a person will be a resident or non-resident for tax purposes.Resident individuals are taxable in India on their global income, irrespective of where it was earned. In simple words, in the case of non-residents only income that accrues or arises in India (say, bank interest from a savings account in India, or rental income from a house in Mumbai), is treated as taxable in India. Thus, salary received by non-residents in a bank account overseas, for services performed outside India, is not subject to tax in India.According to tax experts, there are several measures that can be introduced this budget to make compliance easier for the non-resident taxpayer.A non-resident taxpayer can take advantage of the applicable tax treaty provisions, which often offer a lower tax rate, say for dividend income arising from shares held in India. Under section 90 (2) of the Income-tax (I-T) Act, in respect of a non-resident tax payer (covered by a tax treaty), the provisions of the I-T Act apply to the extent they are more beneficial. So if the tax treaty provides a lower rate, it is this lower rate that will apply and not the domestic tax rate.However, under section 90 (4) a ‘Tax Residency Certificate’ (TRC) is required to be furnished by the taxpayer to get the tax treaty benefit – this is required to be furnished irrespective of the nature of income or the quantum of income.The Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) in its pre-budget memorandum suggests that when the amounts involved are very small, this provision for obtaining the TRC creates unintended hardship to both non-resident recipients and the resident payer as it involves cost/time cost to obtain such TRCs. The association suggests that there must be some threshold limit for obtaining the TRC.Currently, non-resident taxpayers are required to electronically file Form 10F on the e-Filing portal to avail any tax treaty benefits. Along with Form 10F, non-resident taxpayers are required to provide a copy of the TRC from the overseas tax authorities for the entire financial year to confirm their residency status in the other country.According to Rohinton Sidhwa, tax partner at Deloitte-India, “No overseas tax authorities provide a TRC certifying that the taxpayer is a tax resident for the future period. Hence, suitable amendments can be made along with Form 10F, where the taxpayer can furnish TRCs from the previous period (say, for the last 1–2 years) and a copy of the TRC for the current financial year may be provided later (say at the time of filing of its tax return in India).”Non-resident taxpayers need to have a bank account in India, to facilitate tax payments. Divya Baweja, tax partner at Deloitte-India explains that tax payments in India are accepted through various modes, such as net banking, debit cards, NEFT/RTGS and over-the-bank counter. The bandwidth has been broadened to include many Indian banks and NEFT/RTGS payments and UPI payments. “However, these are possible with an Indian bank only, which makes it difficult for an NRI to make tax payments. NR taxpayers residing overseas would benefit if they were allowed to make tax payments from their overseas bank accounts,” explains Baweja.He adds that the introduction of e-filing of tax returns has improved the process, saving both time and effort. The last mile step of e-filing is the e-verification process, which is restricted to having accounts with net banking/demat facilities with specified banks, Aadhaar OTP to India mobile numbers, digital signature certificates, etc.“Non-resident taxpayers who need to complete the tax return filing process could benefit if the e-verification process can be extended via OTP to foreign mobile numbers or have two-factor authentication (different OTPs for foreign mobile numbers and email addresses). This would reduce paperwork and administrative tasks, such as tracking the ITR-V receipt by the tax office and applying for condonation of delays. Further, the time limit of 30 days should be extended to facilitate verification through physical mode,” he adds.Lastly, non-resident individuals, especially foreign nations, who who leave India after closing their bank accounts in India could get a refund for various reasons. The tax refund is payable only to pre-validated Indian bank accounts. Any delay in refund processing could cause bank accounts (even if open under the NRO status) to go into dormant mode. This would prevent the refund from being credited to the account. “To alleviate the difficulty, foreign bank accounts should be considered for tax refunds for PAN-holders registered as Non-residents/foreign nationals,” states Baweja.","Resident individuals are taxable in India on their global income, irrespective of where it was earned. Non-resident taxpayers need to have a bank account in India, to facilitate tax payments. Tax treaty provisions often offer a lower tax rate, say for dividend income arising from shares held in India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117039440,imgsize-797733,width-400,resizemode-4/117039440.jpg"
Run-up to Budget 2025: Expand tax deferment on ESOPs to boost start-ups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/run-up-to-budget-2025-expand-tax-deferment-on-esops-to-boost-start-ups/articleshow/117038981.cms,"Immediate tax liability on employees receiving shares without actual monetary gains.



Strain on startups' finances due to tax deductions often exceeding employees’ salaries.



At the time of exercise, there is a tax on perquisite value: When the employee has exercised the option, the difference between the Fair Market Value (on exercise date) and the exercise price is taxed as perquisite. The employer deducts TDS on this perquisite.

At the time of sale, there is a tax on capital gains: When the employee sells the shares, the difference between the sale price and Fair Market Value as on the date of exercise constitutes the capital gains, which is subject to tax.



Recommendations for expansion

Eligibility for all DPIIT-recognized startups: Separate the ESOP tax deferment eligibility from the tax holiday under Section 80-IAC of the Income Tax Act.

Safeguards for eligibility: Adequate safeguards can be built in. ESOPs should be available only to Indian resident employees of DPIIT-registered startups. Uniform terms should apply to all employees receiving ESOPs.



Need for clarity on ESOP

taxation

for non-resident employees

Allowability of ESOP expenditure to the employer

Recommendation for allowability of ESOP expenditure:

ESOP expenses debited to profit and loss account should be an allowable expense for deduction for computing the business income.



It is suggested that a specific provision be incorporated permitting ESOP expenditure to be allowed as revenue deduction in the computation of income. Such provision may also consider the quantum of expenditure to be allowed and timing of deduction for consistency across all types of companies.



The government introduced a tax deferment policy for Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) in 2020 to address two key challenges faced by startup employees and employers:ESOPs are taxed in 2 instances:From the financial year 2020-21, an employee receiving ESOPs from an ‘eligible’ start-up need not pay tax in the year of exercising the option. The TDS on the ‘perquisite’ stands deferred to earlier of the following events: Expiry of five years from the year of allotment of ESOPs; Date of sale of the ESOPs by the employee or date of termination of employmentWhile ESOPs are critical for attracting and retaining high-quality talent in startups, the policy has had limited impact. Currently, only employees of 3,605 startups certified by the Inter-Ministerial Board (IMB) under the Income Tax Act are eligible for tax deferment. This represents just 2.5% of the over 143,000 startups recognized by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), states NASSCOM, in its pre-budget memorandum.The case for expanding tax deferment: Employee attrition in startups remains high, estimated at over 40%. ESOPs are a key tool to counter this, offering employees wealth creation opportunities. However, given that 8-9 of every 10 startups fail, many ESOPs end up worthless. Employees also face the risk of paying perquisite tax on notional profits without actual gains.Expanding the tax deferment policy to all DPIIT-recognized startups could enable smaller startups to compete with larger businesses for talent, creating a robust ecosystem that fuels entrepreneurship and economic growth. Concerns about tax avoidance appear unfounded, as ESOPs are non-cash perquisites with limited abuse potential, explains NASSCOM.Moreover, ESOPs are predominantly offered by startups with scalable business models, not traditional businesses where wealth creation is slower. Expanding the policy is unlikely to lead to widespread misuse or excessive issuance of ESOPs.To ensure the policy’s effectiveness while maintaining safeguards, NASSCOM recommends:NASSCOM sums up by stating that a broader tax deferment regime for ESOPs can empower startups to attract top talent, reduce attrition, and focus on growth instead of administrative burdens. In turn, this would strengthen the overall startup ecosystem, driving innovation and economic progress.Other issues also arise in relation to ESOPs which could be resolved in the coming Budget 2025 .According to Divya Baweja, tax partner at Deloitte-India, “Section 17(2) of the Income-tax (I-T) Act, provides for taxing stock award benefits as a perquisite in the hands of employees. However, the section lacks clarity regarding the taxation of stock awards in the case of Non-Resident employees who have rendered a part of services overseas during the grant period to vest. The principle that the benefit accrues over the vesting period is indicated based on court rulings and OECD guidelines.”“However, in the absence of clear guidance, the claim of the taxpayers is denied at the assessment stage by the tax officer. While at the appellate level, claims are accepted, the taxpayers have to go through unnecessary hardship of litigation,” he adds.Baweja suggests that clear guidelines stating rules for apportionment of this benefit based on the grant to vesting period should be provided. Further, only the place of rendering services should be considered for apportionment.Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) in its pre-budget memorandum points out that present there is no express provision in the I-T Act about allowability of ESOP expenditure while computing taxable income.SEBI guidelines prescribe method for charging of ESOP discount in the books of accounts of listed entities. Despite this, many times, in the absence of an express provision in the Act on allowability of ESOP expenditure as deduction while computing taxable income, tax authorities do not treat ESOP expense as deductible while computing the business income. This leads to litigation. There are Rulings from different courts / tribunals giving favourable views regarding allowability of ESOP expenditure. Since ESOP expenditure is employee compensation, the same should be allowed as revenue expenditure.","The government introduced a tax deferment policy for Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) in 2020 to address two key challenges faced by startup employees and employers.

EV sales zoom 20% to nearly 1L units in 2024 on price cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ev-sales-zoom-20-to-nearly-1l-units-in-2024-on-price-cuts/articleshow/117036047.cms,"NEW DELHI: Price cuts towards end of 2024 saw sales of electric cars rise 20%, with the industry's volumes finishing a shade lower than one lakh units against 82,688 units in the previous year.The growth comes despite doubts about a mass adoption for EVs as customers complain over a poor public charging infrastructure, longevity of battery, and resale price of the vehicles after a few years.Retail numbers sourced from dealer association Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), shows electric vehicles finished 2024 with a share of 2.4% in total auto retail of 40.7 lakh units. This share was 2.1% in 2023.Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles (those powered by petrol, petrol-CNG, petrol-battery (hybrids) and diesels) continued to have lion's share, bringing out the fact that it is still a long way to go for EVs in their quest for a sizeable market size.Tata Motors' continued to lead the EV market with sales of 61,496 units in 2024 (60,100 in 2023), even though its market share in electrics dropped to 62% against 73% in the previous year. Tata sells electric versions of an array of ICE models, which include Tiago hatch, Tigor sedan, Punch mini SUV, and Nexon and Curvv SUVs. The company is likely to up the ante this year, with electric versions expected for Harrier and Safari, apart from new launch Sierra (all SUVs).JSW MG Motor was the second-ranked in EV sales as it saw 125% growth in 2024 at 21,484 units against 9,526 units in previous year. The company's surge was led by launch of Windsor SUV that came with a 'battery as a service' or battery rental model, which enabled it to lower the threshold of EV acquisition. ""2024 marked a year of transformation for us. We registered an outstanding growth, with Windsor EV emerging as market leader and becoming highest-selling electric car for three consecutive months.

HMPV Mumbai: 6-month-old tests positive for HMPV in Mumbai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/1-case-of-hmpv-detected-in-city-6-mth-old-out-of-hosp/articleshow/117031465.cms,"A six-month-old baby in Mumbai tested positive for the human metapneumovirus (HMPV), which has seen a surge in Beijing. Health authorities are notified, but national guidelines don't mandate reporting HMPV cases.

MUMBAI: A six-month-old baby admitted to a hospital's intensive care unit last week tested positive for the human metapneumovirus (HMPV), which has been in the news after Chinese authorities reported a surge in cases in Beijing.Doctors at Hiranandani Hospital in Powai on Tuesday told TOI that they notified the local civic office about the HMPV case confirmed on Jan 1, but BMC health officials at the civic health headquarters, which is in Parel, said they had not yet received any such report. Across the country, a dozen cases were reported in the last couple of days; doctors from a private hospital in Nagpur reported two cases on Monday.Reports on the HMPV surge in China have raised public fears about another pandemic, but health authorities maintain that the virus has been in circulation for decades and is unlikely to cause a Covid-like situation. ""New rapid tests are now available that can, within a few hours, identify the viruses causing, say, influenza. HMPV is one of the viruses that these tests, which cost around Rs 7,000, can identify,"" said a public health department doctor, adding that fever cases caused by this existing virus are hence being noticed.The official also said that the national guidelines have not made it mandatory for doctors and laboratories to alert health officials about HMPV cases. ""If doctors and laboratories do tell us about HMPV cases, we would be able to carry out better surveillance in specific areas for a surge in flu-like illnesses,"" said the official.When contacted, BMC executive health officer Dr Daksha Shah said that the BMC has stepped up its surveillance for influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection. Regarding the Powai case, she said her office hasn't yet received any notification.According to Dr Sanjeev Ahuja, the paediatrician from Hiranandani Hospital who treated the six-month-old baby, she was brought to the hospital on Jan 1 with a severe cough and difficulty in breathing. ""As she had severe chest congestion and low oxygen saturation of 84, we admitted her to the ICU,"" he said. Several tests, including the new, rapid multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses, were conducted.The lab confirmed HMPV, but as there is no specific treatment for many viruses, the doctors had to provide symptomatic treatment for the child. ""We use bronchodilator drugs that help open airways,"" added Dr Ahuja. The child was discharged on the fifth day after admission.He said that such rapid PCR tests are not conducted frequently. ""We would routinely not take her for a PCR test, but given her poor oxygen concentration, we thought it would be safer.""Studies have shown HMPV has been active across the country, with young children and senior citizens most affected. A study done between July 2022 and March 2023 by a private hospital in Pune found that 13% of the 114 viral fever cases among children under one year of age were caused by HMPV.","A six-month-old baby in Mumbai tested positive for the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) The virus has been in the news after Chinese authorities reported a surge in cases in Beijing.

McDonald's rolls back diversity practices; which other US firms have done the same?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/mcdonalds-rolls-back-diversity-practices-which-other-us-firms-have-done-the-same/articleshow/117032353.cms,"What is the DEI initiative?

Other companies scaling back DEI initiatives

Walmart

Ford

Lowe’s

John Deere

Tractor Supply

McDonald’s has announced crucial changes to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, joining a growing list of companies pulling back on such initiatives. The fast-food giant cited the US Supreme Court’s July 2023 ruling, which also banned affirmative action in college admissions, as a key factor influencing its decision.The Chicago-based burger chain will discontinue specific diversity goals for senior leadership and retire its program encouraging suppliers to adopt DEI training.Additionally, the fast food entity’s diversity team will be rebranded as the Global Inclusion Team, a shift the company says better reflects its values and business focus. Despite these changes,McDonald’s emphasised its commitment to fostering inclusion, calling a diverse workforce a “competitive advantage.”Back in 2021, McDonald's introduced a range of diversity initiatives following multiple sexual harassment lawsuits from employees and a discrimination lawsuit filed by a group of Black former franchise owners.At the time, McDonald's chairman and CEO Chris Kempczinski wrote in a LinkedIn post, ""As a world-leading brand that considers inclusion one of our core values, we will accept nothing less than real, measurable progress in our efforts to lead with empathy, treat people with dignity and respect, and seek out diverse points of view to drive better decision-making.""However, the company said that the ""shifting legal landscape"" following the Supreme Court decision and the actions of other corporations caused it to reconsider its own policies.This decision reflects a broader trend as conservative activists challenge DEI programs in corporate America, targeting workplace initiatives aimed at supporting historically marginalised groups. Critics argue such policies are unfair and advocate for equal opportunities without consideration of race, gender, or sexual orientation.The DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiative refers to a set of policies and programs aimed at promoting a more inclusive and equitable environment within organisations. These initiatives often include measures to promote diversity in leadership roles, support historically marginalised groups, and ensure fair treatment regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation.Conservative activists have been targeting companies through legal action and social media campaigns, aiming to challenge workplace initiatives. Their focus includes diversity programs and hiring practices designed to support historically marginalised groups, as well as broader objections to initiatives centred on gender identity and sexual orientation.The world’s largest retailer had announced earlier in November that it would not renew its five-year commitment to an equity racial centre established after George Floyd’s death in 2020. It also exited the Human Rights Campaign’s LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion index and revised its supplier diversity policies, ceasing to prioritise demographic factors such as race and gender.Furthermore, Walmart pledged to monitor its third party marketplace more closely to prevent the sale of products aimed at LGBTQ+ minors, such as chest binders for transgender youth.In August, Ford’s CEO Jim Farley outlined changes to the company’s DEI policies, including withdrawing from the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. Farley stated that thr company does not use hiring quotas or link compensation to diversity metrics but remains committed to fostering an inclusive workplace.“We will continue to put our effort and resources into taking care of our customers, our team, and our communities versus publicly commenting on the many polarizing issues of the day,” the memo stated.Lowe’s also reevaluated its DEI programs, consolidating employee resource groups into one organisation and stepping back from LGBTQ+ inclusion events like parades and festivals. The retailer said these adjustments were made following the Supreme Court’s affirmative action decision.Previously, the company had “individual groups representing diverse sections of our associate population.”It will cease to participate in festivals and parades that are outside of its business domain.In July, the farm equipment manufacturer announced it would no longer sponsor cultural awareness events or implement diversity quotas. John Deere also committed to auditing its training materials to ensure compliance with federal laws and to remove “socially motivated messages.”Moline, Illinois based company further added “the existence of diversity quotas and pronoun identification have never been and are not company policy.” However, it would still work to “track and advance” the diversity of the company.The rural retailer eliminated all DEI roles and goals in June after facing conservative backlash online. It also announced it would cease sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns and no longer be submitting data for the HRC index.The National Black Farmers Association also called on Tractor Supply’s president and CEO to step down shortly after the company's announcement.","McDonald's has announced changes to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies.

The United States followed with $1.9 billion, while Japan ranked third with $1 billion in imports, according to the SME Times.Food minister Oh Yu-Kyoung said, ""The government will strengthen cooperation with trading partner countries to help local firms continue the growth of cosmetic exports while helping them meet safety standards in the US and China.""South Korea’s cosmetic exports have undergone consistent growth since 2014, when shipments were valued at $1.8 billion.

Exports of medical instruments grew modestly by 1.8 per cent to $1.37 billion, driven by laser equipment sales.Cumulatively, South Korea’s bio-health exports totalled $18.5 billion for the January-September period, marking a 15.6 per cent increase from the previous year.","The total value of South Korea's cosmetic exports surged by 20.6 per cent annually, reaching an all time high of $10.2 billion. This impressive growth was credited to the Hallyu wave which amplified the global appeal of Korean cultural exports. China emerged as the largest importer of South Korean cosmetics, purchasing $2.5 billion worth of products.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116990987,imgsize-1418955,width-400,resizemode-4/116990987.jpg"

Investors are on the lookout for the next big play, and everybody is wondering which token might rival Shiba Inu 's legendary 2021 rally. Fartcoin and Remittix are among the contenders generating buzz, each with unique features and potential. While Fartcoin has caught attention with its quirky appeal, Remittix stands out in terms of real-world utility and game-changing technology. Let’s find out why experts believe Remittix is more likely to achieve 1,000x returns. Remittix is a crypto platform that intends to revolutionize and streamline the crypto-to-fiat transaction pipeline. Remittix's PayFi protocol allows anybody with a crypto wallet to send fiat cash to any account globally, offering significantly lower fees compared to services like Western Union or MoneyGram.The magic lies in how Remittix connects local payment networks with over 40 blockchain ecosystems. The recipient doesn’t need to know the transaction came from crypto, and senders avoid foreign exchange fees entirely.This innovative approach simplifies crypto-to-fiat transactions, solving a major market need. Many experts believe Remittix could become the top choice for individuals and businesses seeking a seamless way to handle crypto and fiat payments.With blockchain technology ensuring secure, tamper-proof payment records, Remittix already earned the nickname “Ripple 2.0.” Its native token, $RTX, features a token vesting plan to maintain long-term value and stability. Token holders also enjoy staking rewards of up to 18% APY and governance rights.Currently priced at just $0.0185, $RTX offers an exciting opportunity for early investors. Industry predictions suggest it could surpass $1 by 2025, making it a potential game-changer in the DeFi space.Since its launch in October, Fartcoin has quickly gained a massive following. It reached a $1 billion market cap faster than major memecoins like Dogecoin, which took eight years to hit the same milestone. The coin even broke into mainstream culture, catching the attention of late-night host Stephen Colbert.Recently, Fartcoin hit an all-time high of $1.53 and is now trading at $1.45, reflecting a 66% increase over the past week. Its rapid rise is partly linked to its connection with Truth Terminal, an AI-driven X account that inspired the coin’s name. The project was later launched on the Solana-based meme coin platform Pump.fun.Fartcoin’s unique origins and strong momentum have positioned it as one of the most talked-about memecoins in the market today.The Shiba Inu (SHIB) team has officially announced its long-awaited TREAT token launch this January. While the exact date hasn’t been revealed, the announcement came from TREAT’s official X account, generating excitement among investors.This milestone follows years of delays and marks a breakthrough for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. In 2024, the team used $12 million from a TREAT token fundraiser to develop its Layer-3 privacy blockchain. Although a public sale was expected shortly after, no timeline was provided, leading to speculation.Shytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, emphasized that TREAT will drive the project closer to full decentralization while supporting innovation and growth. Currently trading at $0.00002432, Shiba Inu has risen 6% since January 3rd, with CoinCodex predicting a 109% price surge after the next U.S. presidential inauguration. Remittix stands out as the top contender for 1,000x gains in 2025, thanks to its real-world utility and innovative payment solution. Unlike Shiba Inu or Fartcoin, it solves a genuine problem by simplifying global crypto-to-fiat transactions. With strong fundamentals and growing adoption, Remittix is primed for explosive growth.Join the Remittix (RTX) presale and community:","Remittix is a crypto platform that intends to revolutionize and streamline the crypto-to-fiat transaction pipeline.

'Unrealistic scheduling': US Transportation department slaps $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/unrealistic-scheduling-us-transportation-department-slaps-a-2-million-penalty-on-jetblue-airways/articleshow/116923380.cms,"Settlement

Chronic delays



The US transportation department has imposed a $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways for persistent delays on its east coast routes. Half of the fine would be distributed as compensation to affected passengers. This marks the first instance of an airline being fined for chronic delays on specific routes, which the department attributed to JetBlue’s “unrealistic scheduling,” the agency said.Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg criticised the airline, stating, “Illegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today’s action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality.”JetBlue, however, shifted part of the blame onto the government’s air traffic control system .Spokesperson Derek Dombrowski said the airline had invested “tens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays” caused by air traffic control challenges in key markets, including the Northeast and Florida which led to improved on-time performance in 2024, especially during peak summer travel.Dombrowski called the incoming Trump administration to modernise outdated air traffic control systems and address staffing shortages among controllers.The department identified chronic delays on JetBlue flights between June 2022 and November 2023. Problematic routes included flights from New York’s JFK Airport to Raleigh-Durham, Fort Lauderdale, and Orlando, as well as flights from Windsor Locks, Connecticut, to Fort Lauderdale.JetBlue has since agreed to a settlement over delays on four specific routes.“While we’ve reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four (routes) in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the US government, which operates our nation’s air traffic control system,” Dombrowski revealed.Under the regulations set by the transportation department, airlines must not publish unrealistic schedules, ensuring departure and arrival times reflect operational realities. A flight is deemed chronically delayed if it operates at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late in over half of those instances.","The US transportation department has imposed a $2 million penalty on JetBlue Airways for persistent delays on its east coast routes.

Investments by companies owned by Elon Musk don’t represent a threat to Italy, according to Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni .“I work to have major investments in Italy and evaluate the usefulness of each investment through the prism of our national interest,” the premier told Corriere della Sera in response to a question on risks to national security.Meloni’s ties to Musk, the world’s richest person, have created headlines in Italy, with the billionaire even bestowing an award on her in New York.At the same time, Musk has waded into the Italian political and business scene, at one point warning that the country needs to produce more children, and at another claiming phone carrier Telecom Italia SpA was obstructing a high-speed rollout by his Starlink Inc.Musk and Meloni have discussed investment opportunities in the space and artificial intelligence sectors, and Italy’s new regulatory framework grants foreign space companies permission to operate in the country.Meloni is “authentic, honest, truthful — and that can’t always be said about politicians,” Musk said during the award ceremony in September.The appreciation appears to be mutual, with the premier telling Corriere that Musk is “like a genius” who’s been depicted “as a monster only because he’s chosen the ‘wrong’ side” politically.Other European politicians have been less upbeat on Musk, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his deputy, Robert Habeck, using their New Year addresses this week to castigate him over his backing for a far-right party in February’s snap election.Musk, a key figure in President-elect Donald Trump ’s transition team, will have a top advisory role in the new US government.","Giorgia Meloni’s ties to Musk have created headlines in Italy, with the billionaire even bestowing an award on her in New York.

What Bloomberg strategists are saying...

While the notable absence of a Santa Rally has previously led to a rebound in stocks for the month of January, the year’s first trading day doesn’t offer a great signal for the whole 12-month period. Over the past four years, for example, it has actually been a contrarian indicator, Deutsche Bank notes. The S&P 500 ended the year inversely of how it started.

Extending that analysis back to 1928, the year’s first trading day and the SPX’s annual performance have a poor correlation and have only moved in tandem ~50% of the time.

Euro bludgeoned

Major US benchmarks extended a selloff for a fifth day, shaving more than a trillion dollars from share prices. A pair of deadly attacks compounded market angst, starting the first trading day of the year on a dour note.An early rally collapsed driving the Nasdaq 100 down more than 1%.

It’s a call echoed by others on Wall Street , including Bank of America Corp.’s Savita Subramanian.As for the grim slide in the final days of 2024, it’s “too soon to call it a bad omen,” Shalett told Bloomberg Television.Treasuries erased gains after a reading of weekly jobless claims fell to an eight-month low. A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar’s strength traded at a more than two-year peak.Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius noted that “seasonal adjustment challenges can make jobless claims readings particularly volatile around the holiday season.”US stocks had been straining to snap a losing streak that took some shine off the S&P 500’s best two-year run dating back to the late 1990s.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing that incident as well as the deadly explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside of Trump’s hotel in Las Vegas.A shooting overnight at a nightclub in New York City only added to the anxiety, while authorities said it wasn’t related to terrorism.CBOE’s gauge of Wall Street stock sentiment, the VIX, touched 19.

Tussle with rival companies

Divided outlook

For the first time in at least nine years, Tesla's global annual sales have recorded a decline, dropping by 1.1 per cent compared to 2023. The electric vehicle (EV) giant delivered 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, a slight decrease from the 1.81 million sold the previous year.A 2.3 per cent hike in fourth-quarter sales, reaching 495,570 vehicles, was insufficient to offset a sluggish start to the year, despite incentives like 0 per cent financing, free charging, and affordable lease options.This decline is primarily attributed to waning demand for electric vehicles in the US and other markets. Analysts suggest that many early adopters have already purchased EVs, while mainstream buyers remain cautious about factors such as driving range, price, and access to charging stations for longer trips.Tesla’s fourth-quarter sales also fell short of Wall Street estimates, with analysts expecting 498,000 deliveries. Production figures revealed similar challenges, with 459,445 vehicles produced in the quarter and 1.77 million for the year, both falling slightly below the year's total deliveries.Adding to Tesla's concerns, the average sales price of its vehicles is estimated to have dropped to just over $41,000 in the fourth quarter, the lowest in at least four years, according to analysts polled by FactSet. This pricing pressure, coupled with once-unheard-of discounts, has weighed on Tesla’s industry-leading profit margins.The dip in sales challenges Tesla’s 2022 prediction of 50 per cent annual growth, as the company faces an ageing model lineup and increased competition from legacy automakers and startups in China, Europe, and the US. Nearly all of Tesla's sales came from its smaller, more affordable Models 3 and Y, with just 23,640 deliveries of its higher-end Model X, Model S, and the new Cybertruck.Meanwhile, Chinese rival BYD is closing in on Tesla’s lead as the world’s top EV seller, reporting a 41 per cent increase in sales to 1.77 million EVs in 2024. Tesla narrowly maintained its edge, but the competition underscores the mounting pressure on the Austin, Texas-based company.Tesla shares dropped nearly 7 per cent on Thursday following the announcement. However, the stock remains up more than 50 per cent over the past year, driven partly by optimism surrounding Tesla’s advancements in AI-powered autonomous driving technology and the prospect of regulatory easing under Donald Trump's re-election.Industry analysts remain divided on Tesla’s outlook. Daniel Ives of Wedbush remains bullish, ""We have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,"" he said in a report, adding, ""and the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.""William Stein, an analyst at Truist Securities, told news agency AP, that Tesla will struggle to sell vehicles in future months and expects further discounting used to boost sales will weigh on its financial results.Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for 29 January, will be closely watched by investors and analysts seeking clarity on how the company plans to navigate intensifying competition and demand challenges in the evolving EV market.","Tesla delivered 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, a slight decrease from the 1.81 million sold the previous year.

As we bid farewell to 2024 and step into 2025, the cryptocurrency landscape is reflecting on the remarkable trends and shifts that shaped the year. The market has been buzzing with discussions surrounding five standout cryptocurrencies: Solana (SOL), XRP, Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Rexas Finance (RXS). These tokens have captured attention due to their distinctive features, dynamic market movements, and promising growth potential. With the dawn of 2025, speculation is mounting about how these coins will fare in the upcoming market cycle and whether they will maintain their momentum or face new challenges.Solana continues to maintain a robust position in the market, trading at an average of $181.88 with a market cap of $87.2 billion. Its strong investor sentiment, coupled with a technical pattern signaling bullish momentum, has positioned it for further growth. Analysts forecast SOL to target a range between $156.33 and $211.22 by 2025, with the possibility of exceeding $264 if market confidence strengthens. This outlook is supported by Solana’s consistent performance and high transaction volumes, suggesting it remains a cornerstone for decentralized applications.XRP has emerged as one of the most discussed tokens of 2024. Despite losing nearly 20% from its December peak, it remains over 320% higher than its November low. On-chain data shows a significant rise in wallet activity, indicating strong community interest. Market analysts are optimistic about XRP’s potential, particularly as its charts display signs of a bullish resurgence. As institutional adoption increases, XRP is set to capitalize on its ledger's efficiency, reinforcing its relevance in cross-border transactions.Dogecoin’s price trajectory reflects a history of exponential growth during bullish cycles. Analysts note that DOGE has repeatedly surpassed key Fibonacci levels, and its ongoing symmetrical triangle pattern suggests a breakout may be imminent. With projections placing DOGE at $2.28 or higher, it could rank among the top three assets by market cap. The community-driven nature of DOGE continues to bolster its appeal, ensuring its position as a favorite in the crypto market.Cardano experienced a challenging year with a 9% weekly decline, but its price downtrend shows signs of stabilising. Whale activity has steadied, reducing selling pressure and pointing toward a consolidation phase. The $0.859 support level remains critical for ADA’s recovery, with potential to reclaim $1 in the coming months. Cardano’s innovative blockchain solutions and commitment to scalability make it a long-term contender, even amidst market fluctuations.Rexas Finance (RXS) has reshaped the crypto market through its focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation.

Chinese stocks tumble in worst start to a year since 2016,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-stocks-tumble-in-worst-start-to-a-year-since-2016/articleshow/116880502.cms,"Traders may want to limit China exposure in their portfolios as they position for 2025. (Representative picture)

Chinese stocks posted their worst start to a year in nearly a decade as investors braced for economic uncertainties with weaker-than-expected manufacturing data and an anticipated hike in tariffs.The CSI 300 Index closed down 2.9% on Thursday, its steepest drop on a year’s first day of trading since 2016. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid as much as 3.1%.The losses suggest sentiment remains fragile even after Chinese equities posted their first annual advance last year since 2020. There’s a lack of confidence over the country’s economic recovery, with the Caixin manufacturing survey coming in below estimates and Donald Trump ’s threat of higher tariffs looming large ahead of his inauguration later this month.A sharp fall in the CSI 300 in the last trading session of 2024 also pushed the gauge below the 60-day moving average, a closely-watched technical threshold, likely leading to further selling by some funds. Several large financial stocks including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China traded ex-dividend, exacerbating the benchmarks’ losses.China Stocks Slump on Data, Support Level Breach“It’s a bit troubling that investors are starting the new year in a cautious mode as this is happening after clearer stimulus signals from Beijing during its December policy meetings,” said Homin Lee, senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier. “The underlying momentum for China remains quite fragile, and it will take some efforts from the authorities to change the conversation on the country’s medium-term deflationary dangers.”While Chinese stocks rose 15% last year in a rare annual gain, a bulk of the increase came in the weeks following a late September stimulus blitz. The market has since been trading range-bound, with investors waiting for more significant stimulus to drive the market higher.Following the Central Economic Work Conference in December, China signaled more public borrowing and spending in 2025 with a shift of policy focus to consumption, in an effort to repair the economy’s weak link as looming US tariffs threaten exports.While that announcement has given investors hope that Beijing is determined to revive the economy, some market watchers note that there will be a lull in stimulus until March when the so-called Two Sessions — China’s annual legislative session — take place.Traders may want to limit China exposure in their portfolios as they position for 2025, according to Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.Global funds had already turned net sellers of Chinese stocks in November following two months of net inflows, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note dated December 4. Passive funds turned to outflows after heavy inflows in October while active funds accelerated net outflows in November, they wrote.As economic concerns linger, China’s 10-year bond yields hit a fresh record low on Thursday. The People’s Bank of China injected massive liquidity into the market at the end of 2024 without using high-profile stimulus, as officials preserve policy space before Trump returns to office.Equity trading volume was notable in Hong Kong on Thursday as markets reopened after a holiday, with that for the Hang Seng Index 50% larger than the average over the past 30 sessions. Meanwhile, turnover in Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses has remained below 1.5 trillion yuan ($206 billion) in recent days, suggesting traders are opting to remain on the sidelines until catalysts become clear.“The losses today look very much trading driven, as there was a bit of accumulated gains that would have prompted selling with the breach of technicals,” said Liu Dejun, fund manager at Beijing Kaiyuan Private Fund Management Co. “Many are also talking about avoiding too much stock exposure ahead of Trump’s inauguration, which is close to the Lunar New Year holidays.”","The CSI 300 Index closed down 2.9% on Thursday, its steepest drop on a year’s first day of trading since 2016. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid as much as 3.1%. The losses suggest sentiment remains fragile even after Chinese equities posted their first annual advance last year since 2020.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116880524,imgsize-1084845,width-400,resizemode-4/116880524.jpg"

Shiba Inu is one of the trending meme coins, following a 24-hour increase of nearly 4%. While this may seem like a drop from the massive promises that SHIB holds, it’s crucial to note that the SHIB price is coming from a low point of -10.23% in the past month. Similarly, Stellar (XLM) has been on the road to rediscovery after a pause in its growth.However, the Lunex presale has been a success so far, raising over $5.6 million in a few months. The Lunex project has been attracting meme coin investors. Let’s find out why.The SHIB price has been down by about 11% in the past month, with a price of $0.000023 at the time of writing. The dip in the meme coin’s price comes after a massive decline hit the broader crypto market, causing pessimistic Shiba Inu news among investors.Nonetheless, SHIB investors can find solace in its cumulative 113% growth in the past 12 months and get confidence from the coin’s recent bounce back. The SHIB price has gone up by almost 4% in the last 24 hours alone. According to the latest Shiba Inu news, the recent turnaround is a result of the recent post by Elon Musk, which showed a SHIB-like creature hovering over a city.Another coin that has been regaining bullish trends after a period of decline is XLM. Following a year-to-date of over 200%, the XLM price has dropped by nearly 30% in the past month. The drop in the XLM price has caused uncertainty among investors, as there have been sharp price rises and falls.However, a 24-hour surge in the XLM price raises speculation that the token may be regaining momentum. The XLM price has surged by over 4% in the last 24 hours alone. The same applies to the coin’s market cap, which suggested that the Stellar break could be over. However, another sharp fall could be in the offing.While established altcoins like SHIB and XLM have been experiencing a mix of sharp uptrends and downtrends, new altcoins like Lunex have been growing steadily during their presales. For instance, the Lunex price has increased across various levels of its presale and is currently trading at $0.0049. The low Lunex price is a bargain for investors, who are driving the token’s growth in the altcoin market.The interest in the Lunex project stems from the various features that set it apart in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The cross-chain Web3 platform allows the seamless flow of assets across multiple blockchains and over 50,000 crypto pairs. Its non-custodial blockchain operations also make asset exchange faster, cheaper, and more efficient.Moreover, Lunex users can leverage its non-custodial crypto wallet , which helps traders store, manage, and trade over 40,000 digital assets within a single mobile app. Plus, Lunex token holders can earn passive income by staking their assets in the platform’s liquidity pool . With up to 18% APY up for grabs, the staking feature provides a rewarding investment opportunity. There’s also a Lunex reward program, which rewards traders with cashback offers on every transaction they complete on the cross-chain platform .","Shiba Inu is one of the trending meme coins, following a 24-hour increase of nearly 4%.

Xi Jinping: China’s 2024 GDP growth set to hit target of around 5%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/xi-jinping-chinas-2024-gdp-growth-set-to-hit-target-of-around-5/articleshow/116835200.cms,"Xi signaled that support for the economy will continue into 2025.

Weak demand

Monetary easing

China’s gross domestic product is expected to expand around 5% for the full year of 2024, President Xi Jinping said, signaling the world’s second-largest economy is on track to meet its official target.China’s economy was “overall stable and progressing amid stability,” Xi said at a new year event on Tuesday, according to a speech published by the official Xinhua News Agency. Risks in key areas were effectively addressed, while employment and prices remained steady, he said.While a precise figure won’t be available until next month, the Chinese leader’s disclosure capped off a year of economic uncertainty, with the growth goal initially seen as a “target without a plan.” The outlook for 2024 improved after policymakers rolled out a slew of stimulus steps since late September, with economists now forecasting an expansion of 4.8% this year.Xi signaled that support for the economy will continue into 2025 during the New Year’s Eve remarks to the nation’s top political advisory body, reiterating a call to adopt more proactive macroeconomic policies.Later in the day in another new year address televised nationally, Xi acknowledged challenges facing China’s economy, including external uncertainties and shifting to new growth drivers, but called on the nation to remain confident in overcoming them.“In 2025, we will fully complete the 14th Five-Year Plan, implement more proactive and effective policies,” Xi said. “As always, we grow in wind and rain, and we get stronger through hard times. We must be full of confidence.”As in previous years, Xi also used his speech to reiterate the ruling Communist Party’s position on Taiwan. “No one can ever stop China’s reunification,” he said, alluding to Beijing’s longtime vow to bring the self-ruled island under its control, by force if necessary.China is expected to set a 2025 growth target roughly similar to this year’s, as top leaders signaled earlier this month they’re willing to embrace more forceful stimulus measures. That would help the economy counter any impact from potential increases in US tariffs after President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House next month.An official GDP growth target would only be revealed in March, when annual legislative sessions are held. Chinese leaders plan to set an annual growth goal of about 5% for next year, Reuters reported earlier. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimate 4.5% growth in 2025.Officials at key meetings in December pledged to use greater public borrowing and spending as well as monetary easing to spur growth in 2025, in an unusually direct call that sought to boost confidence. They endorsed the first shift in monetary policy stance in 14 years to a “moderately loose” one.But the economy is still weighed by weak domestic demand and an uncertain outlook for exports, which has been a key growth driver this year. Deflation is likely to persist well into next year, while the property market is still slumping.Beijing’s initial stimulus next year is expected to fall short of the kind of radical action analysts believe is required to stem the downward spiral in prices, but officials may step up support later when growth falters just as they did this year.Previously, Premier Li Qiang also revealed the nation’s growth rate ahead of an official announcement by the statistics bureau in a step to lift sentiment. He said the economy grew 5.2% in 2023 in Davos last January, while highlighting the fact that China did not resort to massive stimulus.China’s next easing step could come from the People’s Bank of China, which has yet to provide a liquidity boost to markets by cutting the amount of cash banks must hold in reserves — a move it previously flagged as possible by the end of 2024.PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng in October said the central bank may lower the reverse requirement ratio by 25 to 50 basis points depending on liquidity conditions by the year’s end. China’s top leaders at a key economic meeting in December also vowed to trim the RRR at an “appropriate time,” without providing more details.The PBOC’s decision likely took into consideration the need to stabilize the yuan. High-profile easing measures like a RRR cut could add to depreciation pressure on the yuan. That’s because it would worsen yuan assets’ yield disadvantage compared with dollar assets, triggering fund outflows. The yuan declined to its one-year low in December.The central bank likely withheld the RRR cut partly because the Federal Reserve signaled greater caution over how quickly it will lower interest rates, according to Bruce Pang, distinguished senior research fellow at the National Institution for Finance and Development, a think tank. The next window for a RRR cut could be after Trump takes office as US president on Jan. 20, he said.“The PBOC is preserving policy space to deal with increasing external uncertainties. Injecting too much liquidity could also make it harder to manage the yuan exchange rate and government bond yield,” he said.Liquidity in the interbank market remains ample for now, in spite of a seasonal rise in cash demand at the year-end period. The cost for top-rated commercial banks to raise funds from other institutions via one-year debt instruments hovered at the lowest since April 2020 at the end of December. Subdued loan demand may leave cash sitting idle in the banking system.PBOC is likely to lower the RRR in January before the Lunar New Year holiday — which begins Jan. 28 — if it doesn’t cut in December, according to analysts including Liu Yu at Huaxi Securities. Over the next year, the PBOC is expected to provide long-term liquidity by cutting the RRR and buying more government bonds.","China’s gross domestic product is expected to expand around 5% for the full year of 2024, President Xi Jinping said.

1.14 lakh startups generate more than 12 lakh jobs in India: Finance ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/trend-tracking/1-14-lakh-startups-generate-more-than-12-lakh-jobs-in-india-finance-ministry/articleshow/107262154.cms,"Finance Ministry

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy .In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

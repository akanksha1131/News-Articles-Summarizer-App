India is BA’s second-largest market

Network expansion and partnerships

Strong India–UK travel corridor

British Airways is preparing to expand its India operations to enter country’s fast-growing aviation market and rising outbound travel demand, a senior airline executive said, citing the country's ""incredible potential"".The carrier, which has been flying to India for more than a century, currently operates 56 weekly flights from Indian cities to London — three daily services from Mumbai, two from Delhi, and one each from Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai.Subject to regulatory approvals, British Airways plans to add a third daily Delhi–London flight next year.“We are always looking to continue to expand our services as demand grows stronger. We continue to keep our network schedule under constant review to ensure we provide connectivity and choice for our customers,” British Airways Chief Operating Officer Rene de Groot told PTI.“As demand strengthens, we remain focused on expanding our services and elevating the travel experience,” he added.India is now British Airways’ second-biggest market after the US, with the airline maintaining crew bases in all five Indian cities it serves.De Groot said local hiring remains central to the airline’s service proposition.“In India, we continue to create employment opportunities, and support regional economies — all while promoting the best of Britain,” he said.British Airways also runs CallBA, its India contact centre located in Gurugram, which employs around 2,000 staff offering round-the-clock assistance to customers across the US, Europe and Asia-Pacific.“From a people perspective, we have invested heavily in India and steadily expanded our colleague presence here, with CallBA and our five Indian cabin crew bases growing in size,” De Groot noted.The airline maintains a codeshare partnership with IndiGo and, through its wider collaboration with Qatar Airways, serves 13 Indian destinations with a total of 148 weekly flights — including direct British Airways services from London and Qatar Airways connections via Doha.Earlier this year, the airline launched a Meet and Assist service for travellers needing extra support while flying from India to the UK.De Groot said the rapid expansion of Indian carriers is a positive sign for the market.“We view the dynamic growth of Indian carriers like IndiGo and Air India as a positive development for the aviation industry and for India’s emergence as a global aviation hub,” he also told PTI.“India is our second-largest market, and the rising demand, coupled with the expansion of carriers like IndiGo amongst others, reflects the incredible potential of this market.”The UK remains a preferred destination for Indian travellers — particularly for tourism and education — aided by the India–UK Free Trade Agreement. About 500,000 Indians visit the UK each year, and the Indian diaspora continues to be a strong driver of travel demand.","India is BA’s second-largest market after the US.

New labour codes: Indian companies face higher wage expenses; manpower costs may increase 5-15% across sectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-labour-codes-indian-companies-face-higher-wage-expenses-manpower-costs-may-increase-5-15-across-sectors/articleshow/125654580.cms,"An AI-generated image

Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

Companies review hiring and pay structures

Indian companies are likely to see higher wage bills as they adjust HR policies and compensation structures to comply with the new four labour codes. Experts estimate manpower costs could rise 5-10%, or even more for some firms.The increase in wage expenses is largely driven by higher costs for benefits such as gratuity, overtime, bonuses, and leave encashment, which will now be calculated according to the new wage definition, said Sonu Iyer, national leader, people advisory services – tax at EY India. Labour-intensive sectors like manufacturing, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and companies with fragmented pay structures are likely to experience the steepest increases.Firms where variable pay and allowances make up a significant part of total compensation may see only moderate rises, said Viswanath PS, chief executive at Randstad India. ""In such cases, a 5-10% increase in manpower cost is a reasonable estimate, though the exact impact will vary by industry and the current compensation design,"" he said, as quoted by ET.Companies are also reassessing hiring models, particularly the mix between contract and fixed-term employment, while realigning salary structures to comply with the uniform wage definition, experts noted.""As remuneration in kind (if any) up to 15% will be treated as wages, all employers will now need to re-examine what components of their current compensation structures will be treated as 'wages,' and which ones will be excluded from the definition,"" said Atul Gupta, partner – labour and employment practice at Trilegal. He added that gratuity is likely to see the most significant impact among employee benefits.""An increase in manpower costs on account of the recent labour codes may go up in the 5-12% range for a typical organised employer. And if the workforce was over indexed on allowances or contract labour, it may be 10-15%, or more,"" said Prabir Jha, founder and CEO of Prabir Jha People Advisory.Highlighting the employee perspective, Sudhakar Sethuraman, partner at Deloitte India, said, ""The codes specifically prohibit the employer from reducing the wages of the employees…So employees stand to gain from labour codes,"" as quoted by ET.The government, however, believes that the significant reduction in compliance burdens under the new codes will balance out any additional employer costs, including those arising from overtime payments or mandatory health checks for workers.","Indian companies are likely to see higher wage bills as they adjust HR policies and compensation structures to comply with the new four labour codes.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Tuesday on weak global cues. While Nifty50 was above 26,150, BSE Sensex was near 85,500. At 9:24 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,152.25, down 24 points or 0.090%. BSE Sensex was at 85,523.64, down 118 points or 0.14%.Markets have been taking a breather with profit booking in focus after hitting recent record highs.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “It appears that the market is consolidating around the new record highs before breaking out to new highs. There is fundamental support for newer highs as reflected in the robust GDP numbers and the leading indicators like auto sales in November. The continuing weakness in the rupee is a dampener which is impacting FII flows. A fair trade deal between India and the US can stem the weakness in rupee, but this has been hanging fire for too long. ”“Investors can use the current period of consolidation to slowly accumulate fairly-valued largecaps and growth-oriented midcaps which will lead the next leg of rally in the market. The Smallcap segment continues to be over-valued.The Bank Nifty, despite the recent run up, has the potential to impart resilience to the market since there is valuation comfort in this segment. The pick up in credit growth is another positive for the segment. ”Asian equities showed modest gains at opening, attempting recovery following Monday's decline, where cryptocurrency losses led the broader market downturn.American stocks dipped on Monday, affected by rising Treasury yields and manufacturing sector data showing tariff impacts, as traders awaited the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy statement next week.Gold prices decreased in early Asian trading on Tuesday, following its six-week high in the previous session, with profit-taking evident whilst investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair's comments and crucial economic indicators for interest rate guidance.Oil prices increased early Tuesday for the second straight session as traders evaluated risks from Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian energy facilities and growing US-Venezuela tensions.Foreign institutional investors sold net shares worth Rs 1,171.31 crore on Monday.

"Starbucks settlement: Coffee chain to pay $35 mn to 15,000 NYC workers; Mamdani and others join striking baristas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/starbucks-settlement-coffee-chain-to-pay-35-mn-to-15000-nyc-workers-mamdani-and-others-join-striking-baristas/articleshow/125708715.cms,"Starbucks, one of the world’s biggest coffee chains, has finally agreed to hand over about $35 million to more than 15,000 New York City workers after claims that shifts were slashed without warning and schedules kept in constant flux. The announcement landed on Monday, just hours before Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and US Senator Bernie Sanders walked onto a Brooklyn picket line to visit protesting baristas.The settlement comes in the middle of a union-led strike that began last month across dozens of stores nationwide. Workers argued that their demands are simple: better staffing and more stable hours. But frustration only grew as almost four years passed since baristas at a Buffalo branch first came together to strike against the organisation, and a contract has still not materialised. Since then, unionisation has spread to around 550 of Starbucks’ 10,000 company-owned outlets. A further 7,000 stores operate under licence in airports, supermarkets and other venues.Both the company and union workers dispute the scale of the strike’s impact. Even so, Mamdani, Sanders and a group of state and city officials added political firepower to the movement on Monday, joining scores of baristas and supporters outside a Brooklyn Starbucks.“These are not demands of greed — these are demands of decency,” Mamdani said. Some workers held oversized cut-outs of Starbucks takeaway cups, swapping the company’s branding with the union’s. Sanders said, “Starbucks has refused to sit down and negotiate a fair contract.”Strikers described a workplace buckling under pressure, understaffed shifts, unpredictable scheduling and online orders so complex that the list of ingredients sometimes stretches beyond the height of the cup. “It is the company's issue to give us the labor amount to schedule partners fairly, and they are not scheduling us fairly, no matter how much money we are making them,” said Gabriel Pierre, 26, a shift supervisor at a suburban Bellmore shop.Meanwhile, the Seattle-based chain has been trying to regain its financial footing. Cost-conscious customers have been pressing pause on premium coffees, questioning whether they still justify the price. Starbucks recently recorded its first rise in same-store sales in nearly two years, but restructuring costs, store redesigns and other changes dragged on profits in the July–September quarter.The settlement announced by New York City’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection further requires Starbucks to pay $3.4 million in civil penalties in addition to the $35 million earmarked for workers. Additionally, the company agreed to follow the city’s Fair Workweek law from here on.Starbucks said that it is committed to responsible operations and compliance with local laws, while acknowledging the difficulty of the rules in question. “This is notoriously challenging to manage,"" spokesperson Jaci Anderson said.Most hourly employees affected will receive $50 for each week worked between July 2021 and July 2024, the department confirmed. Staff who experienced violations after that window can still seek compensation by filing a complaint.The deal also guarantees reinstatement opportunities for employees laid off during recent store closures in the city.For many baristas, the fight continues. “I sure hope that it gives Starbucks an awakening,” said Kaari Harsila, 21, a shift supervisor from Brooklyn who joined the picket line.",The settlement comes in the middle of a union-led strike that began last month across dozens of stores nationwide.

HSBC has a buy on GAIL with the target price at Rs 235. Analysts said that the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulator Board (PNGRB) issued an interim order increasing pipeline tariff by 12% against GAIL’s demand for 33%, with the final order deferred to 2028. While this order disappointed investors in near term, analysts believe smoother transition will ensure both volume and value growth. They said that the downside risks include a steep fall in marketing margins and a sharp rise in LNG prices, which could reduce its demand in the Indian market.Jefferies has a buy rating on Kfin Tech with the target price at Rs 1,460. Analysts said that the company’s management was positive on pricing trends that should aid healthy growth in revenues from mutual funds. The management also said that the issuer solutions segment was growing well. The company also said that its international revenue growth can pick up from April-June of 2026 (Q1FY27) as monetisation of client wins improves. Analysts also said that Kfin Tech’s efforts to integrate Ascent is moving well and margins can expandCitigroup has a sell rating on Laurus Laboratories with the target price at Rs 590. Analysts said that the company has aggressive capex plans, to spend Rs 1,000 crore annually over the next few years.Its orderbook is healthy from existing customers, without even including new customers. They also said that the company’s contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) sales should improve from about 30% of its revenues to about 50% over the next five years. The company is building capacities in new segments like peptides, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).Kotak Institutional Equities has a buy rating on Swiggy with the target price at Rs 450. Analysts said that at the current market price of Rs 378, they believe Swiggy’s stock price is imputing Rs 360/share of value for food delivery + cash/investments, with only Rs 18/share or Rs 4,500 crore of valuation being ascribed to Instamart. They said that the recent price checks on the Swiggy app indicate that the company is slowly weaning customers away from discounts, although it remains to be seen if it can simultaneously scale up orders per store. Analysts said that the quick commerce competitive intensity remains high though Swiggy’s average order value (AOV) improvement should drive gradual improvement in unit economics.Goldman Sachs has a neutral rating on Jubilant Foodworks with the target price at Rs 650. Analysts said that the company was confident of 5-7% like-for-like growth, multiple levers for margin expansion and free cash flow. They said that the Domino's business can expand to 1,200 cities in the long term.

MUMBAI: Complaints against credit information companies have almost quadrupled in three years, signalling growing frustration among borrowers over credit scores and data accuracy. This surge stands out in the wider trend of rising grievances handled by India's financial ombudsman.CIC complaints rose from 1,039 in 2022-23 to 3,847 in 2023-24 and further to 4,585 in 2024-25, marking the sharpest escalation among regulated entities.

Banks remained the biggest contributors, with complaint volumes climbing sharply in FY24 before stabilising at 2,41,601 in 2024-25.

US markets today: Wall Street falls as Bitcoin sinks; manufacturing slowdown and tariff pressures deepen concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-markets-today-wall-street-falls-as-bitcoin-sinks-manufacturing-slowdown-and-tariff-pressures-deepen-concerns/articleshow/125699059.cms,".

US markets moved lower on Monday, giving back part of last week’s gains as bitcoin and other once-popular assets continued to weaken. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% in morning trading, putting its five-day winning run at risk. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 204 points, also 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite edged down 0.5%.Earlier rally had been fueled by optimism that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates at its meeting next week to support a cooling labor market. Those expectations remain strong, with CME Group data showing traders see almost an 88% chance of a rate cut, reported AP.Even so, yields on long-term US government bonds moved higher. This followed a rise in global yields after the Bank of Japan’s chief suggested that interest rates there could increase. When bond yields rise, they often draw investors away from riskier markets, putting pressure on stocks and cryptocurrencies in particular.Bitcoin, which had been around $125,000 in October, slid below $86,000 — a 5% more drop than yesterday. The decline weighed on crypto-linked companies: Coinbase Global fell 3.7% and Robinhood Markets dropped 4.6%.Strategy, previously known as MicroStrategy, tumbled 8% after saying it had raised $1.44 billion in US dollars through stock sales to help cover dividends on preferred shares and pay interest on its debt.Synopsys was among the strongest performers, rising 3.9% after revealing that Nvidia will invest $2 billion in the company as part of a deepened partnership. Nvidia, now the most influential stock on Wall Street, recovered from early losses to close 0.9% higher.Investors also reacted to early reports from the holiday shopping weekend. Spending during Black Friday and Cyber Monday appeared to exceed projections despite ongoing concerns about the broader US economy. Amazon inched up 0.4%, while Best Buy slipped 1.9%.Global markets showed mixed results. France’s CAC 40 index eased 0.3%, partly due to a 5.1% decline in Airbus. The company said that most of its 6,000 A320 aircraft had been updated after a software issue discovered over the weekend that could affect flight controls. Airlines faced minor disruptions as they rushed to apply the fix during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.In Japan, the Nikkei 225 dropped 1.9% amid worries that the country’s long-standing near-zero interest rates may soon rise as inflation remains above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target.In the US, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 4.08% from 4.02% at the end of last week. It briefly went past 4.09% before easing after a report showed US factory activity declined more than expected. Manufacturers reported weak hiring conditions and said they are “still more focused on managing headcount than on hiring,” as quoted by AP.Several companies also mentioned ongoing challenges related to tariffs, with one saying, “Conditions are more trying than during the coronavirus pandemic in terms of supply chain uncertainty.”","The S&P 500 was down 0.4% in morning trading, putting its five-day winning run at risk.

Bitcoin fell sharply on Monday, slipping below $86,000 in early Asian trade as renewed selling hit the cryptocurrency market at the start of December.The world’s largest digital asset dropped by 6%. Ether also declined more than 7% to around $2,800, while other major tokens, including Solana also registered steep losses. Traders said that the broader slump signals a fresh risk-off mood among investors, according to a report by Bloomberg.The crypto market has been struggling since a wave of leveraged positions. The market worth nearly $19 billion was wiped out in early October, shortly after Bitcoin touched a record high of $126,251. The token shed nearly 17% in November, although a brief recovery last week had lifted prices above $90,000.“It’s a risk-off start to December,” said Sean McNulty, APAC derivatives trading lead at FalconX.“The biggest concern is the meager inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and absence of dip buyers. We expect the structural headwinds to continue this month. We are watching $80,000 on Bitcoin as the next key support level,” McNulty added.Sentiment weakened further after comments from Strategy Inc. CEO Phong Le, who said the company could sell some of its massive Bitcoin holdings if required to support dividends.Strategy holds about $56 billion worth of Bitcoin.Adding to market jitters, S&P Global Ratings last week downgraded its stability assessment of USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, citing the risk of under-collateralization if Bitcoin prices continue to fall.Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China issued fresh warnings over the risks of virtual currencies and urged tighter action against illegal crypto activities.Market participants are now watching key US economic data due this week, which could influence expectations on future interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.US President Donald Trump on Sunday said that he had finalized his choice for the next Fed chair, fueling further speculation over policy direction in 2026.Crypto traders caution that volatility may remain high in the near term as global financial markets react to shifting rate expectations and regulatory signals.","The world’s largest digital asset dropped by 6%.

Stock markets in Asia opened on a steady note on Monday as optimism over a possible US interest rate cut supported risk appetite at the start of the final month of 2025.Investors also kept a close watch on the Japanese yen, which strengthened amid expectations of a near-term policy shift in Tokyo.The yen advanced to 155.64 per US dollar as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda delivered a speech in Nagoya. Ueda said the central bank would weigh the “pros and cons” of raising interest rates at its next policy meeting in December, a comment that investors parsed for signals on the timing of a long-awaited hike.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was steady at 703.19, up 23.5% so far this year and on track for its strongest annual performance since 2017. Japan’s Nikkei, however, slipped 1.3% in early trading.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index climbed more than 1%, helping support broader Asian stocks, though US futures traded lower during Asian hours.“The risk bulls roll into December feeling positive about directional bias,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone. As earlier concerns faded, he said, investors were now driven by the fear of missing out and underperforming benchmarks.Markets will be guided this week by US economic releases on manufacturing, services and consumer sentiment. Analysts say volatility could rise as traders weigh whether the economy is cooling without slipping into recession.“With the US data void finally being filled and a busy economic calendar ahead, December looks set to be a merry one for volatility hunters,” said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at StoneX in Brisbane.He added that a controlled slowdown would likely keep sentiment upbeat while weakening the US dollar, which typically softens at year-end.The dollar index was little changed at 99.414, after falling 8% so far this year, most of the losses coming in early 2025.Investors will also track remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later on Monday, as dovish signals have increased confidence that a rate cut could come this month. Traders are now pricing an 87% probability of a cut.Holiday shopping trends remain another key indicator. US online spending on Black Friday hit a record $11.8 billion, up 9.1% from last year, according to Adobe Analytics.In commodities, oil prices rose after OPEC+ decided to keep output unchanged for the first quarter of 2026 amid worries about a potential supply glut. Brent crude futures gained 1% to $63.03 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude added 0.99% to $59.16.Meanwhile, Japan’s finance minister issued yet another warning against sharp foreign-exchange swings, saying recent yen moves were “clearly not driven by fundamentals.”Authorities have struggled to slow the currency’s slide as traders weigh doubts over the timing of the next rate hike and fiscal risks under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was steady at 703.19.

A history of dramatic and contested predictions

Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has reignited debate over his long-running market warnings after posting on X that “the biggest crash in history” has already begun. His message paints a picture of an economy under pressure from rapid technological change and widening global instability. Citing an AI-driven erosion of jobs and deepening stress in real estate markets, Kiyosaki argues that the financial landscape is shifting far faster than most expect, and that only those who prepare for a more turbulent era will be able to shield themselves from the heavy losses he believes lie ahead. In the latest post, he adds that the “best option” for investors is silver, while also urging them to consider gold during volatility.Kiyosaki’s latest message draws directly from his 2002 book Rich Dad’s Prophecy, reprinted in 2013, where he predicted a historic market meltdown. His new post links the downturn to artificial intelligence, claiming job losses across the US, Europe and Asia are now triggering the market spiral he warned about more than two decades ago. He maintains that silver remains the “best option” for investors looking to protect themselves.Silver prices have continued climbing. As of 29 November 2025, the metal sits at about $56.70 per ounce, a 13 percent increase from the $50 level Kiyosaki referenced on 23 November. Yet major market indicators tell a more measured story. The S&P 500 has dipped roughly 5 percent from recent highs, suggesting turbulence but not the total global crash Kiyosaki describes.Kiyosaki has made bold crash forecasts repeatedly, including several in 2025 that did not unfold as predicted. His latest warning has sparked scepticism and online pushback, with figures like Grant Cardone publicly dismissing the claims. Still, the post taps into a broader and unresolved debate over AI’s economic impact and whether today’s volatility is a temporary shock or the beginning of something far more severe.","Robert Kiyosaki has reignited debate over his long-running market warnings.

India Says US Trade Deal Is 'Only Matter Of Time' As Tariffs Reshape Bilateral Trade Negotiations

US President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his sweeping tariff regime, saying the duties had made the country “Rich, Strong, Powerful, and Safe,” in a post on his Truth Social account.Trump argued that because of the tariff framework he “set in place,” the United States now holds “all the cards,” asserting that the measures had stopped wars, strengthened alliances and prevented other nations from “ripping off the United States anymore.”He claimed the stock market and retirement savings had surged, adding that “Inflation, Prices and Taxes are down,” and that education was “being brought back to the States.”Trump also said the US military and southern border were “the strongest they have ever been,” contending that the country is “respected again, respected like never before.”He attributed these outcomes to what he described as “Strong leadership and tariffs.”The president’s remarks come at a sensitive moment, as the Supreme Court is preparing to rule on the extent of presidential authority to impose duties without congressional approval.Tariff revenues have climbed sharply in recent months, as per Fox Business, reaching a record $34.2 billion in October.Total duty collections were $215.2 billion in fiscal year 2025, and the Treasury has reported $41.6 billion in revenue so far in fiscal 2026.Since Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, collections jumped from $23.9 billion in May to $29 billion in July, with August and September together bringing in $62.6 billion, reported Fox Business.US businesses pay these import taxes but often pass on the costs to consumers, though Trump has recently lifted some duties to ease price pressures.Trump has pledged that tariff revenues could finance a one-time $2,000 dividend for low- and middle-income households.As per Fox Business, US trade representative Jamieson Greer recently said that the payments would not fuel inflation, stressing they would provide “welcome relief” without altering the broader economic outlook.Trump ended his post by urging Americans to “pray to God” that the Supreme Court “do the right thing for America.”","US President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his sweeping tariff regime.

Retailers say shoppers have grown more selective and deal-focused, even as they continue to spend on big seasonal moments, creating what executives describe as a “halo effect”.“Consumers have been saying the economy is terrible while continuing to spend for years now, so the outlook is probably better than they are telling us,” Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, said ahead of Black Friday.At Macy’s Herald Square in New York City, early-morning crowds searched for steep discounts on shoes, clothing, linens and cosmetics after doors opened at 6 a.m. Footwear — marked down by 40–50% — was among the busiest sections. But unlike in past years, the atmosphere was calm.Veronica Nam, 68, picked up Nike sneakers for her husband and spent $256 on Lacoste bedding she estimated was half-price.

The banking intern plans to spend around $1,200 this holiday season — roughly the same as last year. “I’m here to buy stuff. Shoes and clothes,” he said. “It’s a great tradition. The stores are open really early.”Retailers spent spring and summer navigating tariff unpredictability, shifting shipments ahead of import taxes and absorbing some costs to avoid raising prices. Circana data showed 40% of general merchandise in September saw price hikes of at least 5% versus early 2025. Toys, housewares, baby products and sports gear were especially affected; 83% of toys saw at least a 5% price rise. Nearly 80% of US toy sales involve items made in China — a sector hit with steep Trump-era tariffs.Still, malls and analysts reported strong momentum heading into Black Friday. At Minnesota’s Mall of America, foot traffic has exceeded 2019 pre-pandemic levels in recent weeks, said Jill Renslow, the mall’s chief business development and marketing officer. “We’re seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,” she said. “The last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.”Online spending is also growing briskly. Between Nov. 1 and Nov. 23, consumers spent $79.7 billion, Adobe Analytics said — up 7.5% from a year earlier and ahead of its 5.3% forecast.Mastercard SpendingPulse projects holiday sales from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24 will rise 3.6%, compared with last year’s 4.1%.“Clearly, there’s uncertainty,” Mastercard Chief Economist Michelle Meyer said. “Clearly, consumers feel on edge. But at the moment, it doesn’t seem like it’s changing how they are showing up for this season.”","Black Friday draws more in-store traffic than any other day of the year.

Canada’s economy staged a stronger-than-expected recovery in the third quarter of 2025, expanding 2.6 per cent year-on-year after a contraction in the previous quarter, according to new data from Statistics Canada, AFP reported.The rebound was fuelled by an improved trade balance and higher government spending, offsetting the drag from US President Donald Trump’s trade war, which has weighed on Canadian growth and clouded the country’s trade outlook.CIBC economist Katherine Judge said the print “was well above the consensus forecast,” noting that analysts had broadly expected growth of around 0.5 per cent.Statistics Canada said the improvement was led by declines in imports alongside a slight uptick in exports. “Imports dropped and exports edged up. Increased capital investment was driven by government capital spending, as business investment was flat,” the agency said.The drop in imports was the largest since 2022, the agency added.A sharp rise in federal outlays also contributed to the growth momentum, with government spending on weapons systems surging 82 per cent.

German chemical major Wacker Chemie on Thursday announced plans to cut 1,500 jobs, nearly a tenth of its global workforce, as the industry faces one of its toughest periods in decades.The company said most of the reductions will take place in Germany, with the process to be completed by the end of 2027, according to AFP.The job cuts form part of a broader plan to save more than 300 million euros ($348 million) annually. Wacker employs around 16,600 people worldwide, most of them based in Germany. Its customer base spans the automotive, construction and semiconductor sectors — all of which have been hit by slowing demand and rising competition.Shares of Wacker Chemie rose nearly 2 percent in Frankfurt after the announcement.Chief executive Christian Hartel said the operating environment for chemical firms in Germany needed urgent improvement. “The excessively high energy prices and bureaucratic obstacles continue to act as a central brake on the successful development of the chemical industry,” he said.The company had reported a net loss of more than 80 million euros in the third quarter, citing weak demand and mounting competition, particularly from China.Earlier this month, Germany’s VCI chemical industry association warned that production in the sector had slipped to a three-decade low, reflecting the broader strain on traditional industries as the country struggles to emerge from two years of recession.","Wacker Chemie announces plans to cut 1,500 jobs, nearly a tenth of its global workforce.

Hong Kong Fire Out Of Control: Over 100 Casualties, Hundreds Missing; 3 Held For Manslaughter

China Taiping's insurance exposure



'Seriously underinsured'

China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co. shares fell sharply on Thursday amid concerns over its exposure to a Hong Kong construction project linked to a devastating high-rise fire that has killed at least 44 people and left hundreds missing.The stock slid as much as 8.1% in early trading before trimming losses to about 2% by late morning in Hong Kong. Firefighters continued battling the massive blaze on Thursday, nearly 18 hours after it tore through parts of the densely populated Wang Fuk Court estate in Tai Po.The disaster was the city's worst fire in decades, which erupted suddenly on Wednesday afternoon and rapidly engulfed several sections of the 32-storey complex, home to roughly 2,000 units.Authorities have arrested three men, saying flammable materials left behind during maintenance work had allowed the fire “to spread rapidly beyond control.”The buildings had been wrapped in bamboo scaffolding, a traditional but highly flammable material still widely used in Hong Kong.The fire began around 2:50 pm on Wednesday, with the estate under repair and wrapped in bamboo scaffolding, flames spread rapidly through the eight-building complex.The precise cause remains unknown, but officials believe leftover flammable material from maintenance work played a major role in the fire’s fast escalation. Rescue operations and investigations are ongoing.China Taiping underwrote third-party liability and employee compensation for mandatory building and window inspection work at the complex, Bloomberg reported.The HK$316 million (US$41 million) project, which used bamboo scaffolding and protective netting, is now part of an ongoing investigation into the cause of the disaster.The insurer’s policy covers the full contract sum plus an additional HK$50 million (US$6.4 million) for accidents, and provides HK$200 million in employee compensation. Separately, the company holds a general property-all-risk policy worth HK$2 billion.According to Bloomberg, Hong Kong Insurance Professionals Federation chairman Philip Mak said both the general all-risk policy and the construction-specific coverage are “seriously underinsured” given the scale of the multi-tower estate.Mak noted that rebuilding communal areas and replacing elevator steel cables will likely exceed the insured amounts. Individual flat owners may claim death or injury benefits under the HK$50 million accident portion, but he warned the sum is “nowhere near enough” in light of the number of deaths and the hundreds still unaccounted for.",China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co. shares fell sharply on Thursday amid concerns over its exposure to a Hong Kong construction project.

The factors influencing turkey prices this Thanksgiving

Grocery stores in the US are absorbing the rising cost of turkeys this Thanksgiving. A spike in bird flu cases has pushed up wholesale prices, according to new data from the US department of agriculture (USDA). But these higher costs are not being passed on to shoppers.USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year. Experts say stores are taking the hit to keep customers coming in, reported NBC News. Even the projected cost of a full Thanksgiving meal has stayed broadly steady.The main reason for the higher costs is a drop in supply. Bird flu has spread again among commercial poultry farms this autumn. By October, more than 2 million turkeys had been culled after exposure. Minnesota, the largest turkey-producing state, reported six confirmed outbreaks that month.David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University, told NBC, another virus avian metapneumovirus is also affecting production by reducing the number of viable eggs laid by hens. This has slowed farmers’ efforts to rebuild their flocks.Overall, turkey supply is tightening. The USDA expects production to fall to 4.8 million pounds this year, down from 5.1 million pounds in 2024.This shortage has pushed up costs for retailers. USDA data shows the wholesale price of frozen turkeys, the type most families buy for Thanksgiving, has jumped by about 80% since last year, rising from under $1 per pound to more than $1.70.A separate USDA report shows retail prices for frozen turkeys staying flat. Ortega said shops may be absorbing these increases to stop customers from switching stores. Retailers often use turkeys as a “loss leader”, selling them at or below cost to draw in shoppers and make up the difference through other items in their baskets.While turkey prices have stayed stable for shoppers, the overall cost of a Thanksgiving meal varies depending on the data source. Some estimates show prices rising by nearly 10%, while others show a fall of up to 5%.",USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

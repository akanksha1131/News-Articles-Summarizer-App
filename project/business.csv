Flexibility in Tax Regime Selection for Salary TDS

Income Tax Filing FY 2024-25 : Employers are currently requesting salaried employees to provide documentation of tax-saving investments and expenses if they wish to reduce their tax liability. These documents are essential to prevent complete tax deduction at source (TDS) from the salary.Most employees typically have until March to provide tax-saving documentation, however it is beneficial to submit them promptly. Until documentation is provided, employers will deduct the full tax amount from salary without considering any tax-saving investments. Tax specialists indicate that not every employee needs to submit investment documentation.Regarding who must provide investment proof to avoid complete salary taxation, Prakash Hegde, a practising Chartered Accountant, told ET, ""The employees who have opted for the old tax regime are required to submit investment proofs to their employers to claim exemptions and deductions via their employer. The employees who have opted for the new tax regime need not have to submit any proof for exemption and deductions as most of them are not available in the new tax regime.""The Income Tax Act, 1961's old tax regime provides various tax exemptions and deductions that individuals can claim to decrease their gross taxable income. This reduction in taxable income subsequently leads to lower income tax obligations.Also Read | Small savings schemes: What are the latest interest rates for post office schemes like PPF, SSY, SCSS for Jan-March 2025?

Here's a comprehensive list of common deductions and their required documentation:The new income tax regime permits only two deductions for taxpayers, eliminating the need to submit investment documentation. These include a standard deduction of Rs 75,000 from salary/pension earnings and a deduction up to 14% of basic salary for employer's NPS account contributions.According to CBDT's statement dated August 2, 2024, ""72% of taxpayers have opted for the New Tax Regime, while 28% continue to be in the Old Tax Regime.""

'IT hiring may not keep pace with biz growth',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/it-hiring-may-not-keep-pace-with-biz-growth/articleshow/117248389.cms,"BENGALURU: As IT firms saw revenue productivity increase amid lower headcount, HCLTech CEO C Vijayakumar said adding headcount may not necessarily keep pace with revenue growth.He noted that the IT industry's requirement for skilled professionals will continue to rise steadily, leading to higher billing rates. ""I think you should keep in mind that some of the growth came from improving utilisation for many companies. There are also some onshore-offshore mix changes that could have driven growth. The service industry has a long-term correlation with adding people. I don't think that is changing. Maybe the people addition may not be at the same level as revenue growth, but your wage bill increase will continue to rise in line with the revenue because you need higher-skilled and more experienced people. All of that will drive the wage bill higher,"" Vijayakumar told TOI in a post-earnings interaction on Tuesday.TOI reported that the Indian IT sector's overall revenue per head grew approximately 6% year-on-year in the initial six months of FY25. With a single-digit growth outlook, many large IT firms have not added people for the last two years, and this could be the reason for improved revenue productivity.HCLTech has reduced its fresher recruitment target from 10,000 to 7,000 for the year. HCL added 2,134 employees in the Dec quarter, taking the total headcount to 220,755. When asked about rolling out low single-digit hikes, Vijayakumar clarified that the average hike for eligible candidates was around 7%.Even as developers are coming to grips with how GenAI will impact their roles, especially with low to medium complexity code already being automated, Vijayakumar said, ""I think it's about embracing generative AI that is really the big message to the developer community. If you can embrace and see in the new scheme of the workflows and see where incremental value can be added.""He continued, ""AgenticAI is still early days and it would have some impact on the number of tasks and all of that. But we're also seeing more work coming because of generative AI. I mean application modernisation , which was not even attempted in the past, is now being attempted. So, I think that's going to create some new demand.""Vijayakumar said there is a gradual improvement in the number of PoCs getting converted into revenue. According to Vijayakumar, contracts are now being signed for shorter durations, resulting in reduced tenure periods. While this naturally affects the overall contract value, he emphasised that the annual contract value remains strong when compared to the previous year, which serves as a more relevant indicator in the current scenario.","HCLTech has reduced its fresher recruitment target from 10,000 to 7,000 for the year.

Demerger to push pace of growth: ITC Hotels MD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/demerger-to-push-pace-of-growth-itc-hotels-md/articleshow/117248250.cms,"NEW DELHI: The second largest Indian hospitality player — ITC Hotels — is now looking at “accelerated growth” following its hiving off as a separate listed company from the eponymous parent group. On Tuesday as its shares were credited to demat accounts of eligible ITC shareholders, ITC Hotels MD Anil Chadha told TOI the carved out debt-free company will be “more nimble, agile and attract increased investments”.“We are well placed across segments from luxury to premium with our six brands. In the last 24 months we have opened 30 properties and as of now 4,000 keys in 45 properties are in the pipeline that will open at a similar pace. From 13,000 rooms in 140 hotels as of now, we will grow to over 18,000 rooms in 200 hotels by 2030 with our asset right strategy,” Chadha said.The group has come a long way from the first hotel it opened in Chennai 50 years ago, followed by one in Agra and then Delhi’s Maurya. India’s largest and oldest hospitality player — Tata Group’s Taj — had opened its first property in 1903 and currently has a portfolio of 350 hotels including about 120 in the pipeline. According to hospitality consultancy firm Hotelivate, Marriott International has the maximum hotel rooms in India (about 24,000) followed by Taj Group (about 22,000), Radisson (about 14,000); ITC (13,000) and Accor (about 10,000) followed by others.So apart from unlocking value for the group, ITC Hotels’ demerger is also aimed at accelerating the pace of growth as Indian economy is poised to boom in coming years. On the international front, ITC is setting up two more hotels in Nepal after Colombo, Chadha added. It is getting offers to manage more properties in Sri Lanka.The parent tobacco major will transfer Rs 1,500 crore to the demerged entity in which it will now be the 40% stakeholder and retain trademarks of popular restaurants Bukhara, Dum Pukht and Dakshin for which it will get royalty. Incidentally, ITC Ltd holds 16.13% stake in Oberoi Hotels’ parent company EIH and has stake in some other hotel companies too.“About 80% of our pipeline hotels are brownfield (which have a much higher chance of becoming reality that Greenfield projects) that will increase our managed portfolio. The earlier ratio of 45% owned and 55% managed properties will change to 65% managed and 35% owned. The next round of growth will come from upscale and economy segments,” Chadha said.With its famous restaurant brands, food & beverage (F&B) has been an important part of ITC Hotels’ journey. In pre-Covid times, room rentals and F&B generated almost equal revenue with a significant number of walk-ins coming for dining too apart from residents. Now with tariffs increasing sharply since late 2021, the share of tariffs has gone up to 52% with F&B accounting for 40% and other items like banquets & spas the remaining 8%.“India is maturing on all fronts and there is an increase in demand across segments. We are not seeing any slowdown in consumption in our industry. We have great assets, fantastic operational efficiency and are well poised to keep pace with our country’s amazing growth. Infra creation happening in India is creating a new wave of demand that was till now seen in tourist hubs abroad — visitors coming for events/expos during weekdays at newly created mega venue like Bharat Mandapam in Delhi or Jio Centre in Mumbai and then using the weekend for tourism before they head home. ITC Hotels is very excited at the next phase of growth that lies ahead,” Chadha said.","ITC Hotels is now looking at ‘accelerated growth’ following its hiving off as a separate listed company from the eponymous parent group. In the last 24 months we have opened 30 properties and as of now 4,000 keys in 45 properties are in the pipeline that will open at a similar pace.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117248314,imgsize-1312044,width-400,resizemode-4/117248314.jpg"

RBI looks to retain stance on rupee amid volatility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-looks-to-retain-stance-on-rupee-amid-volatility/articleshow/117247729.cms,"MUMBAI/ NEW DELHI: RBI will retain its policy of currency market intervention to check excessive volatility as part of its overall strategy for macro-economic management , amid reports indicating a more ""flexible approach"".On Tuesday, the Indian currency dropped to close at a new low of 86.63 against the dollar, down from the previous close of 86.58, after touching an intraday low of 86.65, on reports by Reuters and Bloomberg that the central bank, under new governor Sanjay Malhotra had signalled greater flexibility. The rupee came under further pressure following the reports.Dealers said there was pressure on the rupee because of the non-deliverable forward (NDF) market. In the NDF market, participants speculate on the future exchange rate of the rupee without trading the currency directly. Instead, they settle their bets in dollars based on the rupee's actual exchange rate at the contract's maturity. To manage their exposure from these bets, banks buy dollars, which creates pressure on the currency markets.Over the years, despite pressure from the US and international agencies, RBI and govt have maintained their stand on dealing with currency volatility.Although recent data suggests that the rupee is over-valued against a basket of other currencies, the policy is also geared to maintain price stability in crucial commodities such as petroleum and edible oil, given the excessive import reliance. A weak currency can add to pressure on inflation at a time when the central bank is focused on ensuring that retail price inflation is anchored close to its target of 4%.Over the last four months, RBI has aggressively intervened in the market and used the foreign exchange reserve to defend the Indian currency against an appreciating dollar. From a peak of over $705 billion in Sept, India's foreign exchange reserves dropped to $635 billion at the end of Dec.The active intervention in the market has also sucked out liquidity as RBI pumped in dollars in exchange for rupees and has faced some criticism for further putting pressure on interest rates.In any case a weaker currency is seen to be good for exports, provided other currencies also move in the same direction. The greenback continued to rule strong with the dollar index staying firm at 109.5. US stocks opened higher after Bloomberg reported that the incoming Donald Trump administration is considering tariff hikes of 2-5% a month, rather than aggressive one-time increases.

China discusses sale of TikTok US to Elon Musk as one possible option,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-discusses-sale-of-tiktok-us-to-elon-musk-as-one-possible-option/articleshow/117219501.cms,"Musk thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. (AI image for representation only.)

Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd, the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on January 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump ’s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.A potential high-profile deal with one of Trump’s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump’s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.Under one scenario that’s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk’s X — the former Twitter — would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X’s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It’s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It’s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. “In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,” he wrote on X. “Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.”ByteDance and TikTok representatives didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China’s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok’s future, also didn’t respond to requests for comment.The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok’s fate may no longer be in ByteDance’s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.The Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company’s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing’s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok’s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.TikTok’s US operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That’s a substantial sum even for the world’s richest person. It’s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc business, the person added.ByteDance’s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok’s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution’s First Amendment.A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban — which takes effect Jan. 19 — so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to “save” the app and there’s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.On a practical level, spinning off TikTok’s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be “extraordinarily difficult.”It’s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O’Leary has said he discussed with Trump. In the past, Microsoft Corp. had sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company.One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app — with different branding — to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It’s not clear how effective such a move would be.One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world’s richest person with businesses that straddle the world’s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company’s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.","Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban.

Employees in the United States will be notified of their status by February 10, with international employees to be informed later, AFP reported.“We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year,” Zuckerberg stated, “but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.” He noted that some employees who underperformed in the last period may be retained if there is optimism about their future contributions.

Zuckerberg also unveiled changes to content moderation policies, easing restrictions on divisive topics such as immigration and gender while loosening rules on hate speech.Last week, Meta also announced reductions to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) team and scaled back related programs. The policy changes have drawn praise from Republican figures and criticism from Democrats, with some accusing Zuckerberg of aligning with conservative ideas ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20.Meanwhile, Zuckerberg speaking on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast last week, revealed that Meta and other leading tech companies are developing AI systems capable of handling complex coding tasks currently performed by human engineers.He announced plans to replace midlevel software engineers with artificial intelligence by 2025, signaling a major shift in how the tech giant approaches software development.Meta’s shares fell Tuesday following the layoff news, reflecting investor concerns over the company's broader direction."," Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is set to lay off approximately 3,600 employees identified as low performers.

Goldman Sachs sees last week's US sanctions on tanker fleet carrying Russian oil pushing up benchmark Brent crude to $85/barrel in the near-term and $90 if any reduction in Russian shipments coincide with a possible decline in Iranian output.A reduction in Russian supplies will prompt India, the second-largest buyer of Russian crude after China, to pivot towards its traditional Middle-East suppliers, Africa and the Americas. This could already be happening, with ship-tracking agencies recently reporting a gradual increase in the share of Middle-East shipments. But that could be partly because of razor-thin discounts on Russian crude amid low oil prices and Moscow curtailing exports as its refineries increase run rate to meet heightened winter demand for products at home.","Global oil price continued their rally to jump past $81 per barrel on Monday - the highest since Aug 2024.

Chinese trade surplus soars to $1 trillion on pre-Trump exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-trade-surplus-soars-to-1-trillion-on-pre-trump-exports/articleshow/117189744.cms,"A truck loaded with vehicles moves to lines of vehicles for export at a port in Yantai in eastern China's Shandong province.

US-China trade war

David Qu, economist

China’s trade surplus soared last year to a record as companies rushed to get goods out the door to make up for sluggish demand at home and ahead of the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House.The surplus was an unprecedented $992 billion in 2024, according to a statement from the customs administration on Monday. That was 21% higher than the previous year and was driven by record exports and weak imports.The value of shipments rose almost every month last year, pushing it above the 2022 highs during the pandemic. Strong demand from overseas has helped provide growth for a domestic economy that has struggled due to a continuing housing crisis and weak consumption, although that support now faces external challenges.Exports rose almost 11% to $336 billion in December, the second-highest month on record and behind only December 2021, when Chinese firms saw a surge of pandemic-led demand. Outbound shipments for the whole of last year were worth $3.6 trillion.Imports rose 1% last month and 1.1% for the whole year.This may be one of the last high points for Chinese trade, at least directly with the US, with Trump promising to impose even higher tariffs on Chinese goods when he takes office next week. Punitive levies may push Chinese firms to divert their exports, flooding other markets with cheap goods and widening trade tensions.“Exporters likely anticipated potential trade war to happen in 2025 and pushed delivery to avoid higher tariff down the road,” said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. “The key issue to watch is the policies from Washington DC in coming weeks, and the policy reactions from Beijing.”Exports to the US rose to the highest in more than two years in December, hitting almost $49 billion and taking the total for the year to $525 billion.Despite shipping record amounts of goods, Chinese exporters have been getting less money for their products, with export prices falling for more than a year as deflation inside China worsens and pushes down the cost of goods. The result is that the growth in the volume of Chinese trade has outpaced value, with total export volumes rising 7.3% through November according to the Ministry of Transport, faster than the 5.4% rise in values.That can be seen in Shanghai port, which last year became the first anywhere in the world to handle the equivalent of more than 50 million 20-foot shipping containers. The port processed 51.5 million boxes last year, almost 5% more than in 2023 and 19% more than in 2019, the year before the pandemic.",China’s trade surplus soared last year to a record as companies rushed to get goods out the door.

Wage gains



The US economy in December added the most jobs since March and the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell, capping a surprisingly strong year and supporting the case for a pause in Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts.Nonfarm payrolls increased 256,000, exceeding all but one forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, while average hourly earnings rose 0.3% from November, a Bureau of Labor Statistics report showed Friday.Treasury yields and the dollar surged and S&P 500 futures sank following the release as traders pushed back expectations for another reduction to later in the year.Friday’s report confirms the labor market held up last year despite high borrowing costs, lingering inflation and political uncertainty. While demand for workers moderated and the unemployment rate rose in 2024, the economy still added 2.2 million jobs — below the 3 million increase in 2023 but above the 2 million created in 2019.The Fed’s focus has returned firmly to inflation following an upturn in recent months, with several officials signaling they may hold rates steady for a while after lowering borrowing costs by a full percentage point in 2024. The BLS will publish monthly data on consumer prices on Jan. 15.December’s advance in payrolls was led by health care and social assistance, retail trade and leisure and hospitality. Government payrolls also advanced. Manufacturing and wholesale trade posted declines.The participation rate — the share of the population that is working or looking for work — was unchanged at 62.5%. The rate for workers of ages 25-54, also known as prime-age workers, was also unchanged.The figures also showed fewer people permanently lost their jobs and more workers left positions voluntarily, while the median duration of unemployment ticked lower.Central bankers are paying close attention to how labor supply and demand dynamics are impacting wage gains. Friday’s report showed average hourly earnings increased 3.9% from a year ago. Earnings for nonsupervisory employees, who make up the majority of workers, advanced 0.2% from November and 3.8% from a year earlier, marking the slowest annual pace since mid-2021.The jobs report is comprised of two surveys — one of businesses and the other of households. The data incorporated annual revisions to the household survey, which is used to produce statistics like the unemployment and participation rates. Those revisions didn’t change the overall picture of the labor market. Benchmark revisions to the business survey are due next month.Though data on weekly filings for unemployment insurance suggest layoffs remained subdued in 2024, several big-name companies including BlackRock Inc. and Tyson Foods Inc. have revealed plans to reduce headcount this year. In 2024, companies announced the fewest hires in almost a decade, according to a report from executive-coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.It also remains to be seen how President-elect Donald Trump’s economic agenda — particularly plans for mass deportations and punitive tariffs on imported goods — will impact the labor market.","Nonfarm payrolls increased 256,000, exceeding all but one forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

"US economy likely added 153,000 jobs last month, returning to normal after strike and hurricanes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-likely-added-153000-jobs-last-month-returning-to-normal-after-strike-and-hurricanes/articleshow/117114666.cms,"WASHINGTON: Getting a clear view of the US job market hasn't been easy the past few months.Hurricanes and a big strike at Boeing threw off the October jobs numbers, pushing them down and setting up a payback rebound in November that likely exaggerated the strength of hiring.The December jobs numbers, out Friday from the Labor Department, are expected to deliver a more accurate reading of where things stand. Most economists expect them to show that hiring is solid but slowing, especially compared to the boom days of 2021-2023. Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet expect that U.S. payrolls grew by 153,000 last month, compared to 227,000 in November and a mere 36,000 in strike- and hurricane-hit OctoberBoston College economist Brian Bethune is slightly more optimistic about last month's hiring. He's expecting 165,000 to 175,000 new jobs in December - a number, he says, that would be seen by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as striking a Goldilocks balance, not hot enough to inflame worries about inflation, not cold enough to suggest the economy is sputtering. ""If we got a number in that range, he'd put his feet up on the desk and probably have a good bourbon,'' Bethune said.If the forecasters are right about December hiring, the American economy generated about 2.1 million jobs last year, not bad but down from 3 million in 2023, 4.5 million in 2022 and a record 7.2 million in 2021 as the economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns and massive layoffs in 2020. The unemployment rate is forecast to have remained at a low 4.2% in December.Over the past few years, the economy and the job market have shown surprising resilience. Responding to inflation that hit a four-decade high two and a half years ago, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate - the fed funds rate -- 11 times in 2022 and 2023, taking it to the highest level in more than two decades.The higher borrowing costs were widely expected to cause a recession but didn't. Companies kept hiring, consumers kept spending, and the economy kept rolling along. In fact, U.S. gross domestic product - the nation's output of goods and services -- has expanded at a robust annual pace of 3% or more in four of the last five quarters.American workers enjoy unusual job security. Layoffs are running below the pre-pandemic trend. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that just 211,000 people applied for unemployment benefits last week, the fewest in nearly a year.Inflation has come down, too, from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.7% in November. The drop in year-over-year price increases gave the Fed enough confidence to cut rates three times in the last four months of 2024.But Fed officials signaled at their December meeting that they planned to be more cautious about rate cuts this year. They now project just two rate reductions in 2025, down from the four they envisioned back in September. Progress against inflation has stalled in recent months, and it remains stuck above the Fed's 2% target.Friday's job report is expected to show that average hourly wages rose 0.3% last month from November and 4% from December 2023, according to the FactSet survey. The Fed sometimes frets that wage gains will fuel inflation as companies try to pass along higher labor costs to customers by raising prices.But Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a commentary that current wage growth is consistent with the Fed's inflation goals. That is partly because strong gains in U.S. productivity allow companies to pay their workers more and earn fatter profits without having to raise prices. ""Earnings growth won't give the Fed any headaches,"" Vanden Houten wrote.","The December jobs numbers are expected to deliver a more accurate reading of where things stand.

However, the data suggests these initiatives have yet to significantly impact the world's second-largest economy.The whole of 2024 saw flat prices, reflecting the previous year's performance.

McDonald's rolls back diversity practices; which other US firms have done the same?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/mcdonalds-rolls-back-diversity-practices-which-other-us-firms-have-done-the-same/articleshow/117032353.cms,"What is the DEI initiative?

Other companies scaling back DEI initiatives

Walmart

Ford

Lowe’s

John Deere

Tractor Supply

McDonald’s has announced crucial changes to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, joining a growing list of companies pulling back on such initiatives. The fast-food giant cited the US Supreme Court’s July 2023 ruling, which also banned affirmative action in college admissions, as a key factor influencing its decision.The Chicago-based burger chain will discontinue specific diversity goals for senior leadership and retire its program encouraging suppliers to adopt DEI training.Additionally, the fast food entity’s diversity team will be rebranded as the Global Inclusion Team, a shift the company says better reflects its values and business focus. Despite these changes,McDonald’s emphasised its commitment to fostering inclusion, calling a diverse workforce a “competitive advantage.”Back in 2021, McDonald's introduced a range of diversity initiatives following multiple sexual harassment lawsuits from employees and a discrimination lawsuit filed by a group of Black former franchise owners.At the time, McDonald's chairman and CEO Chris Kempczinski wrote in a LinkedIn post, ""As a world-leading brand that considers inclusion one of our core values, we will accept nothing less than real, measurable progress in our efforts to lead with empathy, treat people with dignity and respect, and seek out diverse points of view to drive better decision-making.""However, the company said that the ""shifting legal landscape"" following the Supreme Court decision and the actions of other corporations caused it to reconsider its own policies.This decision reflects a broader trend as conservative activists challenge DEI programs in corporate America, targeting workplace initiatives aimed at supporting historically marginalised groups. Critics argue such policies are unfair and advocate for equal opportunities without consideration of race, gender, or sexual orientation.The DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiative refers to a set of policies and programs aimed at promoting a more inclusive and equitable environment within organisations. These initiatives often include measures to promote diversity in leadership roles, support historically marginalised groups, and ensure fair treatment regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation.Conservative activists have been targeting companies through legal action and social media campaigns, aiming to challenge workplace initiatives. Their focus includes diversity programs and hiring practices designed to support historically marginalised groups, as well as broader objections to initiatives centred on gender identity and sexual orientation.The world’s largest retailer had announced earlier in November that it would not renew its five-year commitment to an equity racial centre established after George Floyd’s death in 2020. It also exited the Human Rights Campaign’s LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion index and revised its supplier diversity policies, ceasing to prioritise demographic factors such as race and gender.Furthermore, Walmart pledged to monitor its third party marketplace more closely to prevent the sale of products aimed at LGBTQ+ minors, such as chest binders for transgender youth.In August, Ford’s CEO Jim Farley outlined changes to the company’s DEI policies, including withdrawing from the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. Farley stated that thr company does not use hiring quotas or link compensation to diversity metrics but remains committed to fostering an inclusive workplace.“We will continue to put our effort and resources into taking care of our customers, our team, and our communities versus publicly commenting on the many polarizing issues of the day,” the memo stated.Lowe’s also reevaluated its DEI programs, consolidating employee resource groups into one organisation and stepping back from LGBTQ+ inclusion events like parades and festivals. The retailer said these adjustments were made following the Supreme Court’s affirmative action decision.Previously, the company had “individual groups representing diverse sections of our associate population.”It will cease to participate in festivals and parades that are outside of its business domain.In July, the farm equipment manufacturer announced it would no longer sponsor cultural awareness events or implement diversity quotas. John Deere also committed to auditing its training materials to ensure compliance with federal laws and to remove “socially motivated messages.”Moline, Illinois based company further added “the existence of diversity quotas and pronoun identification have never been and are not company policy.” However, it would still work to “track and advance” the diversity of the company.The rural retailer eliminated all DEI roles and goals in June after facing conservative backlash online. It also announced it would cease sponsoring Pride festivals and voting campaigns and no longer be submitting data for the HRC index.The National Black Farmers Association also called on Tractor Supply’s president and CEO to step down shortly after the company's announcement.","McDonald's has announced changes to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

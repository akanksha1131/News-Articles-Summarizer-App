Belgian Court Clears Fugitive Jeweller Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India

NEW DELHI: Belgium’s Supreme Court has turned down Mehul Choksi’s appeal against his extradition to India. Court officials said that the order from the Antwerp Court of Appeal, which had cleared the way for his extradition, will now stand.Spokesperson for Court of Cassation, Advocaat-generaal Henri Vanderlinden, told PTI, ""The Court of Cassation rejected the appeal. So, the decision of the Court of Appeal stands. The process of his extradition will begin now,"" officials said.Choksi had gone to the Court of Cassation on 30 October, hoping to overturn the appellate court’s decision issued on 17 October. After reviewing the matter, it dismissed his challenge. This also ends the temporary pause on the extradition order.Earlier, the Antwerp Court of Appeal had agreed to India’s request to extradite Choksi in the Punjab National Bank fraud case. It said the charges against him, including criminal conspiracy, cheating, embezzlement and forgery, are crimes under both Indian and Belgian law.The court also said there was no evidence to support Choksi’s claims that the case was politically motivated or that he had been forcibly taken from Antigua.Indian officials had submitted details about his medical care and conditions in custody.

After completing its initial targets at 26250, Nifty has been facing profit taking near to its previous all-time high levels followed by a 9 week rising trendline support break at 25950 earlier this week. Negation for this is seen only on closing above the 26000 mark - until then Nifty can continue to underperform Banking as well as broader markets with a potential to slide 1.5% - 2% from CMP.The breakout on Bank Nifty v/s Nifty ratio chart continues to hold on to, while re-iterating Bank Nifty’s outperformance going forward in the current series as well. Any break of 58900 is likely to allow a similar 1.5% - 2% cooloff on the index given the pressure from broader markets now seen creeping into the frontline names.A triangle breakdown from a 18 month formation has been seen with far deeper targets, however given the market structure it is wiser to play this crack for a 5-7% drop until it hits its initial 200 DMA support line on weekly charts.Bullish flag breakout is seen on charts of CHOLAFIN in a market wherein broader names are bleeding while NBFC names are enjoying a tailwind.Stock is also on verge of giving its highest ever weekly closing at CMP this week.

IndiGo's operational meltdown





Shocks spill to the wider market





As India's aviation industry is grappling with ongoing IndiGo crisis, SpiceJet has launched a major winter push to fulfil the continued demand. In a statement released on Wednesday, the carrier outlined plans to add up to 100 daily flights during the ongoing winter schedule, noting that the expansion is still subject to regulatory approval. The airline, as cited by ET, said that the move reflects “strong and growing demand across key routes.”The carrier has been steadily building capacity ahead of the announcement. Seventeen aircraft have returned to operations over the past two months through a mix of damp leases and the revival of its own grounded planes, with more inductions expected. According to the airline, the additions provide “operational flexibility to deploy incremental capacity on high-demand routes and improve overall network resilience. ” It further told ET added that its strategy is centred on “maximising aircraft utilisation, strengthening connectivity and better aligning capacity with demand.”The expansion marks a year-end acceleration for SpiceJet, combining a larger fleet with increased frequencies at a time when IndiGo’s troubles have created a rare opening in the domestic market.The market response has been swift. SpiceJet’s stock rose as much as 5% on December 10, reaching an intraday high of Rs 36.The jump extends a four-day rally that has lifted the share price by 19% in just a few sessions. As of 12:55 the stock was trading at Rs 34, up 1.5%, on the BSE.The surge comes as IndiGo faces the possibility of penalties for its handling of the turmoil that unfolded over the past several days. The airline cancelled more than 5,000 flights due to a shortage of pilots, prompting the government to order a 10% reduction in its approved winter schedule. The cut translates to roughly 110 flights a day being reassigned to other carriers.IndiGo’s operational collapse has been striking for an airline that typically commands about two-thirds of India’s domestic traffic. The carrier’s on-time performance plunged to 8.5%, leading to large-scale cancellations across major hubs including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. The DGCA noted that IndiGo could not support the ~15,014 weekly departures allocated to it for the winter schedule and has directed a reduction, ET reported.The disruptions left thousands of passengers facing last-minute changes and urgent searches for alternative flights. SpiceJet’s latest expansion aligns with this moment, as gaps left by IndiGo create immediate room for other domestic players to add capacity.Travellers may see short-term relief as SpiceJet introduces more flights, which could ease pressure on busy routes affected by IndiGo’s cancellations. Better connectivity and additional choices are expected as the new flights roll out.For the aviation sector, IndiGo’s setbacks and SpiceJet’s rapid scale-up signal a potential rebalancing of market share during the winter travel period. With the regulator already stepping in to curb IndiGo’s schedule, the industry may face closer oversight of capacity management and service reliability going forward.","SpiceJet plans to add up to 100 daily flights during the ongoing winter schedule.

Trump's $1m ‘Gold Card’ visa unveiled: What applicants stand to gain; what remains off-limits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-1m-gold-card-visa-unveiled-what-applicants-stand-to-gain-what-remains-off-limits/articleshow/125900784.cms,"Donald Trump’s ‘Gold Card’ Promises New Path For Indians, US Allows Companies To Hire Top Graduates

What 'Gold Card' gets you?



Fastrack legal residency and US citizenship



Access for top tier graduates and skilled labour



$15,000 vetting fee



What it doesn’t get you



No job obligations, no mention of caps



No guarantee of lower costs for businesses



Not a departure from merit-based immigration politics



US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled his long-anticipated “gold card,” a high-priced immigration offering designed to grant legal status, and eventually US citizenship, to individuals and companies willing to pay significant sums.Framed as a replacement for the three-decade-old EB-5 investor visa, the new programme opens the door to permanent residency for foreign nationals ready to invest $1 million personally or $2 million through their employers. Trump has cast the gold card as a way to attract the world’s “best people,” pitching it not only as a magnet for elite graduates from US universities but also as a revenue generator for the federal government.The rollout comes against the backdrop of Trump’s strict immigration crackdowns. Even as his government has pursued mass deportations and tightened border controls, Trump has repeatedly argued that exceptional foreign-born talent should be allowed to stay.""THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT’S TRUMP GOLD CARD IS HERE TODAY! A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Despite its branding, the “gold card” is essentially a revamped green card, but one that Trump touts as “much better” and offering a “stronger path.”Holders receive permanent legal residency, meaning they can live and work in the United States indefinitely and, over time, pursue US citizenship.Unlike the EB-5 programme, which hinges on job-creation requirements, the new card’s criteria appear streamlined: payment of the required fee and completion of background vetting.Green Cards are accessible via multiple routes including sponsorship, lotteries, or EB-5 investments starting at $800,000 with job creation requirements. Gold Cards require a $5 million direct payment (or sometimes cited as $1 million for a base version), bypassing traditional processes for faster approval aimed at economic benefit.Under the Gold Card program, a successful applicant would receive lawful permanent resident status under the EB-1 or EB-2 visa categories, as determined by the US department of homeland security and subject to availability.One of Trump’s central arguments for the programme is its ability to retain highly skilled graduates from US universities, particularly those from China, India, and France.Businesses, he has said, routinely lose world-class candidates because their visa status is uncertain. The gold card aims to remove that barrier, offering companies the opportunity to secure permanent residency for prized recruits, with each card tied to a single individual.""Tremendous people won't have to say they graduated from college and have to go back to India, China, France; we're taking care of that,"" Trump said as he launched the card.""You can't hire people from the best colleges because you don't know whether or not you can keep the person,"" the US president said.Every application includes a $15,000 vetting fee to fund thorough background checks, according to commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.The administration has framed this level of scrutiny as ensuring only top-qualifying individuals obtain residency.Meanwhile, Trump emphasized the programme’s fiscal upside, promising all proceeds will go directly to the US government to fund “positive” national initiatives.Unlike the EB-5 system it replaces, the gold card comes with no stated requirements for job creation by investors or employers.Trump’s announcement also omitted any reference to annual caps or limitations on the number of cards available.This leaves questions about oversight, scalability, and how the programme fits into broader immigration policy frameworks.While corporations can purchase multiple cards, each one applies to only one employee, meaning costs scale directly with the number of hires.Companies seeking to retain multiple foreign-born graduates could find themselves paying millions, a model that favors well-capitalized employers and wealthy individuals but may not help smaller firms struggling with talent shortages.Despite Trump’s hardline stance on immigration elsewhere, the gold card neither resolves nor escapes the political tensions within his base.Critics within the MAGA movement have objected to policies that increase legal immigration, even in selective forms.Although framed as “bringing in the best people,” the programme does not address broader concerns around fairness, accessibility, or the treatment of immigrants without wealth or elite credentials.","US President Donald Trump unveiled his long-anticipated 'gold card' on Wednesday. The programme is designed to grant legal status, and eventually US citizenship, to individuals and companies willing to pay significant sums. Trump has cast the gold card as a way to attract the world’s “best people,” pitching it as a magnet for elite graduates from US universities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125901082,imgsize-1242926,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

‘Soulless and demonic’: McDonald’s takes down AI-generated Christmas ad after massive backlash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/soulless-and-demonic-mcdonalds-takes-down-ai-generated-christmas-ad-after-massive-backlash/articleshow/125897233.cms,"Viewers slam McDonald’s ad as creepy and anti Christmas

McDonald’s response: Comments disabled, video taken private

Part of a growing trend of AI ad controversies

McDonald’s Netherlands has pulled its fully AI-generated Christmas advert after it triggered an online storm of outrage, confusion and mockery. The ad, titled It’s the Most Terrible Time of the Year, showed a series of chaotic holiday mishaps and suggested viewers should “hide out in McDonald’s until January. ” Far from charming audiences, the video went viral for all the wrong reasons, with many calling it cold, creepy and emotionally empty.Social media quickly erupted with criticism. Thousands of users described the ad as soulless, depressing and even demonic. Commenters said it felt wrong for a brand associated with family outings to release a holiday message that mocked the very idea of family gatherings. Many accused McDonald’s of relying on AI at the cost of human creativity, calling the visuals unsettling and the tone disturbingly bleak for a Christmas campaign.Others pointed out strange AI generated details in the chaotic scenes, including distorted backgrounds, unnatural lighting and oddly moving objects. Instead of a warm festive message, viewers said the ad delivered a sense of dread.As mockery flooded social platforms, McDonald’s Netherlands disabled YouTube comments and later set the video to private. By then, clips had already spread across X, TikTok and Reddit, fuelling even more debate about whether major brands understand how to use AI responsibly or creatively.In a brief statement, McDonald’s said the experience was a “learning” moment about the effectiveness of AI in advertising, suggesting the company may rethink how it uses the technology in future campaigns.The ad was produced by The Sweetshop, which claimed the project took seven weeks and involved intense human effort. A representative even said the team’s “fingers hurt from typing prompts,” insisting the AI workflow was simply an expanded creative toolbox.Instead of softening criticism, the explanation became another joke online. Many argued that seven weeks could have produced a far better ad if humans had handled the creative direction instead of relying heavily on AI.McDonald’s is not the first brand to face backlash for experimenting with AI driven marketing. Coca Cola and Toys""R""Us recently came under fire for AI generated ads that viewers found uncanny, emotionless or creatively hollow. With McDonald’s now joining the list, the debate over AI in advertising is intensifying.The controversy has highlighted the gap between what companies hope AI can achieve and how audiences actually respond. While AI promises speed and novelty, viewers still expect emotional warmth, storytelling and authenticity, especially during the holiday season.For McDonald’s, the takeaway is clear. AI may have a place in advertising, but without the human touch that defines festive campaigns, even global brands can quickly find themselves at the centre of a holiday nightmare rather than a holiday hit.","McDonald’s Netherlands has pulled its fully AI-generated Christmas advert after it triggered an online storm of outrage, confusion and mockery.

US Fed meet: Jerome Powell-led FOMC cuts rate by 25 basis points; lowest level in almost three years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-federal-reserve-meeting-today-december-10-2025-fomc-interest-rate-decision-highlights-jerome-powell-president-donald-trump/articleshow/125895246.cms,"US Fed chair Jerome Powell (File photo by AP)

The US Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), led by Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday cut the key rate by 25 basis points. The rate now stands between 3.5 percent and 3.75 percent, the lowest level in nearly three years. ""In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent,"" said the Fed release.""Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up through September. More recent indicators are consistent with these developments. Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated,"" it said.This reduction would support the world’s largest economy as employment conditions deteriorate, though officials remain concerned about ongoing inflation as US President Donald Trump 's tariffs impact supply chains.The Federal Reserve was widely expected to implement its third successive interest rate reduction this week, despite anticipated disagreements among policy officials during their two-day conference.Markets largely expected another quarter-point cut following the Federal Reserve's Tuesday-Wednesday meeting.""It's difficult to recall a time when the Federal Open Market Committee has been so evenly divided about the need for additional rate cuts,"" said economist Michael Pearce of Oxford Economics, referring to the Fed's rate-setting committee according to an AFP report.This division emerges as high inflation suggests prudence in rate reductions, whilst employment market risks provide justification for lower rates, he noted in a recent analysis. The recent government closure has created additional challenges, as it has resulted in a lack of official employment statistics for October and November.The Federal Reserve's decision-making committee comprises 12 individuals with voting rights. This includes seven governors, the president of New York's Federal Reserve, and rotating presidents from other reserve banks, who collectively determine interest rate policies through majority voting.The Federal Reserve maintains dual objectives: achieving maximum employment whilst ensuring price stability. These aims occasionally conflict with each other. When interest rates are reduced, economic activity tends to increase, whereas elevated rates generally restrict economic growth and help control inflation.Recent statistical data indicated a deceleration in employment figures. The governmental closure spanning October through mid-November caused delays in releasing more current federal statistics.","US Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), led by Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday cut the key rate by 25 basis points.

China’s $1 trillion trade surplus: IMF urges shift to domestic growth; warns economy ‘too big’ to rely on exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-1-trillion-trade-surplus-imf-urges-shift-to-domestic-growth-warns-economy-too-big-to-rely-on-exports/articleshow/125894462.cms,".

The head of the International Monetary Fund is urging China to confront its economic imbalances, cautioning that an economy of its size can no longer rely on exports as its main growth engine.Although China’s shipments to the US have weakened amid steep tariffs introduced under President Donald Trump, its overall exports to global markets have continued to expand. Earlier this week, Beijing said its 2025 trade surplus had already climbed past a record $1 trillion.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned that China’s dependence on overseas demand could trigger stronger pushback from its trading partners.“(China's) continuing to depend on export-led growth risks furthering global trade tensions,” she said on Wednesday, as quoted by AP. “China is now too big to rely on exports as a source for growth... and (it has) a large domestic market that can be a big aspiration for growth in the years to come.”Chinese leaders have also highlighted the need to lift consumer spending at home. At a key policy meeting in October, officials again called for reducing the economy’s reliance on exports and large-scale infrastructure building.Progress toward that shift has been disrupted. The pandemic and a long real estate slump have weighed heavily on growth, while Beijing continues to promote high-tech manufacturing and struggles with excess production in some industries, including automobiles.Forecasts from Morgan Stanley, as cited by AP, suggest China’s share of global exports could rise to 16.5% by 2030, up from roughly 15% now, driven by industries such as electric vehicles, robotics and battery technology.Georgieva’s comments came as the IMF wrapped up its annual review of China. Weak spending and soft household demand have pressured the yuan, making Chinese products cheaper abroad and widening trade gaps. The IMF said broader policy steps are needed to encourage consumers to spend more.Even with growth near 5%, Chinese households remain cautious after years of job losses and income setbacks linked to the pandemic. The ongoing property downturn has further eroded household wealth, reducing appetite for both spending and imports.China has boosted exports to regions including Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe, helping offset weaker shipments to the US. But trading partners have raised concerns as China’s import growth has not kept pace. On Wednesday, the EU Chamber of Commerce in China said the country’s large trade surplus is becoming increasingly troubling.Her remarks followed comments from Premier Li Qiang, who told international financial experts on Tuesday that higher tariffs have “dealt a severe blow” to the global economy.","IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned that China’s dependence on overseas demand could trigger stronger pushback from its trading partners. “China is now too big to rely on exports as a source for growth... and (it has) a large domestic market,” she said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125894507,imgsize-341434,width-400,resizemode-4/vhp-flags-pressure-on-judiciary-seeks-debate-on-minority-status-at-delhi-meet-4.jpg"

Nvidia has developed a location verification feature for its chips, aiming to help prevent its advanced artificial intelligence processors from being smuggled into countries where exports are restricted, reported Reuters, citing people familiar with the matterThe move comes amid growing pressure in the United States to tighten oversight of high-end AI hardware. Lawmakers and the White House have been looking for ways to halt the flow of restricted chips to China and other banned destinations, a push that intensified after the Department of Justice brought cases against groups accused of trying to move more than $160 million worth of Nvidia processors into China.The debate over tracking technology has also drawn attention in Beijing. China’s top cybersecurity regulator has questioned Nvidia about whether its products contain backdoors that could enable the US to circumvent security protections. Nvidia has strongly rejected those claims. Software specialists have also noted that location verification can be added without weakening the security of the company’s chips.Those concerns re-emerged this week after US President Donald Trump said he would allow exports of Nvidia’s H200 processors—the immediate predecessor to its Blackwell line—to China. Some foreign policy experts expressed doubts about whether China would allow local buyers to acquire the chips.Nvidia’s location feature, which has been shown privately but is not yet publicly released, would come as an optional software update. Sources said it uses the confidential computing capabilities built into Nvidia’s GPUs. The tool was originally created to help data center operators monitor chip performance, a routine task, and would estimate a chip’s location by measuring communication delays between the device and Nvidia-run servers.""We're in the process of implementing a new software service that empowers data center operators to monitor the health and inventory of their entire AI GPU fleet,"" Nvidia said in a statement. ""This customer-installed software agent leverages GPU telemetry to monitor fleet health, integrity and inventory.""The feature will debut on Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips, which have stronger attestation capabilities than earlier Hopper and Ampere generations.

America's affordability woes: Trump claims prices came down 'tremendously'; hits back at Democrat's 'con job',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/americas-affordability-woes-trump-claims-prices-came-down-tremendously-hits-back-at-democrats-con-job/articleshow/125880351.cms,"Low confidence in Trump



‘Doesn’t Mean Anything!’: Trump DESTROYS ‘Affordability’ Buzzword, Claims Economy Is ‘Great’

'A plus plus plus' economy ?



US President Donald Trump addressed America's affordability concerns at a campaign rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday, saying that the prices have come down ""tremendously. "" He moved to reassure Americans frustrated by high living costs and dismissed Democrat's criticism over inflation as a “hoax”. The event was a shift from his usual arguments about affordability, away from White House briefings and social media posts, into a more energetic campaign setting.Trump asserted that consumer prices are falling sharply. “Prices are coming down tremendously from the highest prices in the history of our country.” His remarks followed earlier claims made at the White House a day earlier, when he insisted, “We’re bringing prices way down,” and argued that Democrats had created the affordability crisis while he was “fixing it”.The push comes at a difficult moment for Trump. Surveys in recent weeks show a drop in public confidence in his handling of the economy, even as the White House says it expects inflation to ease next year.And although he has promised to bring prices down quickly, only 33% of American adults approve of his economic management, according to a November survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Following lacklustre Republican performances in last month’s off-cycle elections, administration officials have been trying to convince voters that the current cost pressures are unrelated to Trump’s policies.But price levels have remained stubborn, rising again after Trump introduced his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Businesses had warned that the sweeping import taxes could lead to higher consumer prices and reduced hiring, even as inflation had begun calming after hitting a 40-year peak in 2022. Trump has instead repeatedly blamed his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for the problem.His appearance in Monroe County, a region that backed Biden in 2020 but swung to Trump in 2024, was closely watched for signs of how voters view his claims. The county, anchored by the tourism-driven Pocono Mountains and increasingly attractive to people priced out of New York City, is set to play a key role in next year’s fight for control of the US House.The rally was held indoors, a change from the larger venues Trump used last year. It also placed him squarely inside the district represented by Republican Rob Bresnahan, who won his 2024 House race by only about 1.5 percentage points and is now a key Democratic target. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti is among those vying to challenge him.Trump has continued to boast about economic performance even as many Americans struggle with rising costs. On a Politico podcast, he rated the economy “A-plus”, later amplifying that to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus”. He has pointed to relaxed auto fuel efficiency standards and agreements aimed at lowering list prices for prescription drugs as evidence that he is easing pressures on consumers. He has also argued that significant cuts to the Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate would lower mortgage and auto-loan costs, despite concerns from critics that such moves could worsen inflation.National indicators show a mixed picture: the stock market has climbed this year, and economic growth appeared solid in the third quarter. Yet many households say the cost of housing, groceries, electricity, education and other essentials continues to erode their incomes. The administration maintains that inflation will subside next year, partly due to investment in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.Trump has repeatedly argued that concerns about affordability are being exaggerated for political effect. Speaking in the Oval Office earlier, he said “affordability is the greatest con job” by Democrats, insisting that his own past actions show he is the one genuinely addressing the issue.","Donald Trump addressed America's affordability concerns at a campaign rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.

Fed call ahead: Central bank eyes third rate cut amid sharp divisions; why follow-up easing looks uncertain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fed-call-ahead-central-bank-eyes-third-rate-cut-amid-sharp-divisions-why-follow-up-easing-looks-uncertain/articleshow/125875291.cms,"'Get Him The Hell Out': Trump Escalates Attack On Fed Chair Jerome Powell; Threatens Bessent

The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower borrowing costs this week, but deep divisions within the policy-making panel suggest further rate cuts will be harder to secure, analysts say.Policymakers are set to meet on December 9–10 amid a complicated economic backdrop, with inflation still running above the Fed’s 2% target even as hiring weakens and unemployment rises. Economists expect Chair Jerome Powell to back a quarter-point cut — the third this year — though dissent is likely to be unusually high, AP reported.Some analysts believe as many as three officials could vote against the cut, marking the most dissenting votes in six years. Only 12 of the Fed’s 19 rate-setting committee members vote on decisions, and several non-voting officials have also expressed opposition to further easing.“It’s just a really tricky time. Perfectly sensible people can reach different answers,” William English, economist at Yale School of Management and former senior Fed staffer, said, highlighting the challenge of building consensus.The debate has been complicated by sparse official data following the prolonged US government shutdown, which delayed employment and inflation readings.Inflation pressures would normally argue against rate cuts, while signs of labour market weakness point in the opposite direction.Most economists now expect a “hawkish cut” — a rate reduction accompanied by guidance suggesting the Fed may pause to assess economic conditions. Financial markets are increasingly focused on the tone of Powell’s commentary rather than the cut itself.Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid is expected to dissent again in favour of holding rates steady, potentially joined by St. Louis Fed president Alberto Musalem. Fed governor Stephen Miran may oppose the quarter-point move and instead argue for a larger half-point reduction.Expectations of a December cut firmed after New York Fed president John Williams said the recent rise in inflation appeared to be a temporary effect linked to tariffs, and that he still saw “room for a further adjustment” in rates. Market-implied odds of a cut now stand at about 89%, according to CME Fedwatch.Powell’s leadership is also being tested politically, as President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised the Fed chair and signalled that a new chair will be appointed when Powell’s term ends in May.While concerns about unemployment — which rose to 4.4% in September — are driving support for a December cut, economists caution that additional easing will depend on upcoming data. The Fed will review a backlog of jobs and inflation reports before its next meeting in January, which could either justify further cuts or compel a pause.","The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower borrowing costs this week.

Job openings have been steadily declining since peaking at a record 12.1 million in March 2022, as higher interest rates dampened hiring momentum, AP reported.The data also showed that layoffs rose to nearly 1.9 million, the highest level since January 2023, while the number of people quitting their jobs — often seen as a measure of worker confidence — fell. This trend suggests that employers seeking to control labour costs may increasingly rely on layoffs rather than natural attrition, Pantheon Macroeconomics’ chief US economist Samuel Tombs said.The JOLTS release was delayed and combined with revised September data due to a 43-day federal government shutdown, which disrupted economic reporting. The shutdown also forced the Labour Department to skip publishing a standalone unemployment rate for October.The figures come as policymakers at the US Federal Reserve meet this week to decide on interest rates. Inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, partly due to tariff-related price pressures, but recent softness in the job market has strengthened expectations that the Fed will cut rates for the third time this year, though dissent among policymakers is possible.The Labour Department is scheduled to release hiring and unemployment data for November next week, later than originally planned. Forecasters surveyed by FactSet expect employers to have added fewer than 38,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate edging up to 4.5%, which would still be low by historical standards but the highest in nearly four years, according to AP.","Employers posted 7.67 million vacancies in October, almost unchanged from 7.66 million in September.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

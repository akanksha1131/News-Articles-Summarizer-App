At 9:21 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,161.50, down 34 points or 0.14%.

A breakout above the upper band of the range, well beyond Nifty 25500, needs positive triggers. Such a trigger may come from an India-US trade deal with tariffs on India pegged at around 20 percent. If this happens, can it trigger a sustained rally in the market? Unlikely. A sustained rally in the market needs earnings support. There are no signs of a strong earnings support and earnings growth visibility. Two big segments of the market - IT services and consumption, particularly FMCG - are struggling with tepid earnings.”“There are green shoots of earnings recovery in FMCG but IT services continue to struggle. This means earnings growth for FY26 will be around 10 percent only. This is the biggest challenge being faced by the market now. Therefore, investors can be stock- specific, focusing on stocks where growth prospects and earnings visibility are bright.""Asian equities declined at Wednesday's opening following mixed US inflation data, causing investors to reduce expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts.The Nasdaq Composite reached a new record close on Tuesday, bolstered by rising Nvidia shares.

"Gold & silver price prediction today: Where are gold, silver rates headed on July 15, 2025 and in the near-term? Here's what investors should know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-price-prediction-today-where-are-gold-silver-rates-headed-on-july-15-2025-and-in-the-near-term-mcx-gold-donald-trump-tariff-deadline/articleshow/122482071.cms,"Gold price prediction: In the very short-term, spot gold is expected to move majorly on tariff news flow. (AI image)

Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan shares his views on gold and silver price outlook:

Gold Performance:

Gold – In the week ending July 11, the yellow metal extended its winning weekly streak to the second straight week on safe haven demand as the US President Trump amped up the trade wars by ratcheting up tariff rates on key economies like Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Canada.

The yellow metal closed with a weekly gain of 0.53% at $3,355.59.

On July 14, spot gold traded between $3,341 and $3,375 as the metal swung with the ebb and flow of tariff news.

Gold retreated as the US President said that he is open to trade negotiations.

At the time of writing this article, spot gold was changing hands at $3,349, down 0.20% for the day, whereas the MCX August gold contract at Rs 97,718 was down 0.10%.

Silver – Silver surged 3.87% in the week ending July 11 on strong ETF inflows and a tight market.

On July 14, spot silver spiked to $39.13, a fresh 14-year high, before backing off along with gold.

At the time of writing this article, the metal was trading at $38.42, up 0.1% for the day. The MCX September Silver contract at Rs 113,060 was up 0.05% for the day.

Tariff developments:

In the weekend, the President imposed 30% tariffs on both the European Union (EU) and Mexico, effective August 1.

Trump warned the EU that he would increase tariff rates should the Bloc retaliate against his measures.

He called Mexico’s curbs to secure US borders insufficient.

For now, the EU has suspended retaliatory measures against the US until August 1 as the Bloc strives to achieve a solution through diplomatic efforts, though it has one active list targeting €21 billion in US exports and a second one targeting €72 billion more if needed

Trump said that South Korea and the EU are in talk with the US on trades.

Trump threatened Russia with 100% tariffs if Putin doesn’t end the Ukraine war within 50 days. Crude oil tumbled on this development.

The President saying that he is open to trade talks weighed on the precious metals complex.

US Dollar Index and yields:

Despite lower oil prices, 10-year US yields at 4.43% were up 0.54% for the day. The yields were up around 1.40% last week.

2-Year US yields rose by nearly 1.5 bps to 3.90% following a rise of around 1 bps last week.

At the time of writing, the US Dollar Index was up around 0.25% as it was noted at 98.10; the Index extended its rally to the sixth straight day.

The Index has recovered around 1.80% from its cycle-low of 96.37, lowest since February 2022, which was reached on July 1. However, it is still down over 9% this year.

Data roundup:

China's trade data (June) were released on July 14. Trade balance at $114.77 billion topped the estimate of $112.01 billion as both imports (1.1% Vs the forecast of 0.2%) and exports (5.80% Vs the forecast of 5%) beat the forecasts.

ETF and COMEX inventory:

Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 91.017MOz, down slightly in the last two weeks; however, holdings continue to hover around 2-year high and are up 9.84% YTD.

As of July 11, COMEX Gold inventory stood at 36.74 MOz, down 18.48% from the record level of 45.07MOz noted on April 4. Inventories dwindle as investors opt for physical delivery.

As of July 11, total known global silver ETF holdings stood at 774.430MOz, as ETFs recorded net inflows for the ninth straight week. Global ETF holdings are up over 58Moz (1812 tons) this year and have risen 8.14% YTD.

COMEX silver inventory at 494.19 MOz is down around 2% from the all-time high level of 505 MOz noted on May 12.

Trump once again asks Fed's Powell to step down:

Trump and his allies have turned up heat on the Fed Chair Powell over the issue of Federal Reserve's headquarters renovation, which has a cost estimate of $2.50 billion, and is being considered as an extravagant expense. Trump, calling Powell bad for the economy, has once again repeated that Powell should step down.

Upcoming data:

July 15 is a data-packed day as China's 2Q GDP, retail sales (June), industrial production (June) home prices (June) and property data (June) will be released.

Traders will look forward to US CPI data (June), too, as they try to assess the probability and quantum of rate cuts in the coming months, though June CPI data are expected to be hotter-than-May data.

Other crucial US data to be released this week include PPI (June), retail sales advance (June), housing starts (June), University of Michigan sentiment and both short-term and long-term inflation expectations along with import and export price indices (June).

Gold Price Outlook:

In the very short-term, spot gold is expected to move majorly on tariff news flow.

President Trump repeatedly calling Powell to step down undermines the independence of the Fed, which is also supportive for the metal.

The US may not be able to reach trade deals with major economies anytime soon, though risk assets holding well in the face of tariff threats shows that investors hope that trade wars are likely to be contained.

Today’s US CPI data may strengthen the US Dollar further, though, overall, the upside is limited.

We think that Trump is going to up the ante in trade wars as risk assets remain elevated.

It is advisable to buy gold with a stoploss below $3290 (Rs 95,900). The metal is likely to rise on safe haven demand due to tariff concerns and the Fed’s independence issue. Resistance is seen at $3375 (Rs 98,500)/$3405 (Rs 99,400).

Silver Price Outlook:

Silver is expected to get support on the concerns that Trump may impose tariffs on silver imports from Mexico. It is to be noted that Mexico accounted for 44% of US silver imports.

In 2024, the US imported nearly 4,200 tons of silver as the nation is the largest importer of silver.

Silver is also supported by supply concerns emanating from LBMA as elevated silver ETF holdings have reduced the availability of the metal. The annualized cost to borrow the metal for one month has surged to over 6%.

Silver is likely to trade with a positive bias unless the risk appetite gets soured due to intensification of trade wars.

Buying the dips with a stop-loss below $37.50 (Rs 110,000) for a target of $40 (Rs 117,000) is the preferred strategy in the very short-term. The grey metal is expected to rise to $42 (Rs 123,000) in the coming weeks.

Gold price prediction today: Even as gold prices climb, it is silver prices which are in focus after hitting record highs.

China GDP growth beats estimates!

China’s economy slowed slightly in the last quarter as US President Donald Trump’s trade war intensified, but still managed to expand at a solid 5.2% pace, the government said on Tuesday.On a quarterly basis, the world’s second-largest economy grew by 1.1%, slightly above the 0.9% rise forecast, according to National Bureau of Statistics data cited by Reuters.This pace marked a slight dip from the 5.4% annual growth recorded between January and March.The Chinese economy posted a 5.3% annual growth rate, in the first half of the year overall.A major boost came from robust export growth. On Monday, China said its exports rose 5.8% in June compared to the same month last year, up from May’s 4.8% increase.A temporary reprieve from the steep US tariffs on Chinese goods triggered a wave of orders from businesses and consumers, as trade talks between the two countries resumed. Chinese companies also stepped up exports through offshore manufacturing and trade with other countries, helping cushion the blow of the Trump administration’s tariff hikes.“Generally speaking, with the more proactive and effective macro policies taking effect ... the national economy maintained steady growth with good momentum, showcasing strong resilience and vitality,” the National Bureau of Statistics said in its report.Still, a 0.1% drop in consumer prices in the first half of 2025 signalled persistent weakness in domestic demand, a longstanding concern for the ruling communist Party.","China's economy grew by 1.1% in the last quarter, slightly above the 0.9% forecast.

NEW DELHI: The Indian economy is expected to grow at 6.5 per cent in the current financial year, despite geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainties, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) chairman S Mahendra Dev said on Tuesday.Dev further said that domestic growth will be driven by low inflation, resulting from good monsoon and benign interest rate regime, triggered by three back-to-back rate cuts by RBI. ""There are significant global headwinds like the twin shocks of geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainties. However, the Indian economy is resilient and continues to be the fastest growing country among large economies,"" the economist said.According to Dev, high-frequency indicators for the first two months of 2025-26 indicate resilient performance of the domestic economy. ""A 6.5 per cent of GDP growth for FY26 is feasible despite global uncertainties. India's medium-term growth prospects seem to be robust with sound fiscal management.""Dev also emphasised that rising government capital expenditure will have positive impact on growth, with a healthy expansion in private consumption.

MUMBAI: Tesla is finally here. The electric car giant run by Elon Musk opened its first India showroom in Mumbai's BKC on Tuesday. Musk had set his eyes on India since at least 2015, but high tariffs, limited flexibility, and charging infrastructure challenges, kept Tesla away from the country, which the company had described as a hard market.While bookings opened on Tuesday, deliveries of Model Y SUVs, prices for which start at Rs 61-lakh on-road (500km range), will begin in Oct. A 'long-range' (622km) Model Y variant will be available from Jan 2026 with an on-road price tag of just over Rs 69 lakh. For context, BMW iX1 LWB electric SUV is priced at about Rs 51 lakh on-road, and Mercedes-Benz EQA electric SUV costs just over Rs 70 lakh.Users will have a simple 'plug and charge experience' with superchargers adding up to 267km range in 15 minutes.

It features a touchscreen interface, 'autopilot' driver-assistance, and over-the-air software updates for the car,"" a Tesla executive said at the launch.Model Y's features include a bumper camera that covers blind spots during rides.At present, Tesla EVs sold in India will be imported and have limited 'autopilot' features - automatic emergency braking system, lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control.Tesla's experience centre at BKC, where Apple opened its first store in 2023, is seen as a way to test the waters with its retail strategy - to evaluate consumer interest and market potential. Tesla is now preparing to expand its presence by opening a showroom in Delhi.

The time taken has also fallen from 93 days to 17.""The massive increase in tax refunds and decrease in the number of days to issue refunds is due to improvements in tax administration, especially with the adoption of digital infrastructure, including end-to-end online filing and faceless assessment that enables faster and more accurate processing of income tax returns.The introduction of pre-filled returns, automation in refund processing, real-time TDS adjustments, and online grievance redress mechanisms has led to reduced delays and improved taxpayer experience,"" said a source.Refunds as a proportion of gross tax collections were estimated at 17.6 per cent during the last financial year, compared with 11.5 per cent in 2013-2014. ""It is a reflection of increased formalisation and voluntary participation in the tax system.As the taxpayer base expands and advance tax payments and TDS mechanisms deepen, excess remittances become more common. The growing volume and share of refunds are thus not merely a statistical trend but a meaningful signal of systemic maturity.It demonstrates that India's tax ecosystem is now firmly aligned with the principles of efficiency, transparency, and taxpayer facilitation,"" a source argued.Even so far during the current fiscal year, there has been no let-up in refunds despite muted growth in gross collections. Direct tax collections are 3.2 per cent higher in the financial year up to July 10, but refunds were pegged 38 per cent higher, resulting in a fall in net collections.In the past, the government would often go slow on refunds to ensure that net collections were not impacted.But the Modigovernment has gone ahead with refunds, acknowledging that stopping it holds up cash flow for businesses, impacting overall economic activity.", improvement in tax administration has resulted in a five-fold jump in income tax refunds.

'Unthinkable Trade Barriers Must Go'- Donald Trump Warns India Ahead of US Trade Deal Deadline

Why Are US Dry Fruits Facing Delayed Customs Clearance?

India levies a 100% duty on US walnuts, both shelled and unshelled, alongside specific duties of ₹35 per kilogram on almonds in shell and ₹100/kg on almond kernels.

This taxation structure is frequently spoken of by Trump to substantiate his claim that India has a high tariff regime.

Indian importers of dry fruit expect a significant reduction of approximately 50% in import duties as part of the India-US trade deal.

Industry insiders told the financial daily that importers are looking to prevent potential financial losses that could occur if duty rates decrease after they have cleared goods at current tariffs. However, this cautious approach might lead to further supply chain disruptions.

India-US trade deal talks impact: Even as India and the US look to finalise a trade deal ahead of US President Donald Trump’s tariff deadline, the possibility of an agreement has led to delays in clearance for American dry fruits.According to an ET report, in anticipation of a drastic cut in import duties, importers of dry fruits in India are delaying customs clearances. Dry fruit importers are delaying customs clearance of walnuts, almonds and other nuts from the US due to ambiguity surrounding the proposed India-US trade agreement.Also Read | ‘Very fast pace….’: India-US trade deal talks pick momentum ahead of Trump’s deadline; Piyush Goyal shares important update ""Two commodities that are likely to see duty reduction in the proposed US-India trade deal are walnuts and almonds,"" said Ravindra Mehta, founding member at Nuts and Dry Fruits Council of India, or NDFC(I) according to the report.""Many importers are postponing filing the bill of entry by a few days and opting to pay the penalty for delayed clearance, which is much smaller than the losses they may face in case the duties are reduced,"" he said.The dry fruit market is already experiencing supply constraints due to the suspension of Afghan imports, following the closure of the Wagah border after Operation Sindoor strikes targeting terror facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.","Dry fruit importers are delaying customs clearance of walnuts, almonds and other nuts from the US due to ambiguity surrounding the proposed India-US trade agreement.

The announcement signals an escalation in his broader “reciprocal tariff” strategy, set to formally take effect from 1 August.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday (local time) after attending an AI summit in Pittsburgh, Trump said, “Probably at the end of the month, and we’re going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we’re going to make it a very high tariff.”He added that tariffs on semiconductors were on a “similar” timeline and would be “less complicated” to enforce, Bloomberg reported.Earlier this month, Trump had already pledged a 50% tariff on copper and warned that pharmaceutical tariffs could rise as high as 200% after a one-year grace period for companies to shift production back to the US.His administration is pursuing these tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, claiming that the volume of drug imports poses a national security threat.If enacted, the pharmaceutical levies could directly impact multinational drugmakers such as Eli Lilly, Merck, and Pfizer, who rely heavily on overseas production. Meanwhile, chip tariffs are expected to affect not only semiconductor manufacturers but also consumer tech giants like Apple and Samsung, potentially driving up prices for smartphones and laptops.The threat comes as Trump has issued tariff letters to several trading partners in recent days, outlining import duties unilaterally, though he insists negotiations are still on the table.Earlier on Tuesday, Trump also announced a revised deal with Indonesia, cutting its proposed tariff rate from 32% to 19%, in exchange for multibillion-dollar US purchases, including 50 Boeing aircraft.",US President Donald Trump said he is likely to impose tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals by the end of the month.

US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday (local time) that he is planning to impose tariffs of over 10 per cent on goods from smaller countries, including nations in Africa and the Caribbean, news agency AP reported.""We'll probably set one tariff for all of them,"" Trump told reporters, explaining that the rate could be “a little over 10 percent” on imports from at least 100 countries.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that the countries affected would be primarily in Africa and the Caribbean. He further added that these regions generally have low levels of trade with the United States and would not significantly help Trump’s broader goal of reducing America’s overall trade deficit.Earlier this month, the president sent notices to around two dozen countries and the European Union announcing new tariff rates that will take effect on August 1. These new rates are generally similar to the import taxes announced on April 2, which were among the highest in recent US history. The initial announcement caused concern in financial markets, leading the administration to set a 90-day period for negotiations that ended on July 9.Trump also said he would “probably” announce new tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs by the end of the month. He explained that these tariffs would start at a lower rate, giving companies one year to build factories in the United States before facing higher import taxes. He said computer chips would also face similar tariffs.Earlier, Trump had announced a trade agreement with Indonesia significantly reducing tariffs on Indonesian exports to 19% and granting full market access to American goods.",US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he is planning to impose tariffs of over 10 per cent on goods from smaller countries.

"Donald Trump vs Federal Reserve: Why a 1% Fed rate cut could backfire, fuel inflation, and rattle markets — here’s what economists say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-vs-federal-reserve-why-a-1-fed-rate-cut-could-backfire-fuel-inflation-and-rattle-markets-heres-what-economists-say/articleshow/122523113.cms,"US President Donald Trump ’s renewed call for the Federal Reserve to slash its benchmark interest rate to 1% in a bid to ease government borrowing costs and finance rising deficits could backfire, according to a detailed Reuters analysis. Economists warn the move risks inflaming inflation expectations, undermining Fed credibility and triggering a bond market backlash.Trump, who has championed deficit-financed tax cuts and spending increases under his ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"", has suggested that a 1% interest rate would allow his administration to sustain higher government debt without raising borrowing costs.But analysts argue that such a drastic rate cut — down from the current 4.25–4.50% range — would signal a crisis response in an economy that is still growing steadily, with inflation running at 2.5% and unemployment at 4.1%.“A Fed policy rate that low is not typically a sign that the US is the ‘hottest’ country in the world for investment,” the Reuters report noted. Instead, it has historically been associated with economic distress — including the aftermath of the 2001 attacks, the 2008 global financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic.Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, warned that slashing rates to 1% under current economic conditions would likely trigger fears that the Fed was bowing to political pressure.“The bond market fear would be that inflation would reignite and essentially we would have a loss of Fed independence and a de-anchoring of inflation expectations,” he was quoted as saying.While there may be some scope to ease rates modestly, a deep cut as Trump demands could erode confidence in the Fed’s commitment to its dual mandate — price stability and full employment — especially as inflation remains above target.The Fed influences borrowing costs through the federal funds rate, but it does not control interest rates on US Treasuries directly. These are determined by global markets, factoring in demand, supply, inflation expectations, and term premiums. Any perception of fiscal indiscipline or political interference could push Treasury yields higher, offsetting any benefits from lower short-term rates.Trump's push for lower rates comes amid rising US deficits and debt, driven in part by tax cuts and new spending proposals. The Reuters report notes that the US still enjoys relatively low borrowing costs due to global trust in its institutions and the dollar’s safe-haven status — but this trust could erode if market participants perceive a weakening of Fed independence.Central bankers are also wary of the inflationary risks posed by Trump’s new wave of tariffs on major trading partners, including the EU and Mexico. Slashing rates without clear signs of economic slowdown or disinflation could be seen as reckless.""Exits and repatriation are part of the process and indicates a sign of a mature market,"" Daco noted, stressing that data does not support a drastic shift in monetary policy.Trump reportedly sent Fed Chair Jerome Powell a handwritten note with his preferred interest rate penciled in — close to 1%. However, any move by the central bank in that direction without data-based justification could trigger a loss of credibility, higher inflation expectations, and even capital flight, economists warn.","US President Donald Trump has called for the Federal Reserve to slash its benchmark interest rate to 1% in a bid to ease government borrowing costs and finance rising deficits.

Huang meets Chinese officials

Industry pressures lead to policy shift

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company has secured approval from the Trump administration to begin selling its advanced H20 chips to China, paving the way for resumed exports of its AI hardware to a key international market.“The US government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon,” the company said in a blog post on Monday. Huang, currently in Beijing, also confirmed the development on Chinese state-run CGTN and in remarks shared on social platform X, AP reported.“Today, I'm announcing that the US government has approved for us filing licenses to start shipping H20s,” Huang told reporters in Beijing. “It's so innovative and dynamic here in China that it's really important that American companies are able to compete and serve the market here in China,” he added, noting that half the world’s AI researchers are based in China.Huang is in China to attend a supply chain conference and meet with local officials. CGTN aired footage of him meeting Ren Hongbin, chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and organiser of the China International Supply Chain Expo, where Nvidia is one of the exhibitors.The approval comes after Huang’s meeting with President Donald Trump and other US policymakers. The move follows export restrictions earlier this year that blocked sales of high-end AI chips, including Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308, to China.The April decision to restrict chip exports had raised concerns across the tech industry. Nvidia warned the curbs would cost the company an estimated $5.5 billion in revenue.

Kennedy also hinted at upcoming dietary guidelines that will “elevate” dairy, including full-fat products, to reflect their contribution to children’s health.Dr Marty Makary, head of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), also revealed that the agency has approved a new plant-based dye, “gardenia blue”, which may serve as a natural alternative.The health benefits of full-fat dairy remain contested. While longstanding guidance has warned against excessive intake of saturated fats, sugars and refined grains, a growing number of researchers argue that full-fat dairy may not be as harmful as once believed.This view is echoed by the dairy industry, which has invested heavily in nutrition research and pushed back on government restrictions on dairy in school meals since the Obama era.In rural farming communities, the debate is more than academic. Farmers have displayed hand-painted hay bales with slogans such as “Drink whole milk 97% fat free,” underlining the cultural and economic importance of dairy in these regions.The Trump administration’s close ties with the dairy sector are well-documented. Back in 2019, former agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue famously toasted dairy lobbyists with chocolate milk to mark the return of flavoured milk to school cafeterias.“This is a great day for dairy and a great day for ‘make America healthy again,’” said Michael Dykes, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association. “We’re so happy with the voluntary industry-led commitment.”Still, the administration’s preference for voluntary deals has met resistance elsewhere. Kennedy’s efforts to secure similar commitments from confectionery giant Mars, maker of Skittles and M&M’s, fell flat.Health experts have also raised doubts on whether voluntary pacts with private health insurers will deliver meaningful change for Americans.","The US dairy industry has agreed to voluntarily remove synthetic dyes from ice- cream products.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

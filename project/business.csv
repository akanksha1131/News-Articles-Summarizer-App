Strengthening Water Treatment Infrastructure Ensuring Clean and Safe Drinking Water

Such toxic water poses grave health hazards: Ex-CM

NEW DELHI: Responding to the Election Commission’s notice seeking “evidence” to support his allegation that the BJP govt in Haryana was “poisoning” Delhi’s water supply in the run-up to the Feb 5 polls, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal has said that the raw water received from the upper riparian state had been “highly contaminated and (is) extremely poisonous” for human health.This, he said, was also proved by a letter written by the DJB CEO to the chief secretary of the capital in which she had admitted that the level of ammonia in the Yamuna water was 6.5ppm while DJB water treatment plants were designed to treat up to 1pm.Late Wednesday night, EC sources said they were examining the reply but pointed out that it seems to have glossed over the central issue of substantiating the charge of “poisoning” of the water.Late Wednesday night, EC source said Kejriwal had fallen back on the complaint of increased ammonia levels which has already been raised by the Delhi and Punjab chief ministers and which EC is considering separately. The poll body has already asked Haryana govt for a report on the matter.An EC official said Kejriwal’s response did not contain any proof of “poisoning” of the river water by an elected state govt with the intention to kill the residents of Delhi, details of the poisoning agent, or how, when and which engineers at DJB had detected the poison and stopped the “poisoned” waters on the Delhi border. DJB had issued a denial of these claims, call them “false, misleading and factually incorrect”.EC’s letter asking Kejriwal to explain his “serious and unprecedented” charge against an elected govt had said, “…as regards the allegations of poisoning, it is expected that there must be a factual foundation to the allegations. Especially when the veracity of the statements made by you is contested, then you must be able to back your statements on a factual basis.” The reply had been sought following complaints from BJP and Congress.In his 14-page response to EC, the former Delhi chief minister has said that DJB’s CEO had identified indiscriminate discharge of industrial waste by Haryana as the root cause behind high toxicity in Yamuna water, and the state’s failure in controll ing pollution had resulted in an unprecedented public health crisis.He added that this issue had been raised earlier too and DJB had approached NGT and Supreme Court seeking relief. The consumption of such toxic water may lead to grave health hazards and fatality, Kejriwal said, adding that safe drinking water was a basic human right and raising the issue for society cannot be termed as an offence.He said the situation needed immediate institutional and govt intervention, and by no stretch of imagination could raising the issue be termed as “inciting enmity between different groups or prejudicial to national integration”.Referring to the high ammonia level in the Yamuna at the Wazirabad pond, from where the water treatment plants get supply of raw water, Kejriwal had on Monday accused Haryana of mixing “poison” in the river water and alleged that there was an “attempt of genocide” in the national capital.Kejriwal added that the ingestion of ammonia-contam inated water at elevated concentrations posed a severe and multifaceted health hazard and may lead to neurological impairment and encephalopathy, liver and kidney dysfunction, infant mortality risk and bacterial outbreaks.“Any failure to mitigate this contamination places millions of lives at immediate risk and constitutes a grave violation of the fundamental right to health under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” he said.Referring to various judgments delivered by SC, Kejriwal argued in his letter that his statements did not attract Sections 196 (promoting enmity between different groups), 197 (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 353 (statements conducing to public mischief) of BNS Act; Section 123(4) (corrupt practices-publication of false statements) of the Representation of the People’s Act, 1951; and the model code of conduct.Instead, he said, his statements were “fully protected” under the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and expression. “As per the law laid down by Supreme Court in similar matters, the effect of the said statement has to be seen and judged from the standard of reasonable and strongminded men and not weak vacillating minds,” he said. “Terming it as an offence has grave consequences for democracy and polity in India and causes a chilling effect on the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression…” he added.He said the chief ministers of Delhi and Punjab will write a letter to EC seeking an urgent meeting and intervention.“Any attempt to suppress discourse on such an alarming public health crisis is not only antithetical to democratic principles but also constitutes a direct affront to the citizens’ right to demand remedial action from the state,” he added.Kejriwal said his statement neither referred to, nor imputed anything against the personal character or conduct of any candidate contesting the elections and urged EC to close the issue.",Arvind Kejriwal says raw water received from upper riparian state had been “highly contaminated and (is) extremely poisonous” for human health. Kejriwal says DJB CEO admitted that the level of ammonia in the Yamuna water was 6.5ppm while DJB water treatment plants were designed to treat up to 1pm.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117714040,imgsize-18108,width-400,resizemode-4/117714040.jpg"

Inflation pressures persist



Donald Trump inherits a healthy economy



Global comparison



The US economy wrapped up 2024 on a solid note, with consumer spending and government support playing key roles in driving growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department.Despite some challenges, the economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected. For the full year, GDP grew by 2.8%, a strong performance, although slightly down from the 2.9% growth in 2023.Consumer spending rose by 4.2% in the final quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since early 2023. This growth was up from 3.7% in the previous quarter. The economy also benefitted from government spending and continued investment, although business investment slowed, particularly in equipment spending, which fell sharply after two strong quarters.Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, said, ""Consumers have been the foundation of the economy, and they've been the biggest driver of resilient growth in 2024,"" as quoted by the AFP news agency. He believes this growth will continue, supported by low layoffs, healthy job growth, and rising wages.The report also showed ongoing inflation. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, increased by 2.5%, slightly up from 2.2% in the previous quarter.Despite these inflation pressures, the economy remained strong. A key part of GDP, which excludes volatile items like exports and inventories, grew by 3.2% in the third quarter, down from 3.4% in the previous quarter.President Donald Trump, who took office in January 2025, inherited a strong economy, with growth continuing despite high interest rates. Unemployment was 4.1% in December, and job gains stayed steady. The Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged in December, after cutting it three times since September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell was quoted as saying to the Associated Press, “We do not need to be in a hurry to make more cuts,” due to the economy’s strength.The US economy is growing strongly, while Europe is struggling, having seen zero growth at the end of last year. The European Central Bank recently lowered its benchmark rate due to weak performance. In the US, strong consumer spending, low unemployment, and rising wages have helped maintain growth, despite ongoing inflation concerns.Trump has promised to cut taxes and reduce business regulations, but his plans on tariffs and immigration might slow growth and raise prices. KPMG's chief economist, Diane Swonk, pointed out that the effects of these policies will take time. While some analysts expect growth to slow in 2025, they still believe the US economy will remain strong for now.","US economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected. Consumer spending rose by 4.2% in final quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since early 2023.

Tesla results miss estimates as company projects 2025 auto volume growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-results-miss-estimates-as-company-projects-2025-auto-volume-growth/articleshow/117716151.cms,"Full autonomy soon?

Tesla reported lower than expected profits Wednesday but confirmed key 2025 benchmarks, saying it will return to sales volume growth and move forward with fully autonomous driving.The results -- the first since the return of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ally Donald Trump to the White House -- capped a mixed year for Tesla in which Musk's big bet on US electoral politics was countered by profit pressures as Tesla's streak of annual car volume growth came to an end.The electric car company reported fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter, where profits were boosted by a one-time tax benefit.Revenues rose two percent to $25.7 billion, also missing analyst estimates, but reflecting a more than doubling of sales in energy generation and storage.Musk has sought to temper expectations about Tesla's near-term financial growth, while employing superlatives in touting Tesla's autonomous driving and robotic ventures, saying they could make Tesla ""the most valuable company in the world by far,"" worth more than the ""next five companies combined.""Musk, who spent some $270 million or more to help Trump win the White House, largely steered clear of political subjects during the 65-minute conference call.The company has been confronted by intensifying EV competition in leading markets, including China and the United States, where General Motors and Ford have introduced more models.Another factor has been lower sales than expected from the Cybertruck, Musk's futuristic auto giant that has won cheers from Tesla fans and jeers from critics.But Tesla expects growth in 2025, saying in its earnings release that ""with the advancements in vehicle autonomy and the introduction of new products, we expect the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025.""The company confirmed plans to unveil new, more affordable vehicles in 2025 and said its launch of a new robotaxi venture in parts of the United States was on track to begin this year.Tesla named its driver-assistance programs ""autopilot"" and ""full self-driving"" (FSD), even though the programs require the driver to maintain attention, while rival robotaxi venture Waymo has achieved full driverless functionality in three US cities so far.Musk has repeatedly missed earlier targets towards full autonomy, quipping during Wednesday that he was like the boy who cried wolf.""But I'm telling you, there's a damn wolf this time, and you can drive it,"" Musk said. ""In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf.""Musk said he intends to launch FSD as a paid service in Austin, Texas this year, where the company also plans to introduce robotaxi services.""Teslas will be in the wild,"" he said, describing a gradual expansion of service once the company can demonstrate its autonomous service is ""unequivocally safer"" than a human driver.Musk did not directly comment on how his alliance with Trump will affect Tesla.The billionaire's widening influence and activism on behalf of far-right political movements has drawn rising attention and blowback. Polling data released Wednesday by YouGov showed Musk with a 44 percent favorable public opinion compared with a 48 percent negative.That's a worse ratio than Trump, who came in at three points net-positive, according to YouGov.A coalition that includes a public workers union has filed a lawsuit to block Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, arguing the panel flouts federal laws and is ""beset"" by the conflicts of interest of an extremist ""libertarian billionaire class.""And only days after being criticized for a hand gesture at Trump's inauguration that resembled a Nazi salute, Musk drew scrutiny last weekend for reiterating support for Germany's far-right, anti-immigrant AfD party, including comments that young Germans should feel able ""to move beyond"" expressing regret for the Holocaust.During the call, Musk's most overtly political comment concerned what he described as the cumbersome process to introduce FSD in Europe, calling Europe ""a layer cake of regulations and bureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed.""Shares of Tesla rose 4.4 percent in after-hours trading.","Tesla reports fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter.

'DeepSeek DID NOT build OpenAI for USD 5M' : Bernstein dismisses the Chinese company's claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/deepseek-did-not-build-openai-for-usd-5m-bernstein-dismisses-the-chinese-companys-claims/articleshow/117678472.cms,"Was it really $ 5 million?

DeepSeek, a new AI company seen as a potential rival to OpenAI, has gained massive success across social media, sending global stock markets into a frenzy. However, a recent report by Bernstein cautioned that while the company’s achievements are impressive, the claims of building an AI system comparable to OpenAI for just $5 million are not true.The report said that the claim is misleading and does not reflect the bigger picture.Bernstein stated, ""We believe that DeepSeek DID NOT ""build OpenAI for USD 5M""; the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and the resulting Twitter-verse panic over the weekend seems overblown"".The report said that DeepSeek developed two main AI models: the DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek R1. The V3 model, a large language model, utilises a mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture, which combines multiple smaller models to achieve high performance while using fewer computing resources than traditional large models.On the other hand, the V3 model boasts 671 billion parameters, with 37 billion active at any given time, and incorporated with innovations like multi-head latent attention (MHLA) to reduce memory usage and mixed-precision training with FP8 computation for greater efficiency.Training the V3 model involved a cluster of 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs over a two-month period which sums up around 5.5 million GPU hours.While some estimates put the training cost at approximately $ 5 million, the report highlighted that this figure only considers the computational resources, leaving out the significant costs related to research, experimentation, and other developmental expenses.The DeepSeek R1 model builds upon the V3’s foundation by using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and other techniques to enhance reasoning capabilities. The R1 model has performed competitively with OpenAI’s models in reasoning tasks. However, Bernstein pointed out that the additional resources required to develop the R1 model were substantial, though not detailed in DeepSeek’s research paper.Commenting on the hype, Bernstein noted that DeepSeek's models are impressive.For example, the V3 model performs as well as or better than other large models in language, coding, and mathematics while consuming a fraction of the computational resources. Pre-training the V3 model required just 2.7 million GPU hours, or only 9 per cent of the compute resources needed for some leading models.In conclusion, while DeepSeek’s advancements are noteworthy, the report urged caution in the face of exaggerated claims. While the company’s work is groundbreaking, the notion of creating an OpenAI competitor for just $ 5 million appears to be false.","DeepSeek, a new AI company seen as a potential rival to OpenAI, has gained massive success across social media, sending global stock markets into a frenzy.

Despite inflation easing, the RBA’s official cash rate remains at 4.35 per cent, where it has sat since November 2023, according to news agency The Guardian.The last rate cut occurred in November 2020 as part of efforts to support the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.While inflation has not dropped as quickly as the RBA had hoped, it has steadily declined from its peak of 7.8 per cent in 2022, when Australian households struggled with soaring prices for essential goods.Analysts believe that the RBA may now have room to ease its monetary policy to prevent a downturn in the job market and avoid tipping the economy into recession.Saxo Bank’s Asia Pacific senior sales trader Junvum Kim said, “This softer-than-expected inflation data could amplify expectations for a February RBA rate cut and bolster the Reserve Bank’s confidence in steering inflation back to its target within a reasonable timeframe.”With Australia’s federal election due by May, the cost-of-living crisis remains a key issue for voters. Polling remains tight, and recent elections have shown that governments need strong policies to address financial pressures if they hope to stay in power.The financial markets were already biding in an 84 per cent chance of a 0.25 per cent cut ahead of the latest inflation data release, raising expectations for a policy shift in the coming weeks.The Australian dollar, which usually falls with the interest rates and vice versa, also fell from a little more than 62.5 US cents to 62.3 US cents.","The Reserve Bank of Australia ’s (RBA) preferred inflation measure, which excludes volatile price swings, dropped to an annual 3.2 per cent for the December quarter.

Three years ago, Liang Wenfeng 's quantitative hedge fund firm apologised profusely to investors for losing money during a tumultuous period for China's stock market.It was a surprising stumble for Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management , which used artificial intelligence to pick stocks and had grown rapidly to become one of the country's largest quant funds. As the firm navigated through that crisis and its assets shrunk by more than a third from a peak of more than $12 billion, behind the scenes Liang was laying the groundwork for a new AI startup, DeepSeek .DeepSeek, which grew out of High-Flyer, is now threatening to upend the global AI supply chain and challenge the seemingly-unassailable US lead in critical frontier AI technologies. The sudden popularity of the 20-month-old firm's breakthrough technology and its namesake app sparked a massive US and European stock rout on Monday, wiping out close to $1 trillion in combined market value from chip giant Nvidia and other peers.It has also drawn shock and awe over how Liang, an engineering graduate who has never studied or worked outside of mainland China, pulled off such a feat. He has demonstrated that with local artificial intelligence engineers, constrained access to the latest semiconductor technologies and limited resources, it is possible to match - and even surpass - the best in the field.The question now gripping investors, companies and policymakers is whether artificial intelligence requires hundreds of billions of dollars in capital expenditure to come up with the latest innovations and vanguard AI models - and whether export controls can hold off Chinese competition.Liang has been compared to OpenAI founder Sam Altman, but the Chinese citizen keeps a much lower profile and seldom speaks publicly. ""OpenAI is not a god and cannot always be at the forefront,"" Liang told Chinese media outlet 36Kr in July 2024.The previous year, Liang said more investment doesn't necessarily lead to more innovation. He has also opined on how Chinese companies have long been mostly followers as opposed to technology innovators. The problem has been a ""lack of confidence and not knowing how to organize high-density talents to achieve effective innovation,"" he was quoted as saying.Liang was born in 1985 in Zhanjiang, an economically poor city in China's southern Guangdong province. His father was an elementary school teacher. He studied electronic engineering at Zhejiang University, a prestigious college in the city of Hangzhou, and also earned a master's degree in information and communication engineering there.DeepSeek's research was funded by High-Flyer's R&D budget, Liang said previously. It drew computing resources from the quant fund, which had amassed 10,000 Nvidia GPUs in 2021, prior to US bans on exports of sophisticated Nvidia chips and GPUs.Liang recruited engineering talent almost exclusively from China. Many were fresh out of top universities, interns in their final leg of doctoral studies and Olympiad medal holders. bloomberg","Liang Wenfeng's quantitative hedge fund firm apologised profusely to investors for losing money during a tumultuous period for China's stock market.

Coca-Cola has recalled certain batches of its soft drinks across Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands after routine safety checks at its Ghent production plant revealed higher-than-normal levels of chlorate. The affected products include Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite, Minute Maid, and Fuze Tea, with production codes ranging from 328 GE to 338 GE.Chlorate, a byproduct of chlorine disinfectants used in water treatment, can potentially disrupt thyroid function, especially in children. The European Union's rapid alert system notified health authorities in Denmark, Portugal, and Romania to investigate whether contaminated drinks had reached store shelves or vending machines in those countries. The risk was categorised as ""serious.""Coca-Cola has assured consumers that the issue was traced to a single container used in the water treatment process at its Ghent facility. The company has urged customers not to consume drinks from the affected batches and to return them for refunds. ""We apologise to consumers and our commercial partners,"" Coca-Cola said in a statement.While the recall raised concerns, experts have reassured the public. Philippe Jorens, a professor at Antwerp University Hospital, told Belgian public broadcaster VTM that consuming harmful levels of chlorate from the affected drinks would require ingesting significant quantities.In addition, a small number of potentially contaminated drinks were shipped to France, Germany, and Great Britain, but no recalls were issued in those countries. “We are also in contact with authorities in a very small number of European markets – France, Germany, and Great Britain – where a very limited quantity of stock was also shipped,” the company said.","Routine safety checks at its Ghent production plant revealed higher-than-normal levels of chlorate.

Poll Is DeepSeek's AI Technology Superior to Other Available AI Tools? No, It Still Has a Long Way to Go Yes, It’s a Game Changer

The trigger?

Why it matters

DeepSeek’s announcement is more than a technological milestone—it’s a direct challenge to Silicon Valley’s dominance in AI. For years, US companies like OpenAI and Google have relied on their ability to spend billions on AI infrastructure and development, creating an almost unassailable competitive moat. Nvidia’s dominance in AI chips has fueled a skyrocketing valuation, with its GPUs seen as indispensable for training large language models (LLMs).

But DeepSeek’s revelation threatens to undercut this economic model. By demonstrating that high-performing AI models can be developed cheaply using fewer resources, the company has thrown into question the sustainability of these enormous capital expenditures. If the cost of training AI drops significantly, demand for high-end GPUs, advanced data centers, and specialized cloud services could fall, upending the financial prospects of US tech titans.

A $1 trillion fallout

The rise of DeepSeek

Are the DeepSeek fears real?

DeepSeek’s “Sputnik moment”

The scale and efficiency of DeepSeek’s breakthrough have led to comparisons with the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik in 1957—a moment that catalyzed the space race. Silicon Valley heavyweight Marc Andreessen called the R1 model “AI’s Sputnik moment” and “one of the most amazing breakthroughs” in the field. Even President Donald Trump weighed in, describing the development as a “wake-up call” for US industries. “Instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same solution,” he said.

Zhou Hongyi , the CEO of Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, declared that the company had “upended the world.” Others called it proof that China was closing the gap with the U.S. in AI technology. The breakthrough has renewed confidence in Beijing’s ability to outmaneuver U.S. sanctions and technological barriers.

Skepticism and controversy

Impact on Silicon Valley’s AI giants

Nvidia Stock Beaten Down Due to DeepSeek

The new economics of AI

Geopolitical implications

A turning point for markets

For over two years, artificial intelligence (AI) has driven one of the most dramatic stock market rallies in history. Nvidia, the chipmaking giant and cornerstone of the AI revolution, became synonymous with the soaring optimism surrounding AI’s potential to reshape industries. Yet, on Monday, this euphoria came to a screeching halt. Nvidia suffered a historic $589 billion loss in market value—the largest one-day drop for a company in Wall Street history—sparking widespread panic in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and wiping nearly $1 trillion from global markets.A Chinese startup called DeepSeek , which last week announced a breakthrough in AI technology that threatens to upend the economics of the industry. The Hangzhou-based company introduced its R1 AI model, claiming it could rival the most advanced models from Silicon Valley titans like OpenAI and Google—for a fraction of the cost. The disruptive potential of DeepSeek’s innovation rattled investor confidence, sending ripples through the global tech ecosystem.Monday’s selloff was nothing short of catastrophic. Nvidia’s stock plummeted 17%, marking its lowest point since October and shaving billions off the fortunes of its investors. CEO Jensen Huang alone lost $21 billion from his net worth. Broadcom, another major player in AI chips, saw its shares fall 17.4%, while Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta faced declines ranging from 2% to 4%. Even power utility firms like Vistra and Constellation Energy, which are critical to the data center infrastructure powering AI, saw their stocks fall by 28.3% and 20.8%, respectively.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3%, dragging down the broader S&P 500 tech sector, which fell 5.6%. This was the sector’s worst one-day decline in over four years. By the end of the day, the global market had shed a staggering $1 trillion in value, a sharp reversal of the AI-driven gains that had propelled stocks to record highs over the past two years.DeepSeek, once an obscure startup, emerged as a serious player in the global AI race last week when it announced the release of its R1 model. According to the company, the R1 model can match the performance of OpenAI’s GPT-4 and other leading models while costing just $5.6 million to develop—a fraction of the hundreds of millions or even billions spent by U.S. firms. The company also claimed to have achieved this feat using Nvidia’s less powerful H800 chips, a move born of necessity due to U.S. export restrictions on more advanced GPUs like the H100.The timing of DeepSeek’s announcement could not have been more significant. Its AI chatbot, integrated with the R1 model, quickly became the most downloaded app on Apple’s US App Store, overtaking OpenAI’s ChatGPT. For Silicon Valley, the implications were clear: China had found a way to compete in the high-stakes AI game without the massive capital investments and infrastructure traditionally required.Despite the dramatic market response, not everyone is convinced of DeepSeek’s claims. Analysts like Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein and Atif Malik of Citigroup have questioned whether the R1 model can truly rival US counterparts at such a low cost. They pointed out that while DeepSeek may have used less advanced hardware, its ability to achieve cutting-edge performance without significant investments in GPUs remains debatable.There are also suspicions about how DeepSeek obtained its hardware. Elon Musk, who has heavily invested in Nvidia chips for his company xAI, speculated that DeepSeek may have acquired banned H100 chips through indirect channels. Alexandr Wang, CEO of Scale AI, echoed this sentiment, claiming that Chinese firms “have more H100s than people think.” Nvidia, however, stated that DeepSeek’s technology was “fully export control compliant.”The broader implications of DeepSeek’s rise are significant for U.S. tech companies. For years, firms like Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI have built their dominance on the premise that AI requires immense capital expenditure. Nvidia, for instance, has sold billions of dollars’ worth of high-end GPUs, becoming a linchpin of the AI revolution. But if DeepSeek’s claims hold, the demand for such hardware could decline, undermining the economic model that has driven the industry’s explosive growth.Nevertheless, some industry leaders see opportunity in DeepSeek’s innovation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the R1 model “an impressive competitor” and pledged to accelerate his company’s product releases. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella argued that cheaper AI would democratize access and drive broader adoption, potentially benefiting the global economy.DeepSeek’s announcement has forced a reevaluation of the economics of AI. For years, the development of large language models (LLMs) has been characterized by ballooning costs and resource-intensive processes. OpenAI’s GPT-4 reportedly cost over $100 million to train, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei suggested that some models are approaching $1 billion in development costs.In contrast, DeepSeek has demonstrated that advanced AI can be developed at a fraction of the cost, potentially reshaping how companies approach AI investments. This shift could benefit smaller players and startups, but it also raises questions about the billions already spent by Silicon Valley giants on data centers and infrastructure.DeepSeek’s success has broader geopolitical ramifications. The US has sought to curb China’s AI development through export controls and sanctions, limiting access to cutting-edge chips and technology. However, DeepSeek’s achievements suggest that these measures have not only failed but may have spurred innovation. By focusing on efficiency and resourcefulness, Chinese firms like DeepSeek are proving that they can compete with—and possibly surpass—their US counterparts.President Trump’s administration may now face pressure to tighten export restrictions further, a move that could escalate tensions with Beijing. At the same time, policymakers will need to consider how to foster innovation at home while maintaining a competitive edge.For investors, Monday’s selloff serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with overexposure to a single narrative. The AI boom, while transformative, has also fueled speculative behavior, with tech stocks reaching valuations that some argue are unsustainable. Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro, urged caution, noting that “panicking rarely makes for a good investment decision.”Yet, others see a silver lining. Lower costs could make AI more accessible, driving widespread adoption across industries and fueling long-term economic growth. As Joseph Amato of Neuberger Berman put it, “If you can invest less for a powerful model that has wider adoption, that’s got to be a good thing for the broad-based economy.”(With inputs from agencies)","A Chinese startup called DeepSeek announced a breakthrough in AI technology that threatens to upend the economics of the industry.

He congratulated DeepSeek, and noted on X: “For a while, it wasn't clear who would beat ChatGPT for the first time. The best we (Perplexity) could manage was #8, a year ago. Look forward to using all their (DeepSeek’s) models for search, assistant, and agents this year.”Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made an indirect reference to it. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, he said, ""We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.""DeepSeek is founded by Liang Wenfeng, who previously founded a hedge fund. What makes its achievement noteworthy has been its ability to make a ChatGPT-class language model at a fraction of ChatGPT’s cost. DeepSeek’s R1 AI model is said to match or even beat the likes of ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini on multiple parameters. What’s more, it’s free, unlike ChatGPT that has a very limited free version.Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the marquee venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and an advisor to US President Donald Trump, described DeepSeek’s accomplishment as “AI’s Sputnik moment,” making a reference to a period of anxiety among Western nations about a possible technological gap between the US and the Soviet Union when the latter launched the Sputnik satellite. Social media platform X was abuzz with DeepSeek around this. While some took potshots at companies such as OpenAI, which was founded 10 years ago, raised about $17.9 billion in funding, and has an employee base of thousands, others cast doubts on DeepSeek’s claims of spending less than $6 million to build R1.US venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya said: “We need to get better at taking huge shots on goal and allocating capital to the best of these ideas. I worry that in this current melee, we’ve overspent billions on dumb features which these next-gen models will roll over in the next 12 months or earlier. Lots of capital losses are coming.” Garry Tan, CEO of famed Silicon Valley-based startup accelerator Y Combinator, said DeepSeek’s search feels more sticky even after a few queries “because seeing the reasoning, even how earnest it is about what it knows and what it might not know, increases user trust by quite a lot.”Vaibhav Domkundwar, founder & CEO of Better Capital, told TOI that R1 is significant because it changes the game entirely. “It is not about proving what its real cost is… we will know a lot more in the coming days, but it will disprove a lot of the narrative pushed by OpenAI and others,” he said.","DeepSeek has soared to the No. 1 spot in Apple's App Store productivity category across major markets including the US, UK, China and India. The app's R1 AI model is said to match or even beat the likes of ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini on multiple parameters.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117621327,imgsize-286964,width-400,resizemode-4/117621327.jpg"

Capital Spending

The world’s 500 richest people, led by Nvidia Corp . co-founder Jensen Huang, lost a combined $108 billion on Monday as a tech-led selloff tied to Chinese AI developer DeepSeek sent major indices plunging.Billionaires whose fortunes are linked to artificial intelligence were the biggest losers: Huang saw his fortune fall $20.1 billion, a 20% drop, while Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison ’s $22.6 billion loss was larger in absolute terms, but represented just 12% of his fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Dell Inc.’s Michael Dell lost $13 billion, and Binance Holdings Ltd. co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao shaved $12.1 billion.Tech-sector titans as a group saw $94 billion of wealth evaporate — roughly 85% of the Bloomberg index’s total decline. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.1%, and the S&P 500 dropped 1.5%.Hangzhou-based DeepSeek has been developing AI models since 2023, but the company first came onto the radar of many Western investors this weekend as its free DeepSeek R1 chatbot app topped download charts worldwide. So many new users piled in that DeepSeek struggled to keep the app online, suffering outages and forcing it to restrict signups to users with Chinese phone numbers.DeepSeek’s dark-horse entry into the AI race, which it says cost just $5.6 million to develop, is a challenge to Silicon Valley’s narrative that massive capital spending is essential to developing the strongest models. That delivered a serious blow to billionaires whose fortunes are tied to the Western AI supply chain that’s been the equities market’s biggest driver over the past two years.Also Read | 'Sputnik moment': Chinese DeepSeek wipes off $1 trillion from US tech giants in a day Soaring valuations for so-called AI hyperscalers — including Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — have generated billions in wealth for their owners since OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in November 2022. These companies have for the most part operated on a similar playbook: Spend huge sums to develop and run AI systems by hoarding top-of-the-line semiconductors and the energy supplies needed to run them.Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced Friday that the company planned to spend $60 billion to $65 billion on projects related to AI this year, well above Wall Street estimates. Capital spending across all Big Tech firms is on pace to reach $200 billion in 2025, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report.Despite limited revenue to show for all their investment so far, markets have rewarded US tech stocks with record-high valuations, which have in turn generated historic wealth gains for their owners. Nvidia has stood out as the AI boom’s biggest single winner so far, with Huang’s net worth increasing almost eight-fold to $121 billion since the start of 2023 through Friday. Zuckerberg’s fortune soared 385% to $229 billion over the same period and Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos gained 133% to $254 billion.While Huang and Ellison suffered losses, other major tech billionaires’ fortunes escaped unscathed. Zuckerberg’s net worth ended the day up, gaining $4.3 billion as Meta rebounded from an early-session decline. Bezos’ wealth climbed by about $632 million.The fact that DeepSeek was able to develop a free model that potentially rivals or beats competitors including ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude at a fraction of the development cost led investors to question the logic behind Silicon Valley’s dependence on capital spending.A key reason why DeepSeek didn’t rely on big investment and top-of-the-line chips to develop its model is that Chinese firms have had limited access to the powerful GPUs, or graphics processing units, most Western companies rely on ever since the US government instituted strict export controls on the most advanced chips.In an interview with CNBC last week, Alexandr Wang, CEO of training data provider Scale AI, said that despite the export controls, DeepSeek and other Chinese developers likely have more GPUs than Silicon Valley is aware of.“The Chinese labs have more H100s than people think,” Wang said, referring to Nvidia’s top-of-the-line AI chip. “My understanding is that DeepSeek has about 50,000 H100s, which they can’t talk about, obviously, because it’s against the export controls that the US has in place.”",The world’s 500 richest people lost a combined $108 billion on Monday as a tech- led selloff tied to Chinese AI developer DeepSeek sent major indices plunging.

Poll Is DeepSeek's AI Technology Superior to Other Available AI Tools? No, It Still Has a Long Way to Go Yes, It’s a Game Changer

Why it matters

DeepSeek’s success challenges the prevailing belief that AI dominance depends on massive financial investments and cutting-edge technology. By developing its latest model using Nvidia’s less advanced H800 chips, DeepSeek bypassed US export restrictions and delivered an AI system that rivals offerings from companies like OpenAI and Google at a fraction of the cost.

This raises critical questions: Is the US strategy of pouring billions into AI infrastructure sustainable?

Is the US strategy of pouring billions into AI infrastructure sustainable? Can the multibillion-dollar valuations of US tech companies like Nvidia and Microsoft be justified in light of such efficient alternatives?

Are US sanctions on China’s access to advanced chips like Nvidia’s H100 truly effective?

The Nasdaq’s dramatic selloff underscores how vulnerable the market remains to shifts in the AI narrative. As DeepSeek demonstrates, innovation doesn’t always require the most expensive tools.

The geopolitical implications of DeepSeek ’s success are profound. For years, US policymakers have sought to curtail China’s technological ambitions through export controls and sanctions. However, DeepSeek’s rise suggests that these measures may be insufficient to halt China’s progress in AI. By developing competitive models with limited resources, China has signaled its ability to challenge US dominance in a field considered critical to future economic and strategic power.

’s success are profound. For years, US policymakers have sought to curtail China’s technological ambitions through export controls and sanctions. However, DeepSeek’s rise suggests that these measures may be insufficient to halt China’s progress in AI. By developing competitive models with limited resources, China has signaled its ability to challenge US dominance in a field considered critical to future economic and strategic power. Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, pointed out the political significance of DeepSeek’s timing. “The technology innovation is real, but the timing of the release is political in nature,” he said, comparing it to other high-profile Chinese tech launches that coincided with diplomatic tensions.

The big picture: The disruptor from China

DeepSeek’s rise has upended conventional wisdom about AI development. Founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a hedge fund manager, the Hangzhou-based startup leverages bespoke algorithms and open-source principles. The company developed its latest model, R1, for just $5.6 million—a stark contrast to the hundreds of millions that US firms like OpenAI spend to train comparable models.

DeepSeek’s innovative approach involved using reduced-capability Nvidia H800 chips to train its AI systems. These chips, designed for the Chinese market to comply with US export controls, were thought to be less capable than the H100 chips used by American firms. Despite this limitation, DeepSeek’s R1 model outperformed rivals, including OpenAI’s o1-mini, across several benchmarks.

Last month, DeepSeek drew significant attention in the AI industry by releasing a new AI model it claimed was comparable to offerings from US firms like OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. This model was also touted as more cost-efficient in its use of Nvidia chips to train on massive datasets. The chatbot became more accessible after launching on Apple and Google app stores earlier this year.

However, the real stir began with a follow-up research paper published last week — coinciding with President Donald Trump ’s inauguration anniversary. The paper detailed a new DeepSeek AI model called R1, which demonstrated advanced “reasoning” capabilities, such as rethinking approaches to math problems, and was significantly cheaper than OpenAI’s comparable model, o1.

The paper detailed a new DeepSeek AI model called R1, which demonstrated advanced “reasoning” capabilities, such as rethinking approaches to math problems, and was significantly cheaper than OpenAI’s comparable model, o1. “What their economics look like, I have no idea,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told AP. “But I think the price points freaked people out.”

This development calls into question the efficacy of US sanctions designed to curtail China’s progress in AI. If China can achieve such breakthroughs with limited access to advanced technology, the broader implications for US tech dominance and national security are significant.

Trump calls China’s AI DeepSeek breakthrough ‘a wakeup call’ — but ‘positive’ if true

What they are saying

Prominent voices across tech, politics, and finance have weighed in on the implications of DeepSeek’s success:

Marc Andreessen, US venture capitalist, likened the development to the Soviet Union’s 1957 launch of Sputnik: ""This is AI's ‘Sputnik moment,’ showcasing how China has narrowed the AI gap faster than expected.""

Donald Trump, US President, echoed the competitive urgency, stating, ""The release of DeepSeek’s AI should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win."" He praised the cost efficiency of DeepSeek’s approach, framing it as a challenge that US companies must rise to meet.

Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek CEO, expressed a vision of democratized AI: ""AI should be affordable and accessible to everyone.""

Deepseek's r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price. We will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI

Gone in a day: $1 trillion

The market reaction to DeepSeek’s announcement was swift and brutal. Nvidia shares plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value. Alphabet lost 4%, and Microsoft dropped 2.1%, highlighting the tech sector’s vulnerability to disruption. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 9.2%, its steepest drop since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The selloff also spilled into global markets: European chipmaker ASML saw a 7% drop.

In Japan, SoftBank, which has heavily invested in AI, tumbled 8.3%.

Energy firms like Constellation Energy, banking on AI-driven demand for power, suffered losses of over 20%.

Richard Hunter of Interactive Investor summed up the market’s anxiety: ""It will almost certainly put the cat among the pigeons as investors scramble to assess the potential damage it could have on a burgeoning industry.""

Between the lines

What’s next

A seismic shift in the global AI landscape rattled stock markets on Monday, as the Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a game-changing AI model. The company’s low-cost and high-performing technology sent shockwaves through Wall Street, erasing $1 trillion from the Nasdaq’s market value and sparking fears about the sustainability of the US-dominated AI boom.Nvidia, the US chipmaker at the heart of AI infrastructure, suffered the largest one-day market cap loss in history, shedding nearly $600 billion in value. The Nasdaq Composite fell 3.1%, with Google’s parent company Alphabet losing $100 billion and Microsoft dropping $7 billion. The development marks a pivotal moment in the race between the US and China for AI supremacy.DeepSeek’s success could ignite a price war in the AI market, forcing competitors to reassess their business models. OpenAI, which has heavily invested in costly infrastructure, may face pressure to lower prices—a move that could strain its finances further.Some analysts, however, remain skeptical about DeepSeek’s claims. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein noted, ""While DeepSeek’s pricing blows away the competition, the notion that they achieved this for $5.6 million seems overly optimistic. Hidden costs likely exist.""Nevertheless, DeepSeek’s open-source approach has earned praise for its potential to democratize AI access. Dr.Andrew Duncan of the UK’s Alan Turing Institute remarked, ""It demonstrates that you can do amazing things with relatively small models and resources.""The emergence of DeepSeek comes at a critical time for US tech giants, with companies like Apple and Microsoft set to report earnings this week. Investors will be watching closely for signs of how these firms plan to navigate a more competitive AI landscape.At the same time, the broader geopolitical implications are profound. DeepSeek’s rise highlights the diminishing returns of US export controls. If China can produce world-class AI models without access to advanced hardware, the US may need to rethink its approach to maintaining technological leadership.Trump has already signaled his administration’s intent to tighten restrictions further, calling for the elimination of loopholes in existing export controls. However, some experts, like Gregory Allen of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believe the timing of DeepSeek’s announcement may have been politically motivated to undermine US policies.(With inputs from agencies)","DeepSeek’s success challenges the prevailing belief that AI dominance depends on massive financial investments and cutting-edge technology.

DeepSeek’s sudden fame strains its systems and draws attacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/deepseeks-sudden-fame-strains-its-systems-and-draws-attacks/articleshow/117615910.cms,"Talk of an artificial-intelligence upstart in China behind a formidable ChatGPT rival had been building for days.At the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, some mentioned Hangzhou-based DeepSeek and its recently released R1 model as a prime reason for countries such as the US to be doubling down on AI advancements. On tech chat boards, engineers had begun comparing its programming performance to leading models from the likes of OpenAI and Microsoft Corp. Its product quietly rose through the ranks of top performers on a UC Berkeley-affiliated AI leaderboard.Then, within the past 36 hours, interest in the startup exploded. Silicon Valley heavyweights including investor Marc Andreessen and AI godfather and chief Meta Platforms Inc. scientist Yann LeCun began piling into the conversation, with Andreessen calling DeepSeek’s model “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs” he’s ever seen.By the end of the weekend, DeepSeek’s AI assistant had rocketed to the top of Apple Inc.’s iPhone download charts and ranked among the top downloads on Google’s Play Store, straining the startup’s systems so much that the service went down for more than an hour. The company was eventually forced to limit signups to those with mainland China telephone numbers — but claimed the move was the result of “large-scale malicious attacks” on its services.The fallout from the seemingly overnight surge in interest around DeepSeek was swift, and severe: The company’s AI model , which it claims to have developed at a fraction of the cost of rivals without meaningfully sacrificing performance, drove a nearly $1 trillion rout in US and European technology stocks as investors questioned the spending plans of some of America’s biggest companies. The share plunge in AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. alone wiped out a record $589 billion in stock-market value from the world’s largest company on Monday.Some stocks, including Nvidia, later erased some losses in after-hours trading.By Monday, it was clear the overwhelming interest in DeepSeek’s services was taking a toll on the company’s system. “Currently, only registration with a mainland China mobile phone number is supported,” the startup said on its status page. DeepSeek did not specify whether the signup curbs are temporary or how long they will last.It was the company’s longest major outage since it started reporting its status. Unlike some rivals, DeepSeek’s assistant shows its work and reasoning as it addresses a user’s written query or prompt. Reviews on Apple’s app store and on Alphabet Inc.’s Android Play Store praised that transparency.Founded by quant fund chief Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek’s open-sourced AI model is spurring a rethink of the billions of dollars that companies have been spending to stay ahead in the AI race.“While it remains to be seen if DeepSeek will prove to be a viable, cheaper alternative in the long term, initial worries are centered on whether US tech giants’ pricing power is being threatened and if their massive AI spending needs re-evaluation,” said Jun Rong Yeap of IG Asia.Like all other Chinese-made AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed politically sensitive in China. Unlike ChatGPT, DeepSeek deflects questions about Tiananmen Square, President Xi Jinping or the possibility of China invading Taiwan. That may prove jarring to international users, who may not have come into direct contact with Chinese chatbots earlier.The initial success provides a counterpoint to expectations that the most advanced AI will require increasing amounts of computing power and energy —- an assumption that has driven shares in Nvidia and its suppliers to all-time highs.The exact cost of development and energy consumption of DeepSeek are not fully documented, but the startup has presented figures that suggest its cost was only a fraction of OpenAI’s latest models. That a small and efficient AI model emerged from China, which has been subject to escalating US trade sanctions on advanced Nvidia chips, is also challenging the effectiveness of such measures.“The US is great at research and innovation and especially breakthrough, but China is better at engineering,” computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee said earlier this month at the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong. “In this day and age, when you have limited compute power and money, you learn how to build things very efficiently.”For its part, Nvidia — the biggest provider of chips used to train AI software — described DeepSeek’s new model as an “excellent AI advancement” that fully complies with the US government’s restrictions on technology exports. The startup’s work “illustrates how new models can be created” using a technique known as test time scaling, the company said.Nvidia’s statement appeared to dismiss some analysts’ and experts’ suspicions that the Chinese startup couldn’t have made the breakthrough it has claimed. The company also pointed out that inference, the work of actually running AI models and using it to process data and make predictions, nonetheless requires a lot of its products.“Inference requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking,” the company said.","Hangzhou-based DeepSeek and its recently released R1 model is a prime reason for countries such as the US to be doubling down on AI advancements.

NEW YORK: US chip-maker Nvidia led a rout in tech stocks Monday after the emergence of a low-cost Chinese generative AI model that could threaten American dominance in the fast-growing industry.The chatbot developed by DeepSeek, a startup based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, has apparently shown the ability to match the capacity of US AI pace-setters for a fraction of the investments made by American companies.Shares in Nvidia, whose semiconductors power the AI industry, fell nearly 17 percent on Wall Street, erasing nearly $600 billion of its market value.The tech-rich Nasdaq index finished down more than three percent.DeepSeek, whose chatbot became the top-rated free application on Apple's US App Store, said it spent only $5.6 million developing its model -- peanuts when compared with the billions US tech giants have poured into AI.US ""tech dominance is being challenged by China,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB.""The focus is now on whether China can do it better, quicker and more cost effectively than the US, and if they could win the AI race,"" she said.Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B.

Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

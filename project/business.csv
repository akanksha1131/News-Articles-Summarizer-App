Top stock market recommendations :Nifty gave a positive close after ending 10 consecutive sessions in red as the index was into an extreme oversold zone not seen in the past 5 years of trade. The index has gained over a percent for the first time in the last 4 weeks of trade. The index has taken support at its 61.8% retracement of its past 5 year rally. We maintain our neutral stance on the index due to this oversold structure and no confirmation on reversals yet on charts. Short covering opens up broadly only when Nifty closes above 22451.After an inside bar formation on Tuesday, the index has given a breakout above its previous day’s high as well as a close above the same confirms that this move is likely to extend further. The point to watch for reversal on this index is seen at 48600 on a closing basis. Bank Nifty as well has taken support at its 61.8% retracement of its past 5 year rally and holding on to this, is likely to open up higher targets while for now, a 500-700 point rally awaits to be unfolded above 48600 closing.Charts of INDIGO have just given a breakout of its symmetrical triangle pattern which was in place for the past 6 months on daily and weekly charts, a squeezed move from lower high and higher low formation has helped the price push out of this breakout zone. Another 6-8% up move in a similar direction could be seen as initial targets of this pattern.A 3-month falling trendline breakout was observed in Tuesday’s trading session with a flag formation on hourly and daily charts which could allow further thrust to Jindal Steel given the initial green flags seen on metal as a sector. Another 6-8% move in a similar direction appears to be unfolding on charts.In a scenario wherein stocks and indices are anywhere between 6 month to 12 month lows, this chart is popping out at a 6 month high instead. Early signs of capital flows to the scrip are visible given the price action sustaining against the broader market selloff. With repeated higher low formation on daily charts, this could act as a tailwind for another 9-12% up move in a similar direction northwards.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Indigo, Jindal Steel, and Medanta are the top buy calls for today.

‘False’ FASTag wallet toll deduction? Here’s what NHAI is doing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/false-fastag-wallet-toll-deduction-heres-what-nhai-is-doing/articleshow/118677800.cms,"FASTag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home.

‘False FASTag toll deduction ’: The National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) has taken strict action against incorrect FASTag wallet deductions, penalising toll collectors in approximately 250 instances.FASTag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home or haven't crossed toll plazas. Officials attribute this to toll operators' errors in vehicle number entry, particularly when FASTag becomes unreadable, or when individuals carry tags in their wallets.IHMCL , the highways authority's toll management body, now levies a Rs 1 lakh fine per violation in such cases. According to a TOI report , this substantial penalty has resulted in a 70% reduction in such incidents.Currently, IHMCL receives about 50 legitimate complaints monthly, compared to 30 crore FASTag transactions across national highway toll plazas.Users have reported false toll deductions on social media platforms and through formal complaints to IHMCL. ""Customers facing false deductions can file a complaint by calling 1033 or emailing falsededuction@ihmcl.com and each case is thoroughly investigated. And if the complaint of such deduction or incorrect manual transactions is established, chargebacks are issued to the customer immediately. Additionally, a Rs 1 lakh penalty is imposed on the toll operator responsible,"" said a senior IHMCL official.Also Read | Turnaround from importer to exporter!

The system facilitates automatic toll fee deductions from a connected prepaid account, which users can control via FASTag applications. This electronic tag, attached to the vehicle's windscreen, establishes communication with toll plaza scanning equipment.NHAI implemented FASTag, making it compulsory for all vehicles. This electronic toll collection system has transformed toll payments across India by significantly reducing queue times, decreasing fuel usage, and minimising person-to-person contact at toll booths.","FASTag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home or haven't crossed toll plazas.

RBI takes note! How overseas students are being used by wealthy parents to stash money abroad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-takes-note-how-overseas-students-are-being-used-by-wealthy-parents-to-stash-money-abroad/articleshow/118701594.cms,"RBI's 2003 regulation granted 'non-resident Indian' (NRI) status to overseas students. (AI image)

Course correction

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is reportedly examining the utilisation of a two-decade-old foreign exchange regulation that was initially established to assist Indian students studying abroad. Students have been quietly facilitating international money transfers for years, a practice that is now gaining attention.The central bank's 2003 regulation granted 'non-resident Indian' (NRI) status to overseas students. This measure was primarily implemented to support students who sought employment abroad to fund their education. Previously, these students were classified as 'residents'. The change aimed to protect working students from inadvertently violating the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) of 2000, which required residents to repatriate their foreign earnings.According to an ET report, affluent Indian families realised that their children's NRI status could serve as an avenue for substantial international fund transfers, an option not available to 'resident' parents under existing regulations.""Once a person is treated as a non-resident under FEMA, he is entitled to freely repatriate all current income in India and all capital sums up to $1 million every financial year from his NRO bank account... compared to a resident who can remit only $250,000. If RBI is considering reviewing this circular, it may be worthwhile for the regulator to draw a distinction for those students who go for long-duration courses, say, more than 4 years. Such persons could continue to be classified as non-residents under FEMA,"" Anup P. Shah, partner of the CA firm Pravin P. Shah & Company, was quoted as saying.Various tax and FEMA experts who spoke with the financial daily indicated that RBI might review the circular to establish clear guidelines between legitimate students with overseas part-time employment and those seeking NRI status solely for fund transfers abroad.Also Read | Turnaround from importer to exporter! India now shipping Apple product components to China & Vietnam Moin Ladha, partner at Khaitan & Co, explains, ""The primary criteria for determining residency is an individual's intention to leave India for an uncertain period."" He notes the distinction between long-term university students and those attending brief courses. ""The regulators or the government may be seeking to clarify this distinction to prevent the misuse of enhanced financial limits available to NRIs by students enrolling in short-term programs without the intention or ability to secure employment or remain abroad.""Some observers suggest that substantial fund transfers might have been integral to the strategy of affluent families choosing overseas relocation and foreign citizenship. Current regulations permit previously transferred or received funds to remain abroad, even if the student later returns to establish residency in India.Also Read | Taxpayers take note! Crack down against 40,000 TDS/TCS defaulters planned by Income Tax department Rajesh P. Shah, partner at Jayantilal Thakkar & Company, a firm specialising in tax and FEMA matters, states, ""The 2003 circular on students becoming NRIs was issued a year RBI allowed LRS. Now after 22 years, it is crystal clear that RBI considers such students as NRIs. However, students should keep in mind the intention of RBI behind the circular rather than using it for the ultimate benefit of their families. RBI may intervene to restrict use of such circular if they deem fit.""",RBI's 2003 regulation granted 'non-resident Indian' (NRI) status to overseas students.

How will Elon Musk-led DOGE’s slashing of federal spending impact Indian IT companies?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-will-elon-musk-led-doges-slashing-of-federal-spending-impact-indian-it-companies/articleshow/118727017.cms,"Analysts suggest that DOGE's jurisdiction primarily covers federal contracts, whilst Indian IT firms predominantly work with state and local governments.

The cancellation of federal contracts by the US Department of Government Efficiency 's ( DOGE ), under Elon Musk 's leadership, might affect consulting-focused technology firms working on discretionary US government projects. However, Indian IT companies are expected to face minimal impact from these changes.According to the Everest Group, the Indian IT services sector receives a small fraction of annual US federal expenditure, comprising less than 2% of its yearly revenue. For the Indian IT industry, valued at over $280 billion, the exposure to US federal contracts remains below $6 billion, says an ET report.Everest Group vice president Prashant Shukla noted, ""In cases where Indian service providers have direct exposure to federal contracts, protective contractual clauses might require the US government to establish a special case for termination, such as termination for cause.""Also Read | ‘You are better off…’: Zerodha's Nithin Kamath shares SIP mantra amidst stock market crash doom and gloom Analysts suggest that DOGE's jurisdiction primarily covers federal contracts, whilst Indian IT firms predominantly work with state and local governments, thus remaining largely unaffected by DOGE's decisions.HFS Research data indicates that the US federal government allocates approximately $60 billion annually for consulting services.Despite Wipro and US-based Cognizant maintaining substantial consulting operations, with the latter's workforce primarily based in India, their exposure to US federal contracts remains limited. Analysts anticipate any impact on these companies to be negligible.The US federal budget for 2025 has allocated $75 billion towards IT implementation at civilian agencies to enhance government service delivery. The President's budget includes an additional $75 million for the technology modernisation fund, introducing an innovative funding approach to government IT utilisation.Despite short-term uncertainties, Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at tech growth advisory firm Catalincs, anticipates that DOGE's initiatives will stimulate significant federal government technology expenditure, benefiting global technology organisations.Companies with Indian heritage in IT services that have established robust public services operations stand to gain, along with organisations that have developed local talent and centres in the US through various means, according to Ramamoorthy. He additionally identifies prospects for small and medium-sized IT service providers.Also Read | Tesla India entry: Why Donald Trump has said it would be ‘very unfair’ for Elon Musk’s Tesla to set up a factory in India The establishment of a centralised technological framework within DOGE for monitoring spending impact, redistributing budget for infrastructure upgrades, system modernisation, utilising analytics and AI for operational enhancement, whilst building cyber resilience will enhance efficiency and innovation, he noted. This development could create opportunities for Indian IT sector.Phil Fersht, CEO and chief analyst at HFS, indicated that alongside the Big 4 consultancies - KPMG, PwC, EY and Deloitte - DOGE's initiatives might adversely affect Accenture Federal Services, IBM, Booz Allen, General Dynamics and others.""Most of this work encompasses overall IT strategy and transformation infrastructure development, integration, data management, cloud migration and cybersecurity,"" Fersht stated, noting that Indian outsourcing companies' limited exposure might result in reduced impact.","The Indian IT services sector receives a small fraction of annual US federal expenditure, comprising less than 2% of its yearly revenue.

Stock market crash : The Indian stock market has experienced a consistent decline since late September, eliminating all gains achieved by benchmark indices over the past year. The Nifty 50 and Sensex have decreased by 1.4% and 1.2% respectively in yearly returns, with Nifty's Smallcap 250 showing the steepest decline at 7.7%.

""This is due to first-time investors who are seeing their first correction and exiting , along with large clients like treasuries and HNIs (high networth individuals) unwilling to bet big in the current weak scenario.""According to Raichura, short-term market increases might trigger additional selling, with substantial recovery likely to begin in large-caps before extending to mid- and small-caps.

Liquidity boost: RBI to pump in Rs 1.9 lakh crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/liquidity-boost-rbi-to-pump-in-rs-1-9-lakh-crore/articleshow/118746405.cms,"Reserve Bank of India

MUMBAI: RBI is set to infuse nearly Rs 1.9 lakh crore into the banking system to address liquidity constraints, which have been exacerbated by the central bank's foreign exchange market operations and tax outflows. The move, seen as part of RBI measures to support growth, comes on the back of the central bank easing loans for microfinance and finance companies.As part of these liquidity efforts, RBI will conduct open market operations to purchase govt bonds worth Rs 1 lakh crore, with two separate auctions of Rs 50,000 crore each scheduled for March 12 and March 18. Additionally, RBI will conduct a buy/sell swap auction for $10 billion, which will have a tenor of 36 months, on March 24. The swap (where RBI buys dollars with an agreement to reverse the sale at predetermined price after three years) will result in a Rs 87,000-crore liquidity infusion.These liquidity measures come ahead of a significant outflow from the markets due to advance tax payments. ""The ides of March (March 15) are when the money markets see the worst liquidity crunch due to advance tax outflows,"" said a bond dealer. The infusion of liquidity is expected to ease some of the pressures on the banking system.RBI has assured that it will continue to monitor evolving liquidity and market conditions and take necessary measures to ensure orderly liquidity conditions. RBI reduced interest rates by 25 basis points on Feb 6, marking its first rate cut in five years, as part of ongoing efforts to enhance liquidity in the bond markets.On Feb 28, RBI had conducted a dollar/rupee swap worth $10 billion to inject long-term liquidity into the system, which attracted robust demand.As of March 4, Indian banks' liquidity deficit stood at Rs 20,420 crore, the lowest level since Dec 15.Lower rates and easier liquidity will help in bank credit growth which has slowed down to 11.2% in Dec. India's economy grew by 6.2% in the Dec quarter, driven by increased govt and consumer spending. Since mid-Jan, the central bank has infused over Rs 4.5 lakh crore into the system, including about Rs 1.4 lakh crore in bond purchases, around Rs 1.3 lakh crore via foreign exchange swaps, and Rs 1.8 lakh crore through early April-maturity repo auctions. The measures are expected to have a positive impact on the bond market and the rupee, with forward premiums likely to fall.",RBI is set to infuse nearly Rs 1.9 lakh crore into the banking system to address liquidity constraints.

At 9:18 AM, BSE Sensex was trading at 74,068.32, up 338 points or 0.46%. Nifty50 was at 22,447.55, up 110 points or 0.49%.The Nifty index showed significant recovery, ending its 10-day downward trend on Wednesday. This upturn was attributed to positive performance in Asian markets and strategic buying at reduced prices in Indian exchanges. Market experts indicate that sustained recovery will depend on developments regarding US tariff policies and continued interest in domestic equities.Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services says, “We are in a highly uncertain and volatile situation for global trade, global economy and markets.

MUMBAI: Volumes in the cash and the derivatives segments of the market have dropped by up to 25% during the Jan-Feb months compared to last year, thanks mainly to a bad market and Sebi's stricter regulations for the derivatives segment that came into force last November. The hike in contract sizes in the F&O segment has affected daily volumes for retail traders , while for institutional traders the sharp hike in expiry day margins weighed, an analysis by Kotak Institutional Equities noted.Although Sebi is currently in the process of consultation for putting in another set of rules for derivatives trading , those are unlikely to have much impact on trading volumes , the report said.""With a large part of retail-focused F&O regulations now in play, we have seen about a 20% drop in retail premium turnover and active retail traders,"" the report said. ""Proprietary/ institutional trading has seen a slightly higher drop in premium (about 25%), with uncertainty from the potential introduction of new position limit rules (in consultation at this stage). While more immediate measures to tighten the F&O markets seem unlikely, it is unclear deliveries on what metrics are crucial to settle this issue,"" it said.""While volume decline is already evident, any second-order impacts will be visible over the next 6-12 months. Another round of tightening seems a low-probability scenario for now,"" it said.The report also pointed out that the cash market activity had also seen a lull, with declines across metrics such as retail volume (about 25%), active traders (about 20%) and margin loans (about 15%).Average daily cash volume in the retail segment has dropped to about Rs 30,000 crore from the peak of about Rs 50,000 crore, even as these levels are still higher than previous years.

Danish co ECCO bets on premium shoes demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/danish-co-ecco-bets-on-premium-shoes-demand/articleshow/118746604.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Danish family-run footwear company ECCO seems to have found a sweet spot in India, leveraging on the rising demand for premium sneakers and the growing popularity of golf in the country.Labelled as an aspirational golf footwear brand globally, the euro 1.6 billion company plans to focus on the top 2.5% of the population, avoiding the mass-market sneakers, Patrick Iversen, regional director of South East Asia and Pacific, ECCO told TOI in an interview.The growing popularity of sneakers has been fueled by Gen-Z's influence and the post-Covid shift to casual wear globally and in India, featuring a wide spectrum from luxury designer collaborations to premium and affordable options.""As a family-owned company, we take a long-term view when it comes to India. While we are keen to establish a strong presence here, we will evaluate our progress over a number of years rather than taking a short-term perspective. Currently we have six stores, but most of them have only recently opened. Our goal is to expand to 25 stores by the end of next year. It takes time to understand consumer sentiment, and we want to invest heavily in the brand through marketing, and other initiatives,'' Iversen said.Though ECCO, owned by the Toosbuy family, entered India in 2019, its expansion was initially stymied by the Covid pandemic. However, witnessing a significant 5x growth in consumer demand, the company is now aggressively planning to expand its retail and online presence, reinforcing its positioning as a leading premium footwear brand (priced around Rs 25,000).ECCO aims to have 25 stores by the end of next year. ""Golf is a small but a growing market with 150,000 registered golfers. We are the number 1 premium brand. We believe also there is a sweet spot in the quality footwear market that is untapped..We do not want to really stick ourselves in the sneakers or value brands' game,"" he added.Other major golf shoe brands in India include FootJoy, TaylorMade and ColeHaan.ECCO's strategy aims to tap into metro and tier 1 cities coupled with its own D2C channel, and other e-commerce platforms. Around 35% of sales come from tier 2 and 3 cities.It sells in over 80 markets globally, with its largest markets being China, Russia, and the US. The golf footwear segment contributes a quarter of its worldwide sales.","Danish family-run footwear company ECCO seems to have found a sweet spot in India.

PSU shareholders to earn record dividends,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/psu-shareholders-to-earn-record-dividends/articleshow/118746148.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Central public sector undertakings (PSUs) are on course to pay record dividends of Rs 1.3-1.4 lakh crore during the current financial year, which will not just help govt end the fiscal with a better than budgeted mop-up but will come as a boon for lakhs of retail investors in these stocks.Dividends will come on the back of profits of these companies projected to top the Rs 3.5 lakh crore mark for the first time, according to official estimates, which will be at least 10% higher than last year's level.The department for investment and public asset management (DIPAM) and the department of public enterprises (DPE) have decided to enforce govt guidelines, which mandate that at least 30% of the profits or 4% of the net worth should be shared in the form of dividends, leaving enough money for the PSUs to invest in capex, which is another focus area for the Centre.""We want public enterprises to act as a role model in the stock market and will urge the private sector to do the same and declare fair dividends so that confidence of common citizens and ordinary investors can be restored in the stock market,"" said Arunish Chawla, secretary, DIPAM, who is also in-charge of DPE. Of the 266 PSUs, 66 are currently listed on stock exchanges.A higher dividend payout will also help the Centre earn around Rs 10,000 crore more than the revised estimate for the current financial year and can help improve the overall fiscal deficit, which is pegged at 4.8% of GDP.In the budget, govt has budgeted for dividend receipts of a little under Rs 2.9 lakh crore, which includes those from the Reserve Bank of India and public sector banks and insurance companies.Govt estimates suggest that capex by central PSUs could be of the order of Rs 3.6 lakh crore in the current fiscal year, compared with Rs 3.5 lakh crore last year. It is projected to grow almost 20% to Rs 4.3 lakh crore in 2025-26, augmenting the Centre's efforts to invest more in asset creation and generate demand for inputs such as steel and cement, while also creating jobs.","Dividends will come on the back of profits of these companies projected to top the Rs 3.5 lakh crore mark for the first time.

Industry willing to accept tariff reductions with US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/industry-willing-to-accept-tariff-reductions-with-us/articleshow/118746140.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: As India and the US get down to working out the contours of the proposed bilateral trade agreement, amid Donald Trump's tariff threat, domestic industry is willing to accept tariff cuts on items of its interest, while suggesting that government pursue a similar action by American authorities for products of interest to them.Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal is in the US to meet commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and US trade representative Jamieson Greer and discuss how the deal can be structured, within the Fall (Sept-Oct) deadline set by PM Narendra Modi and Trump last month.With Trump repeatedly naming India among countries with high tariffs, domestic players realise that there must be some give-and-take under the bilateral deal, although each will seek to protect its turf. Govt's strategy will be to lower duties in some areas in return for getting concessions in areas of interest to it, such as textiles or leather.During its discussions with govt, apparel sector has identified over 50 items of interest to India, and has suggested that tariffs could be lowered, including those that are covered by PLI, and even eliminate tariffs for some. ""Govt can consider bringing down the applicable customs duty on major apparel products vis-a-vis the US... Since apparel imports into India from the US are negligible, govt may also consider offering zero-for-zero for all apparel products of our strategic interest,"" said Mithileshwar Thakur, secretary general, AEPC. Zero for zero means eliminating levies in return for a similar move by the trading partner.Similarly, the engineering goods sector - the largest segment of country's export basket - has identified 33 items where Indian exporters ship goods worth over $1 million, including products like stainless steel angle bars and round bars, where it wants concessions. With the US raising levies on steel and steel products to 25%, it is not worried about reciprocal tariffs since India levies 7.5-15% duty. ""We don't see too much import coming, the biggest item of import is scrap, which is at zero duty,"" said Pankaj Chadha, chairman EEPC India.From the gems and jewellery sector , the proposals include slashing import duties on polished and lab-grown diamonds from 5% to 2.5%, reducing gold, silver, and platinum jewellery tariffs from 20% to 17%, and cutting duties on precious metals like gold bars from 5% to 4%.""This policy could necessitate adjustments to maintain India's dominance in the US market, where we hold substantial shares in cut and polished diamonds (45%), gold jewellery (24.6%), and worked lab-grown stones (92%),"" said Kirit Bhansali, chairman of the Gems & Jewelery Export Promotion Council, while arguing that reciprocal tariffs could result in orders moving to competing countries, causing job loss.While there may be pressure on the auto components sector, given the high level of protection in India, govt can make a trade off with automobiles, amid the clamour for lower duties from Trump and his close aide Elon Musk, who runs Tesla. The tricky area will be farm, poultry and dairy products, including items like chicken legs and shrimps.","Domestic industry is willing to accept tariff cuts on items of its interest.

US President Donald Trump spoke about his plans for the new immigration initiative called 'Gold Card', aimed at attracting wealthy, job-creating individuals to the United States.""We will now bring in brilliant, hardworking, job-creating people,"" Trump said during his address to Congress, reiterating that the new programme would offer a pathway to US citizenship for a $5 million fee.Also read: Donald Trump delivers longest-ever presidential speech to US Congress, beats Bill Clinton ""With that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, which goes on sale very, very soon for $5 million.

They won't have to pay tax from where they came, the money that they've made. But they have to pay tax, create jobs,"" the US President said.""We will now bring in brilliant, hardworking, job creating people.

Trump has claimed that the new initiative would provide a more effective and lucrative alternative.""They'll be wealthy and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it's going to be extremely successful,"" he had said.Trump argued that many such individuals were forced to return to their home countries, where they went on to build successful businesses. ""They return to India or their home country, start businesses, and become billionaires, employing thousands,"" he said. The Gold Card, he added, would allow companies to retain top talent by purchasing the card as part of their recruitment strategy. ""I want to be able to have that person stay in the country. These companies can go and buy a Gold Card, and they can use it as a matter of recruitment.""The Gold Card proposal echoes similar 'golden visa' schemes in countries like Canada, New Zealand, and Malta, where wealthy investors can obtain residency or citizenship by making significant financial contributions.",US President Donald Trump spoke about his plans for the new immigration initiative called 'Gold Card' The new programme would offer a pathway to US citizenship for a $5 million fee.

""It was just a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It is not body shaming. I always believe a sportsperson has to be fit. So I felt he's a bit overweight and I just tweeted on that,"" she told media.In an attempt to justify her statement, she compared Rohit Sharma to past Indian captains like MS Dhoni, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Kapil Dev, and Virat Kohli.

The commerce ministry stated these tariffs will take effect on 10 March, following President Donald Trump’s decision to increase tariffs on Chinese imports to 20%. The new measures apply a 15% tariff on US-grown chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton, while soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruit, vegetables, and dairy products will face an additional 10% duty.Additionally, Beijing has placed ten more US firms on its unreliable entity list, barring them from engaging in China-related trade and investment. The companies affected include Teledyne Brown Engineering, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Cubic Corporation, and ACT1 Federal. Senior executives from these firms will also be banned from entering China, and their work permits and residency privileges will be revoked. China’s Commerce Ministry cited arms sales to Taiwan as the reason for these measures.Last month, China had added PVH Group and Illumina to the same list, and it has now expanded restrictions further by adding 15 more US firms to its export control list.

‘An act of war’: Warren Buffett on Trump tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/an-act-of-war-warren-buffett-on-trump-tariffs/articleshow/118695693.cms,"Market reaction and economic concerns

Trump’s justification

Buffett’s market moves and long-term outlook

President Donald Trump ’s latest round of tariffs on major US trading partners has sparked concerns about inflation and economic disruption , with legendary investor Warren Buffett weighing in on the potential fallout.In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Buffett called tariffs “an act of war, to some degree,” drawing from decades of experience in the global economy. The billionaire investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway warned that tariffs function as a tax on goods, ultimately leading to higher prices for consumers.“The Tooth Fairy doesn’t pay ‘em!” Buffett quipped during the interview, emphasizing that the financial burden of tariffs will fall on consumers.Buffett’s remarks come as Trump moves forward with imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, effective Tuesday. The administration has also announced an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20%, a move that is likely to escalate tensions with Beijing. In response, China has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs, raising concerns of a renewed trade war .Economists widely agree that tariffs disrupt international trade and lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers. The Trump administration has presented tariffs as a tool to pressure foreign governments and boost domestic manufacturing, but critics warn that such policies could backfire, especially given the deeply integrated supply chains across North America.Trump’s tariff announcement sent financial markets into turmoil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 649 points (1.48%), while the S&P 500 dropped 1.76% and the Nasdaq fell 2.64%. Automaker stocks took a significant hit, with General Motors declining 4% and Ford down 1.7% due to their manufacturing dependencies in Mexico.The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar also declined in response to the news, while officials in both countries signaled that they were preparing countermeasures. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly criticized Trump’s move, calling it “unpredictable and chaotic.”Trump defended the tariffs at a White House event, arguing that they would encourage companies to move production to the U.S. “They’re going to have to have a tariff. So what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs,” he said.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick dismissed Buffett’s concerns, calling them “silly” in an interview on CNN’s The Situation Room. Lutnick went further, suggesting that tariffs could replace the need for the Internal Revenue Service, falsely claiming that the IRS was created when the US entered World War I. In reality, the IRS was established in 1862 during the Civil War, and the modern federal income tax was introduced in 1913.Despite the administration’s claims, experts argue that shifting government revenue away from income taxes to tariffs would be impractical, given the complexity and scale of the modern US economy.Buffett has historically been critical of tariffs, calling Trump’s past trade policies “a very bad idea.” His recent actions in the financial markets suggest caution about the economic outlook. Over the past year, Berkshire Hathaway has significantly increased its cash reserves, reaching a record $334.2 billion in the fourth quarter while selling off shares of major companies like Apple and Bank of America.Although Buffett refrained from directly commenting on the economy in his CBS interview, he described it as “the most interesting subject in the world.”Berkshire Hathaway’s stock has reached record highs, with both Class A and Class B shares surging. However, Buffett’s conservative investment approach has raised speculation that he is preparing for economic uncertainty.(With inputs from agencies)","Warren Buffett calls tariffs “an act of war, to some degree,” drawing from decades of experience in the global economy.

The global picture

What’s next

US stocks fell sharply on Monday, wiping out much of their gains since President Donald Trump ’s election, after he announced that tariffs on Canada and Mexico would take effect within hours.The S&P 500 dropped 1.8% following Trump's statement that there was ""no room left"" for negotiations to lower the tariffs, which will begin Tuesday. The move dashed Wall Street 's hopes for a softer trade policy.Monday’s losses cut the S&P 500’s post-Election Day gains to just over 1%, down from a peak of more than 6%. The market had rallied on hopes that Trump’s policies would strengthen the economy, but recent trade tensions and economic data have raised fears of a slowdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 649 points, or 1.5%, while the Nasdaq composite slumped 2.6%.The market decline came amid broader concerns about US economic growth. A report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday showed that manufacturing activity remained in expansion but at a slower pace than economists expected. More concerningly, manufacturers saw a contraction in new orders, while prices rose amid discussions over who will bear the cost of Trump’s tariffs.Timothy Fiore, chair of ISM’s manufacturing survey committee, noted, “Demand eased, production stabilized, and destaffing continued as panelists’ companies experience the first operational shock of the new administration’s tariff policy.”Wall Street had anticipated that Trump might use the tariffs as leverage for negotiations rather than enforcing them. However, the decision to proceed unsettled investors already wary of economic uncertainties.“Markets were looking for another 11th-hour deal to further delay tariffs, but aren’t going to get one this time,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. “The next phase is to endure them. Markets have to price that reality, and those numbers are painted red.”James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management, echoed the concerns: “It’s just more of a continuation of a string of bad economic news that tends to put a little bit of a dampener on the optimism we saw from fourth-quarter earnings.”Certain sectors and stocks were hit particularly hard. Nvidia fell 8.8%, and Tesla slipped 2.8%. Retail giant Kroger dropped 3% after its Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an internal investigation into his personal conduct.Even stocks connected to cryptocurrency took a hit. MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy, slid 1.8%, while Coinbase dropped 4.6% despite Trump’s weekend announcement that his administration was moving forward with a crypto strategic reserve.The effects of Trump’s trade policies are being felt worldwide. In China, manufacturers reported an increase in orders in February as buyers rushed to secure goods ahead of higher US tariffs. Trump’s 10% tariff on Chinese imports is set to rise to 20% on Tuesday, and the administration has also ended the “de minimis” loophole that exempted imports worth less than $800 from tariffs.European markets, in contrast, performed better. Germany’s DAX surged 2.6%, and France’s CAC 40 rose 1.1% following a report that showed inflation was easing in February. This bolstered expectations that the European Central Bank may cut interest rates later this week. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, bubble tea chain Mixue Bingcheng soared 43% in its market debut, boosting the Hang Seng index by 0.3%.Investors will be closely watching upcoming economic reports and Federal Reserve signals. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.16% from 4.24% before the manufacturing report’s release, reflecting concerns about a slowing economy. Typically, falling Treasury yields can boost stocks, but this time the decline is driven by fears of a broader economic downturn.With inflation worries still present, the Federal Reserve may have limited room to cut interest rates to stimulate growth. Market expectations currently point to at least two 25-basis-point rate cuts by the end of the year, but economic conditions could force a reassessment of that outlook.(With inputs from agencies)","The S&P 500 dropped 1.8% following Trump's statement that there was ""no room left"" for negotiations to lower the tariffs, which will begin Tuesday.

The US treasury department announced Sunday that it will no longer enforce the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) and its associated Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirements.The decision effectively suspends penalties for US citizens and domestic companies, shifting enforcement efforts toward foreign businesses.The move was welcomed by US President Donald Trump. He celebrated the decision on Truth Social, calling the BOI rule ""outrageous and invasive.""He wrote, ""Exciting news!

This Biden rule has been an absolute disaster for small businesses nationwide. Furthermore, treasury is now finalising an emergency regulation to formally suspend this rule for American businesses. The economic menace of BOI reporting will soon be no more.""The BOI rule, introduced under the CTA, required businesses to disclose details about their owners to the treasury’s financial crimes enforcement network (FinCEN) to curb money laundering and financial crimes.However, according to Irish Star, the enforcement of these requirements had already faced multiple delays due to legal challenges.As per Fox Business, treasury secretary Scott Bessent supported Trump’s stance, calling the decision ""a victory for common sense.""He added, ""Today’s action is part of President Trump’s bold agenda to unleash American prosperity by reining in burdensome regulations, in particular for small businesses that are the backbone of the American economy.""The treasury department also confirmed on X that “penalties or fines associated with BOI will not be enforced,” and clarified that the agency will issue a new proposed rule to limit the reporting requirement to foreign companies only.The CTA, which was signed into law in January 2021, was initially set to take effect in January 2024 but repeated federal court rulings delayed its implementation. The law aimed to increase financial transparency by making it harder for criminals to use shell companies for illicit activities such as money laundering and drug trafficking.Trump’s latest policy shift aligns with his broader economic agenda, which includes regulatory rollbacks and spending cuts ranging from $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion, according to Fox Business.","The US treasury department announced Sunday that it will no longer enforce the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) and its associated Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirements.

Trump's crypto play: A game changer or just a market jolt?

Unanswered questions: How will the crypto reserve work?

US President Donald Trump shook up the cryptocurrency world on Sunday, announcing that XRP (Ripple), SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano) would be included in a newly formed US Crypto Strategic Reserve . The move sent all three assets surging between 10% and 35% in market trading, reported Reuters.Trump revealed the decision in a social media post, tying it to his January executive order on digital assets. “I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World,” he declared, adding that his directive instructed the Presidential Working Group to move forward with the reserve plan.The announcement marks a sharp policy shift from the Biden administration, which had cracked down on the crypto industry over concerns about fraud and money laundering. Trump's 2024 campaign, in contrast, won significant backing from crypto executives, and his latest move signals that he intends to deliver on his pro-crypto promises.While the news initially sparked a rally, broader cryptocurrency markets have struggled in recent weeks, with many digital assets erasing their post-election gains. Analysts believe a more sustained market boost will require either interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve or a clearer regulatory framework from the Trump administration.Despite the excitement, details about the crypto reserve remain unclear. Some experts speculate it could be funded through the US Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, which is traditionally used to manage foreign currencies. Others suggest it might involve cryptocurrencies seized in law enforcement actions.Legal scholars are divided on whether the reserve could be established without congressional approval. Meanwhile, Trump’s inner circle is pressing ahead—his family has even launched its own cryptocurrency, and the first-ever White House Crypto Summit is set for Friday.With the administration doubling down on its pro-crypto stance, all eyes are now on Washington to see whether Trump’s bold move is the start of a new financial era or just another short-lived market shake-up.","US President Donald Trump announced Sunday that XRP (Ripple), SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano) would be included in a newly formed US Crypto Strategic Reserve.

"Tesla sets sights on Waymo, Uber in California ride-hail bid",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-sets-sights-on-waymo-uber-in-california-ride-hail-bid/articleshow/118656189.cms,"Tesla

Different business models

Tesla Inc. is seeking approval to offer ride-hailing services in California, a key step by Elon Musk’s company to begin carrying paying customers while its traditional car-selling business falters.The electric vehicle manufacturer applied late last year for what’s known as a transportation charter-party carrier permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, according to documents viewed by Bloomberg. That classification means Tesla would own and control the fleet of vehicles.The previously unreported application suggests Tesla is working to launch a promised ride-hailing business in the near term, opening a new revenue stream and putting it in competition with the likes of Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc. and Waymo. Musk has said Tesla would roll out driverless ride-hailing in Austin in June and aimed to offer it in California by the end of the year, without offering specific details.Shares of Uber briefly turned negative on the news and were trading up less than 1% as of 12.57 p.m. in New York. Lyft also pared gains. Tesla was little changed.Musk has made a big bet on autonomous driving , robotics and artificial intelligence as the primary business of selling EVs struggles. Tesla recently posted its first annual sales decline in over a decade, and the first quarter shows signs of sluggishness in key markets such as the US and Europe.In its communications with California officials, Tesla discussed driver’s license information and drug-testing coordination, suggesting the company intends to use human drivers, at least initially. Tesla is applying for the same type of permit used by Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s robotaxi business. While Tesla has approval to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in California, it doesn’t have, nor has applied for, a driverless testing or deployment permit from the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, according to a spokesperson.It wasn’t immediately clear whether Tesla would obtain the California Public Utilities Commission permit or when the service might start. A spokesperson said in an emailed statement that Tesla’s application “is pending and not yet public.”Casey Blaine, Tesla’s senior regulatory counsel, didn’t respond to requests from Bloomberg for comment. Several other Tesla employees who are involved in the effort also didn’t respond to inquiries.A ride-hailing business with human drivers could pave the way for Tesla to introduce robotaxi service in California, where Waymo already operates a driverless fleet in San Francisco.There are different permitting requirements and operating rules for each business model — Uber and Lyft allow drivers to use their personal vehicles, unlike Waymo — and the state’s stricter demands on autonomous vehicles have tripped up some companies. Cruise had its license suspended in California after an incident that injured a pedestrian, and parent General Motors Co. later folded the operations while abandoning the robotaxi market.Musk has talked for years about operating a Tesla fleet without human drivers. Tesla does not currently have a fully autonomous vehicle on the market, but it offers driver-assistance systems that control some functions while an alert human remains behind the wheel.Tesla unveiled a prototype in October of its forthcoming driverless Cybercab. Musk has said the company will roll out its ride-hailing service initially using existing vehicle models, which would include the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV.Musk recently addressed ride-hailing preparations, saying that there was “a bunch of work that needs to be done to make sure the whole thing works efficiently,” including ensuring that the payment system and app functionality operate as intended.Tesla’s path to launching robotaxi service is clearer in Texas, where autonomous driving is regulated much like any other vehicle. Its vehicles will be required to have cameras and be able to follow traffic laws and have insurance.The company will also need a ride-share license with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. As of early February, the company had not had communication with the department, according to a records request. Tesla is also not currently listed as a ride-share licensee on the department’s website.Uber is preparing to launch autonomous rides with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta this year.

Bitcoin slides from all-time high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bitcoin-slides-from-all-time-high/articleshow/118655668.cms,"Trump trade woes

A week-long rout in Bitcoin deepened amid the recent broader retreat from risky assets in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and crypto sector turmoil, marking a dramatic reality check for one of the most popular Trump trades.The original cryptocurrency tumbled as much as 7.2% to $78,226 at one point Friday, bringing its decline from the all-time high reached less than six weeks ago to 28%. Bitcoin later pared the loss, and ended up trading little changed on the day. Bitcoin fell around 18% in February, the biggest monthly drop since June 2022.“Some large players just said at the end of the day, ‘you know what, I’m just going to throw in the towel,” said Zaheer Ebtikar, co-founder of crypto fund Split Capital. “I think that’s what we saw this past week. There was definitely a lot of selling more than usual, so it’s hard to pinpoint one specific exchange or place.”This week’s drop in Bitcoin has taken it to technical levels that many traders watch for signs that the selloff may have gone too far, inspiring dip buyers to step in and at least pause the declines. Bitcoin has fallen below its 200-day moving average, a closely watched indicator of the long-term trend, for the first time since October. Its 14-day relative strength index, a gauge of price momentum, this week fell below a level indicating the asset is considered oversold for the first time since September.Trump said Thursday that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would come into force from March 4, undermining hopes he might reverse course after a previous delay. He also said Chinese imports would face a further 10% levy, prompting officials in Beijing to promise “all necessary measures” in response.The focus on trade tensions had led to a broad risk-off decline across markets on Friday, pushing down almost all Asian stock markets and fueling declines in Europe. But cryptocurrencies — which are deeply exposed to shifts in risk appetite — were among the worst hit.The selloff underscores a swift change of fortunes for what was previously one of the most popular Trump trades in global markets: buying Bitcoin on the expectation that the president’s crypto-friendly approach would lead to a broad rally.That worked for a while. Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $109,241 on Jan. 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. But cryptocurrencies have recently come under pressure amid worries that Trump’s pugilistic approach to global trade could lead to broad pain.“Given the macro environment, it’s not surprising to see we are where we are,” said Stefan von Haenisch, director of over-the-counter trading in Asia Pacific at crypto custody firm Bitgo Inc. Traders are still waiting for Trump to come up with concrete steps for the sector including a Bitcoin stockpile, he said.Investors are now being forced to consider quite how far the world’s biggest cryptocurrency can fall. There is support for the coin around $70,000, said Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at crypto platform YouHodler, pointing to technical analysis. But he said investors shouldn’t assume the rout in Bitcoin will get that bad.“We will only see this level if negative sentiment dominates the equity markets,“ said Lienkha.Bearish sentiment has also hit spot US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds . Investors have pulled a record $3.3 billion from US spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in February, poised for the biggest monthly exodus since they debuted, as investors sought refuge in safer assets amid rising geopolitical tensions and persistent inflation concerns.Trump has already made a few changes that have pleased crypto bulls, including putting crypto advocates in key positions. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which embarked on a yearslong crackdown under former Chair Gary Gensler, has also closed investigations into several crypto outfits in recent weeks.Trump has said he wants to make the US “the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world.”","The original cryptocurrency tumbled as much as 7.2% to $78,226 at one point Friday.

Many analysts believe these factors are pushing investors away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.After a strong run in the markets, sentiment took a hit this week when Trump confirmed that a 25 per cent tariff on Mexico and Canada would take effect on 4 March, with an additional 10 per cent levy on China to follow.Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $109,241 on 20 January, the day of Trump’s inauguration, but has since plunged almost 25 per cent as traders unwind bets placed on the back of his election.The sell-off gained momentum during Friday’s Asian trading session, driven by growing concerns over Trump’s aggressive trade policies and broader economic instability. His pledges to slash taxes and immigration also raised fears of renewed inflation, which could compel the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated.","The world’s largest digital asset dropped to $79,525.88 during early Asian trading on Friday.

Adding to their pain is the tightening of post-education work visa norms, which dims chances of higher pay abroad and repay loan sooner back home.In six months, the rupee has depreciated by about 5% to 87.2 against the dollar from 83.5 in Aug. That's an increase of Rs 5 lakh on a Rs 1-crore tuition-plus-expenses budget.At the same time, the UK has proposed requiring international graduates to secure graduate-level jobs with salaries between 36,000-40,000 pounds to stay beyond two years. Canada too is tightening immigration rules for Indian students, by allowing officials to cancel permits and ending the Student Direct Stream visa program.""Earlier, students used the post-education work visa to earn in dollars and repay a large part of their loans. For Indian students in undergraduate programs, the impact could be severe as their total cost of education is in excess of Rs 1.5 crore in the US,"" said Ajay Bohora, co-founder of education loan company HDFC Credila.This means either a longer repayment period or higher EMIs on their education loans , said Bohora. The weak rupee also increases costs for students flying back. According to Bohora, the higher financial burden on families will require students to be more frugal.""I am now sending $800 a month instead of $900 for my daughter's food & board in the US. Govt has, on top of that, put TCS, which is an additional burden. So, on my tax-paid money, I am paying tax for the second time via TCS. Though I can get a refund, it has blocked my tax-paid money for a year,"" said Sudha Pai, a Mumbai resident.""While fluctuations are a regular phenomenon, this year there has been a huge upward rise in the dollar. Coupled with the uncertainty caused by the political scenario in the wake of elections, the impact on overseas education has been huge,"" said K P Singh, an education counsellor & founder, Institute of Management & Foreign Studies.According to Karan Gupta, a career counsellor, parents can 'lock in' foreign exchange rates by getting a loan sanctioned early and transferring funds to the university account to hedge against depreciation. ""Students should avoid foreign currency loans, as it would be more expensive to repay when they return to India. They should also apply to universities that offer financial aid and scholarships, thereby reducing their financial burden,"" said Gupta.Bohora attributes the restrictions on student work visas to ""economic patriotism,"" which is on the rise in the US, the UK, and Canada.The US has signalled its intent to attract highly skilled global talent to drive technological innovation and economic growth. Indian students who want to pursue higher education in the US would have to explore emerging fields such as GenAI, cybersecurity, distributed finance, blockchain, and digital currencies to enhance job prospects.According to Singh, students should not focus solely on traditional fields like coding and programming but should explore new-age areas. He added that those without the financial resources should not take risks by pursuing courses with limited employment potential.","In six months, the rupee has depreciated by about 5% to 87.2 against the dollar from 83.5 in Aug.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy .In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

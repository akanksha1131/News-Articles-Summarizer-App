Stocks to buy: Why Raamdeo Agrawal is in love with ‘bruised blue chip’ stocks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stocks-to-buy-why-raamdeo-agrawal-is-in-love-with-bruised-blue-chip-stocks/articleshow/116166981.cms,"Raamdeo Agrawal said that the current market is ideal for stock selection due to valuations and earnings decline.

How to identify ‘bruised blue chips’

Raamdeo Agrawal , chairman of Motilal Oswal Financial Services recommends investing in ‘ bruised blue chips ’. He highlighted that Motilal Oswal Financial Services’ wealth creation study this year focuses on turnaround stocks , particularly examining profitable opportunities in temporarily troubled blue-chip companies.In an interview with ET, Raamdeo Agrawal said that the current market is ideal for stock selection due to valuations and earnings decline. Corporate profits may recover in Q4 of the current fiscal year, he said.Asked about ‘bruised blue chips’ Raamdeo Agrawal cited Asian Paints and D Mart as examples of genuine blue chips facing current challenges.Agrawal explained Motilal Oswal Financial Services’ criteria: bruised blue chips are those that show a decline exceeding 50% from their peak values. Their definition of blue chips includes the top 50 Nifty firms plus companies within the top 250 that maintained a 20% ROE average over ten years.Also Read | ‘US Department of Justice has no business…’: Mark Mobius says US DOJ overstepped bounds on Adani case Currently, 107 companies within the top 250 qualify as blue chips. Historical examples include Mahindra and Mahindra and Bharti Airtel, he said.Present-day ‘bruised blue chips’ include approximately 10-11 companies showing over 30% decline from their peaks. These include several Adani companies, Asian Paint (down 30-33%), Avenue Supermarket (down 30-33%), Tata Elxsi (down 40-45%), and Berger Paints (down 37-38%), Agrawal explained.“For us, a fall of 50% is very important. Right now, except for a few Adani companies, none of the other companies have crossed 50%. Now, what is the importance of 50% or 70%? It is the asymmetric payoff. When 100 becomes 50 and my blue chip goes back to 100, it’s a doubler for me. So, if it happens two years after my purchase, it’s a 40% return. If it happens in three years, it’s a 25% return and in four years, it is 18%. But the beauty is that I am buying an option into future prosperity,” he said.He also said that investors should adjust their expectations for reduced returns moving forward. “A lot of people understand that they have got excessive returns and that future returns are going to be very low. But nobody is bothering about that. I look at only one thing: Earnings growth. If there are earnings, everything is fine. If there are no earnings, everything is wrong. Given that, we should be in for further correction but the domestic flows are so strong that the market is holding up,” he said.","Raamdeo Agrawal, chairman of Motilal Oswal Financial Services recommends investing in ‘ bruised blue chips ’ He said that the current market is ideal for stock selection due to valuations and earnings decline.

Flipkart IPO : Flipkart, currently valued at $36 billion and recognised as India's premier ecommerce company, has set its sights on going public. The organisation is establishing a clear schedule of 12-15 months for its initial public offering (IPO), according to several individuals familiar with the plans. This forthcoming share issue, anticipated to be the largest by a new-economy company, represents a significant milestone for India's startup ecosystem, now ranked third globally.The company, under Walmart's ownership, has received internal clearance to shift its registration from Singapore to India, which is considered essential for the IPO process. Sources informed ET that the company aims to launch its public offering either by the end of next year or within 2026's first quarter.Flipkart IPO is likely to be the first among a group of approximately twelve new-age companies planning to enter the stock market in 2025. This follows the successful market entries of various consumer internet businesses, including Zomato, Nykaa and Swiggy, which have generated substantial interest among retail investors in Indian startups.The ecommerce leader has successfully secured nearly $1 billion in funding this year, with Google contributing $350 million. Although IPO discussions began in late 2021, they were temporarily suspended due to unfavourable market conditions during 2022-23.At Flipkart, under the leadership of group CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy, the priority remains enhancing profitability whilst maintaining growth rates marginally above the industry standard.Walmart's October quarter earnings report highlighted Flipkart's impressive performance, noting double-digit growth during its signature Big Billion Days sale , which positively impacted Walmart's global revenue.Industry analysts have calculated that Indian ecommerce achieved Rs 1 lakh crore in gross sales during the festive period this year, with Flipkart retaining its market leadership position during this crucial season.Established in 2007 as an online bookstore, Flipkart's parent company is based in Singapore. This was a common practice among prominent startups of that era, who established holding companies overseas due to favourable funding conditions and regulatory frameworks.PhonePe, previously Singapore-based, relocated its domicile to India, resulting in $1 billion in tax benefits for the Indian government. Any potential merger between entities in India and Singapore would trigger tax implications. PhonePe completed its separation from Flipkart in late 2022, subsequently securing external funding from investors, including its primary stakeholder, Walmart.","Flipkart IPO is likely to be the first among a group of approximately twelve new-age companies planning to enter the stock market in 2025.

Macro matters

MUMBAI: RBI's incoming governor Sanjay Malhotra faces the challenge of balancing economic growth, inflation, and exchange rate stability - a battle that outgoing governor Shaktikanta Das was still fighting. At the same time, he has to deal with regulatory reforms affecting bank lending, curbing digital fraud, and addressing retail financial product mis-selling .The rupee has come under severe pressure following the US elections, with the dollar gaining strength and FPIs selling stocks. At the same time, senior ministers in govt have called for softer interest rates to support investments.For a central banker, the concept of the impossible trinity refers to the idea that they cannot pursue independent monetary policy, manage the exchange rate, and allow free flow of capital.Forex dealers said that the rupee had weakened in the non-deliverable forward market on Monday, which may result in a weak opening on Tuesday. While RBI is under pressure to cut rates in Feb given the slowdown in the economy in the second quarter, any pressure on the exchange rate would make this difficult.In a note released earlier this month, Rahul Bajoria, an economist with the Bank of America, highlighted RBI's ""three-body problem"" as it navigates slowing growth, elevated inflation, and exchange rate pressures.On the regulation side, Malhotra faces the challenge of implementing key regulatory changes. This includes requiring banks to make provisions for bad loans based on expected credit losses, which would hit their bottom line as well as their ability to lend in the short term but put them in a better position to deal with defaults in the future.RBI had also proposed to bring down bank exposure to project loans by requiring lenders to make hefty provisions for projects that do not get completed on time - thus completely discouraging banks from project loans. However, govt still sees a role for banks in funding investments by corporates.On the retail side, while the banking system has taken major steps on the digital front, a side effect has been a growing number of online frauds. While banking systems are secure, people are losing money to confidence tricksters who fool consumers into believing that they are remitting money to genuine billers or govt. The cyber cells of police authorities are overrun with complaints about digital fraud, and RBI is under pressure to curb these.Another issue on the retail side has been the misselling of insurance and other financial products by banks.","RBI's incoming governor Sanjay Malhotra faces the challenge of balancing economic growth, inflation, and exchange rate stability.

Several Jewelry Stocks Soared in India This Year

India’s Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. is expecting the country’s insatiable appetite for discretionary goods and the government’s push to expand manufacturing to spur the next leg of a rally in related shares.Chief Investment Officer Niket Shah said he’s adding shares of companies that offer lower priced non-essential goods, such as jewelry and apparel, on expectations of increased spending. He’s also scouting for opportunities in India’s growing electronic component sector. The asset manager’s Motilal Oswal Midcap Fund has returned about 63% in the last 12 months against a 33% gain in its benchmark, making it the top mutual fund in the nation.As food inflation remains high, the government will try to put more money in the hands of the people, said Shah, who oversees more than $7 billion. “I’m expecting meaningful changes to the income tax code that will benefit consumers at large,” he said.While rising prices have hurt demand for fast-moving consumer goods companies, people aren’t willing to dial down on some discretionary spending, said Shah. People earning lower incomes are “aspiring to get high-end phones,” even if that means sacrificing on basic expenses, he said.Spotting sector inflection points and making timely exits have helped the fund’s performance, Shah said. He bought telecom companies Bharti Airtel Ltd., Indus Towers Ltd. and Vodafone Idea Ltd. before the industry implemented fare hikes. Bets on technology stocks Persistent Systems Ltd. and Zomato Ltd. also added to gains.In electronics manufacturing, production-linked incentives will likely boost the sector as the nation seeks to expand its role in global supply chains, according to Shah.“I’m also getting the sense that the government is slowly moving in favor of allowing some Chinese firms to set up joint ventures in India,” he said. “With technology from China and manufacturing done in India, there is a lot more scale that is achievable.”As of Nov. 31, Motilal held Kalyan Jewellers India Ltd. and affordable fashion retailer Trent Ltd. in various portfolios.

MUMBAI: In a fresh turn of events in the Kalyani family dispute, Sugandha Hiremath - Hikal director and sister of Bharat Forge chairman Baba Kalyani - has disputed the legitimacy of her late mother's wills, which primarily benefits her two brothers Baba Kalyani and Gaurishankar Kalyani.Their mother had made two distinct wills before her death in Feb 2023. The first, in Jan 2012, primarily benefits Baba (75) while the second, in Dec 2022, names Gaurishankar (69) as the beneficiary.Sugandha (72) challenged both wills' validity at the Pune civil court last week, claiming her brothers obtained them through coercion and undue influence. The contested assets encompasses shares in Kalyani Group companies such as Bharat Forge and Kalyani Forge, alongside precious jewellery made of gold and diamonds, fixed deposits, and various immovable properties across Maharashtra. This includes family home Parvati Niwas in Pune and land parcels in hill stations of Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar.She has raised objections after her brothers initiated separate probate proceedings in the Pune civil court. In her affidavits opposing both probate applications, Sugandha highlighted that her brothers have presented wills that are ""diametrically opposite and contrary to one another"". She asserts that these wills were secured to usurp the Kalyani joint family estate when their mother was under the respective care of each brother.During the signing of the first will in 2012, their mother Sulochana Kalyani had difficult relations with Gaurishankar and depended significantly on Baba for financial and emotional support. When the second will was signed in 2022, she was under Gaurishankar's care.Sugandha maintains that both wills lack validity and genuineness and hence the estate should be distributed to the heirs by way of intestate succession, granting her a one-third share. She contests the inclusion of certain properties in both wills, stating they belong to Kalyani joint family assets established by her father and grandfather, which legally cannot be bequeathed through a will.Sugandha claimed that during the signing of the first will, her father was unwell and had a troubled relationship with Gaurishankar. Baba took advantage of these circumstances to obtain their mother's signature on the will. Regarding the second will, Gaurishankar compelled their mother to sign while she was mentally vulnerable.","Sugandha Hiremath is the sister of Bharat Forge chairman Baba Kalyani.

MUMBAI: Stocks and bond markets could expect a straight-talking new RBI governor who is focussed on growth and faster technology adoption by banks. However, brokerages are divided if Sanjay Malhotra, the incoming RBI chief, would go for a faster easing of interest rates.According to a report by Goldman Sachs, Malhotra's expertise in taxation has played a key role in shaping direct and indirect tax policies. Analysts at the global financial major feel that Malhotra is expected to use those skills to influence RBI's monetary stance when there is heightened global uncertainty.According to Bank of America (BofA), the RBI chief faces the immediate challenge of dealing with a sharper-than-expected slowdown in growth, coupled with the near-term volatility in inflation while also ensuring a stable currency. However, analysts at BofA are not clear what his policy bias could be. They also feel that with a new governor, the risks of a rate cut, even if inflation comes off sharply, have declined materially.The Japan-headquartered financial major Nomura, however, has an opposite stance about RBI's move on rates under the new chief. It feels with Malhotra, a finance ministry insider at the helm, the path has been cleared for more and urgent easing. Nomura analysts feel that Malhotra's experience has given him an acute appreciation of govt's revenue generation and the importance of growth. They also flagged that there is likelihood of a shift towards more accommodative monetary policy.According to domestic brokerage house Emkay Global, Malhotra is straightforward in policy communication. During his stint at the department of financial services, he had pushed banks to adopt and focus on technology too. It also pointed out that with the important post of revenue secretary at the finance ministry now vacant, with less than two months for the next Budget, govt will need to fill that position imminently, to ensure minimal disruption to the planning and execution of the Budget.","Sanjay Malhotra's expertise in taxation has played a key role in shaping direct and indirect tax policies.

T+0 settlement: More stocks added,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/t0-settlement-more-stocks-added/articleshow/116188899.cms,"ONGC

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi has decided to expand the list of stocks for the optional T+0 mode of trading & settlement to include 500 more from Jan 31. Currently, the T+0 settlement cycle is offered for 25 select stocks that include SBI, ONGC and Bajaj Auto. The mechanism was started in March this year.A Sebi circular said that as a first step, top 500 stocks will be selected according to market capitalisation on Dec 31. In the first phase, the T+0 settlement will be available in the last 100 stocks of the 500 selected. In each month thereafter, the next bottom 100 stocks will be added to the list, it said. The process would start on Jan 31, 2025.Under the T+0 (same day) settlement system, investors will get their stocks and funds at the end of the day they put in their trades. India is the first country to move into such a stock trading process .Globally, and in India too, the more prevalent mode of settlement is the T+1 process. Under the T+1 settlement system, buyers and sellers of stocks get them in their demat accounts and the money in their bank accounts a day after the day of trade.On Tuesday, Sebi said that all brokers would be allowed to offer the T+0 settlement system to their clients. From May 2025, even custodians, who serve large investors including institutional ones, would join the system and block trades would be offered under this process too.Sebi has asked qualified stock brokers with a minimum number of active clients as of Dec 31, 2024 to put in place systems so that their clients can participate in the T+0 settlement cycle. New QSBs will get three months to put in systems compliant with the T+0 process, it said.The regulator has also asked stock exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories and custodians to work on systems so that institutional investors can participate in this shorter mode of settlement.Earlier, Sebi had said that once the T+0 mode of settlement is fully implemented, it would move to an instant settlement mode.","Currently, the T+0 settlement cycle is offered for 25 select stocks that include SBI, ONGC and Bajaj Auto.

MUMBAI: Outgoing RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that restoring the inflation-growth balance is the most important task ahead for his successor Sanjay Malhotra .In his last press conference as governor, Das highlighted the importance of coordination between RBI and govt in curbing inflation. ""Govt undertook a lot of supply-side measures which helped RBI check inflation. The same level of coordination continues even as I am speaking to you.""The governor also defended RBI's position on maintaining the status quo on rates despite slowing growth. ""Growth is impacted by a multiplicity of factors, not just one factor of the repo rate,"" he said.Das - who had, at the beginning of his term, said that he would do ""everything to uphold the professionalism, core values, credibility, and autonomy of RBI"" - said that RBI had grown stronger as an institution in recent years.Before demitting office, Das, in a social media post, expressed gratitude to PM Narendra Modi for the opportunity to serve, and to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for her constant support and backing. He also acknowledged the trust and confidence of former FM, the late Arun Jaitley, during his early days at RBI.""The consultative approach, the flexible inflation-targeting framework, and initiatives like the Bimal Jalan Committee, which was established after I joined RBI... many things have been institutionalised. Aspects of this institution, which were not formalised earlier, have been formalised and this is adding to the strength of the economy,"" he said.Responding to a query on the market perception that bureaucrats from the finance ministry appointed to head RBI would do govt bidding, Das said: ""RBI's governor looks at things from the Reserve Bank's perspective and the mandate given to the institution. But while fulfilling the mandate, the governor has to keep in mind the requirements of the wider economy. Decisions are a synthesis of both, and ultimately, it is a judgment call every governor makes.""Before the press conference, Das said that during his six-year tenure, the coordination between the finance ministry and RBI has been excellent. ""We've had excellent cooperation before, during, and after Covid, especially during the inflation spike after the Ukraine war began. Govt took supply-side measures that complemented RBI's efforts to control inflation. This level of coordination continues to date,"" he said.Despite significant changes in the monetary policy committee - including the addition of three new external members and the absence of both Shaktikanta Das and deputy governor Michael Patra at the next meeting - the outgoing governor expressed confidence that continuity would not be an issue.",Outgoing RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said restoring the inflation-growth balance is the most important task ahead for his successor. Das highlighted the importance of coordination between RBI and govt in curbing inflation.

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi plans to use government's DigiLocker system to reduce instances of unclaimed assets in the securities market. This includes MF folios and stocks left with fund houses and depositories after the death of an investor.The regulator has proposed that fund houses and depositories should provide demat and MF holding statements on DigiLocker. Sebi also wants KYC Registration Agencies (KRAs) to share information on an investor's demise with DigiLocker.By integrating DigiLocker with the process of transferring these assets to the rightful heirs, Sebi intends to minimise unclaimed assets in the securities market. It has come out with a draft circular on this issue and has asked for public comments by December 31.DigiLocker is a govt-initiated digital document storage platform that currently integrates Aadhaar, PAN, driving licence and a host of other govt-issued documents on a single, digital app.In December 2020, govt notified to integrate bank accounts, insurance policies and statements of new pension schemes on the DigiLocker platform. ""The proposed inclusion of MF and demat holding statements within DigiLocker can make available the entire financial holdings of individuals in a single DigiLocker account,"" Sebi's draft circular noted.In October 2023, Sebi had initiated a centralised process for reporting the death of an investor through the KRAs. The proposed method of integrating the same with DigiLocker aims to further smoothen the process. Currently, DigiLocker users have the option to nominate individuals for their accounts. Sebi now wants KRAs to also share information about an investor's death with DigiLocker, after verifying such information.""At Sebi's instance, the Digital India Corporation (DIC) has created a mechanism where the DigiLocker system automatically notifies the DigiLocker Nominee(s) about demise of the user through SMS and e-mail,"" the draft circular said.",Sebi plans to use government's DigiLocker system to reduce instances of unclaimed assets in the securities market.

Hope for progressive regulatory regime: Amazon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hope-for-progressive-regulatory-regime-amazon/articleshow/116188335.cms,"Amit Agarwal (File photo)

There is a perception within govt that Amazon is engaging in predatory pricing, killing kiranas...

Do regulatory challenges impact growth trajectory?

CCI says you and your partners are hampering investigation...

Are you still burning cash to capture market? Are you closer to profitability?

What are your quick commerce plans? Aren't you late to market?

As you sharpen focus, where will you invest?

At a time when Amazon faces regulatory scrutiny in India, including a probe by the Competition Commission of India , Amit Agarwal, senior VP, emerging markets, who kick-started the American retail giant's India operations, says the company is compliant with all regulations and expects fair and transparent policies from govt. ""My hope is for a progressive regulatory regime that embraces e-commerce as a key enabler of India's economic growth,"" Agarwal told TOI. Excerpts:We try not to pay attention to the noise out there and try to keep our heads down, focus on adding more selection and making things more affordable for customers. We have a lot of support from govt, which is recognising the work that we are doing. Our approach has been very transparent.Our job is to comply with regulations and offer customers a great experience. My hope for a regulatory regime would be that of a progressive one that embraces e-commerce as a key enabler of India's economic growth. E-commerce can enable job creation, manufacturing and exports. If we have the right progressive policy...the opportunity is consumption can increase, while share of e-commerce within that goes up. Key elements of a good, progressive policy would be lesser regulatory burden on sellers, lower friction for sellers to come online, a fairer, transparent and even-playing field for all companies, to ensure that all can compete fairly to give customers a great experience.We cannot comment on any ongoing investigation. We have always complied with all regulations, laws of the land. We are co-operating with all investigations and providing all informations.We have no cash burn strategy. We are investing in logistics, infrastructure and these require hard investments, which we will do for the sake of our sellers so that they can deliver the products.We hear from our customers that they would like to have daily, essential products delivered to them quicker. Starting this month, we are piloting a service starting with Bangalore where our customers would be able to get a few thousand products (combination of grocery and non-grocery products) delivered in 15 minutes. The only truth is the rate of change is going up. You will have many more players, many more formats, lot more innovation as India grows and as e-commerce and retail grows.While we are constantly enabling more small businesses to come and add to selection, we have been investing in Amazon Pay, which is our mechanism to give customers access to credit. We are building infrastructure, looking for new ideas so that we can ship products to corners of the country faster and at lower cost. 85% of our new customers are coming from lower tier cities. Our latest round of investment was made into AWS because we are building more data centres, cloud capacities for local developers, public and private sector companies.

Two schools in Delhi received bomb threats via e-mail |RK Puram | Paschim Vihar | Delhi Police

NEW DELHI: Over 40 private schools in Delhi received bomb threats via email on Sunday night at 11.38 pm. Among these, five schools that received these threats are Delhi Public School in Vasant Kunj and in R.K. Puram, G.D. Goenka School and Doon Public School in Paschim Vihar, and Brilliant's Convent School in Pitampura.An official said calls of bomb threats were received from DPS RK Puram at 7.06 am and GD Goenka Paschim Vihar at 6.15 am.A team from the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) immediately reached the spot. The police, bomb disposal squad, and dog squad, along with DFS personnel, are checking the entire premises of the school.As of now, nothing suspicious has been found, a police official said.The schools were targeted in a threatening email, which claimed that hidden bombs were planted within the premises. The email asserted that multiple bombs were strategically placed inside the building, posing a significant threat to the students and staff.The anonymous sender demanded a ransom of $30,000, warning that failure to comply would result in the detonation of the bombs. The school administration took immediate action, sending students back home who came to attend classes. Parents were asked to pick up their children as a precautionary measure.""I planted multiple bombs inside the building. The bombs are small and hidden very well. It will not cause very much damage to the building, but many people will be injured when the bombs detonate. You all deserve to suffer and lose limbs. If I do not receive $30,000 I will detonate the bombs,"" the email read.Most schools that received the threat suspended their classes and sent students back home as officials said. Further checking was underway.Earlier on November 19, the Delhi high court directed the local government and police to create a thorough action plan, including a detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for handling bomb threats and similar emergencies. The authorities were given eight weeks to complete these instructions.The Court specified that the SOP should clearly outline the duties of all involved parties--law enforcement, school management, and municipal authorities--to ensure seamless coordination and implementation.Justice Sanjeev Narula's bench, responding to an application by Advocate Arpit Bhargava, instructed the Delhi Government and Police to complete a comprehensive action plan, including an SOP for managing bomb threats and related emergencies.The action plan must be developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including school representatives, law enforcement agencies, municipal authorities, and other state departments.Meanwhile, Delhi chief minister Atishi attacked the Central government and said that the BJP-ruled central government has failed in its only task of providing security.""After the daily incidents of ransom, murders, firing in Delhi, now threats of bombing of schools are being received. The law and order situation in Delhi has never been so bad before. The BJP-ruled central government has failed in its only task of providing security to the people of Delhi,"" Atishi posted on X.Former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal slammed Union Home Minister Amit Shah and said that the people of Delhi have never seen such a bad state of law and order.""The people of Delhi have never seen such a bad state of law and order in Delhi before.

Is Nissan's decline inevitable? Honda merger talks could hold key to survival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/is-nissans-decline-inevitable-honda-merger-talks-could-hold-key-to-survival/articleshow/116148355.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Is a Honda merger the answer?

Nissan is grappling with a severe financial crisis that could lead to bankruptcy within the next 12 to 14 months unless decisive action is taken. The company, once a leader in the automotive industry, is now in its worst position since Carlos Ghosn's dramatic efforts in 1999 to pull it from the brink of collapse.With profits plunging by 70 per cent and a recent $60 million loss, Nissan is scrambling to find a solution to its mounting troubles, reported Forbes.In an attempt to salvage its future, Nissan has outlined a major restructuring plan, targeting $3 billion in savings.This includes slashing 9,000 jobs globally and selling a significant portion of its stake in Mitsubishi Motors . The company is also cutting production by 20 per cent at key US facilities in Canton, Mississippi, and Smyrna, Tennessee, which together employ over 13,000 workers.In a rare move, CEO Makoto Uchida has taken a 50 per cent pay cut to signal the urgency of the situation.Nissan’s woes can largely be attributed to its struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing automotive landscape.The company’s electric vehicle lineup is minimal, with only two models available internationally, while cheaper Chinese EV alternatives are flooding the market. Despite these challenges, there are bright spots.In the US, the locally-built Rogue SUV remains a top performer, having sold over 189,000 units through September 2024. Similarly, the Qashqai continues to dominate in Europe.However, these successes are not enough to counteract the broader decline, as per Forbes.Nissan is now searching for a lifeline, and a potential merger with Honda could be the key to its survival. The two companies recently signed a partnership focused on electric vehicle development , and some industry experts are speculating that a merger could help combine resources to overcome current financial struggles.According to the Financial Times, while this idea remains speculative, it could provide Nissan with the strength it needs to compete in the increasingly competitive global automotive market.Reacting to the report, Nissan Motor India spokesperson said, “As a policy we do not comment on speculatory reports. Nissan remains committed to its India operations, dealers, partners, and customers. We remain on track for our plan announced earlier this year at the launches of the Nissan X-TRAIL and New Nissan Magnite.”Nissan’s future remains uncertain, and time is running out. The company must make bold decisions, such as finding a major investor or merging with Honda if it hopes to avoid the fate of bankruptcy.","Nissan has outlined a major restructuring plan, targeting $3 billion in savings.

Saudi Arabia is cutting oil prices for buyers in Asia by more than expected after OPEC+ further delayed an output revival, underscoring how the outlook for the market remains weak.State oil producer Saudi Aramco will sell its main Arab Light crude grade at a premium of 90 cents a barrel to the regional benchmark in Jan, according to a price list seen by Bloomberg. That compares with $1.7 for this month.Earlier, OPEC+ - led by Saudi Arabia and Russia - agreed to push back production increases planned for the start of January by another three months, following two previous delays.

TSMC rules

Trump tariffs

As South Korea descends into political chaos, its equity market risks falling further behind major tech rival Taiwan, which is basking in the glory of the global artificial intelligence boom.A near 30% surge in Taiwan’s stock benchmark this year, set to be the best since 2009, has already helped spur a historic divergence between Asia’s two tech-dominated markets. The island’s market capitalization now exceeds South Korea’s by about $950 billion as the world’s AI frontrunners from Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to OpenAI all increasingly turn to Taiwanese firms for supply.Looking ahead to next year, while both export-oriented economies face the risk of higher tariffs by incoming US President Donald Trump, many investors see Taiwan as less vulnerable given the reliance of American firms on its technology as well as its relatively better economic prospects.Such optimism, and a recent pickup in inflows into local stocks, also augur well for the Taiwanese dollar, which has fared better than the Korean won in 2024.“The structural theme of AI is likely to only get extended further, and this means we could see another year of Taiwan outperformance,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore. “The Korea discount may linger for longer given the recent political debacle, and the corporate governance reforms will have to be prioritized to get any closer to erasing this discount.”South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is fighting for his political life after his attempt to break an impasse in parliament by briefly imposing martial law backfired. The turmoil has cast a pall over the nation’s outlook and it also may impact the Corporate Value-Up program much touted by Yoon as a way to boost shareholder returns and eradicate the so-called Korea Discount, a term referring to the long depressed valuations of the country’s equities.Down more than 8% this year, the Kospi is one of the world’s worst-performing major equity indexes. Its underperformance versus Taiwan’s Taiex has deepened further this month.Taiwan’s equity-market outperformance has a lot to do with this year’s 80% surge in the shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s top advanced chipmaker that accounts for 37% of the benchmark’s weighting. The company is the major supplier of Nvidia and Apple Inc.’s most advanced chips.In contrast, shares of Samsung Electronics Co. — South Korea’s most-valued company — have been the biggest drag on its local market. Samsung’s stock has slumped 31% in Seoul this year on concerns that the firm is missing out on the AI boom due to slow progress on technological breakthroughs and lingering management woes.Overall, Taiwan’s exposure to AI goes far beyond TSMC: over 40 AI-related firms constitute about 73% of MSCI Taiwan’s index weighting, according to Goldman Sachs Group analysts. At 33%, Korea is a distant second in Asia and features SK Hynix Inc. and Samsung Electronics only.Analysts’ average earnings per share estimate for MSCI Taiwan has risen more than 33% this year to a record high, while that for MSCI Korea has declined 5% since a peak in August, Bloomberg compiled data shows.“If you think of Nvidia’s AI server market and so on, Taiwan is heavily involved in that value chain,” said Yan Taw Boon, portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. “Conversely, Korea has not performed as strongly as they have very little involvement in this new booming environment.”While the higher tariffs threatened by Trump are a universal challenge, there are reasons some investors believe that Taiwan’s treatment may be more nuanced and less punishing.“One will recall that many Taiwanese exports were exempt from tariffs last time around as they were key components of US tech supply chains,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Rajiv Batra wrote in a note. “This time is likely to be the same with TSMC seen as a major part of the Global AI trade.”The Wall Street bank sees Taiwan relatively better positioned than Korea in a trade war with the US.Another buffer for Taiwanese equities is the growing presence of local investors, especially when the global investment climate turns more capricious.“Taiwan retail investors’ home bias and the still interesting AI ramp-up theme should continue to drive participation in the stock market,” said Vivian Pai, fund manager at Fidelity International. Their increased awareness of long-term investing can help form strong consistent inflows into local stocks, she added.The Taiwan dollar has weakened about 5% against the US currency this year while the Korean won has fallen around 9%.“Both Taiwan and Korea are exposed to tariffs but Taiwan’s underlying economic fundamentals are more solid,” said Eddie Cheung, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “This should persist in 2025.”",Taiwan's market capitalization now exceeds South Korea's by about $950 billion. The world’s AI frontrunners from Nvidia Corp. to OpenAI all increasingly turn to Taiwanese firms for supply. While both export-oriented economies face the risk of higher tariffs by incoming US President Donald Trump.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116090685,imgsize-629060,width-400,resizemode-4/116090685.jpg"

Rexas Finance (RXS): The future of real-world asset tokenisation?

Tokenising real-world assets: A $379.7 trillion opportunity

Why Rexas Finance could hit $2.5

There’s no doubt that cryptocurrencies remain highly volatile assets. Investors seek high-yield projects, and while Ripple leads in cross-border blockchain transactions, a new contender is emerging. Rexas Finance (RXS) has a big vision of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation. By integrating traditional assets with blockchain technology, Rexas Finance creates opportunities for investors to penetrate high-value markets that have been hard to navigate, such as real estate and art. This analysis reviews the possibility of RXS replicating Ripple’s steps to the $2.5 mark and whether it would attract investors during the process.Ripple's popularity stems from its fast, low-cost global payment platform. Currently priced at $2.33, XRP boasts a market capitalisation of $133.6 billion, reflecting strong investor confidence. The coin is still dominant despite its prominent issues with SEC accusations of the company. RippleNet, the company's payment network, gained the confidence of many banks and financial institutions. This reinforces expectations for the future of XRP quite a lot. The investors’ mood is quite optimistic as many think of a positive outcome of the ongoing SEC case, which is likely to create new highs for XRP. Some analysts predict that the price might rise to around $3 only in the short term, while $5 is possible but only if Ripple can penetrate many institutional on-boards and acquire new customers throughout the industry. XRP provides steady growth, but other newer projects, such as Rexas Finance (RXS), which is focused on real-world asset tokenisation and other latest trends within the blockchain industry, are perceived to present opportunities for higher exponential returns.Unlike Ripple, Rexas Finance is focused on revolutionising the investment landscape by bridging conventional assets with blockchain technology. The project enables fractional ownership of high-value assets like real estate, gold, and art, broadening access for more investors. The presale has raised $21 million, selling 292 million RXS tokens out of a total supply of 1 billion. The current Stage 9 presale price of $0.125 marks a significant increase from the initial $0.030 price, reflecting a 320% surge. The next presale stage will sell for $0.15, with substantial growth potential after that. Rexas Finance’s decision to bypass venture capital funding and adopt a community-driven presale model has been a strategic success. This inclusive approach aligns with blockchain’s decentraliz\sation principles, fostering trust and loyalty among early investors.Rexas Finance’s selling point hits the point, showing how they can gain access to huge markets through tokenisation. The real estate industry is said to have a market worth around $379.7 trillion; when it comes to gold or other commodities, the entire segment is valued at $121.2 trillion. There is also room for expansion in the $65 billion annual revenue art market. Rexas Finance unlocks investment opportunities in high-value assets by tokenizing them, making it possible for people to invest in expensive properties and commodities without the usual constraints of high capital requirements. Users of Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad, among other of the platform’s tools, can develop their own tokenised assets and invest in fractionalized shares of luxury objects. This advancement makes it easier for people to hold assets while increasing security, transparency, and reach to users worldwide.Rexas Finance's presale performance, coupled with innovation in the business model, is why it can reach the $2.5 mark after launch. Since the token price is $0.125, this is a win-win situation for early investors who hope to get better rates before the token gets primary exchange listings in early 2025. Another factor that allowed the platform to attract a more extensive investor base is its listing on the CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko platforms. In addition, the $1 million giveaway, promising 20 prizes of 50,000 RXS tokens, generated a lot of buzz and engagement. Hitting the $2.5 target is not just wishful thinking. The combination of Rexas Finance’s existing and future focus on tokenizing global real-world assets and the community-building element will ensure explosive growth. As more and more people use Rexas Finance, and if the platform's innovation trend continues, the $2.5 mark is very much attainable.The price of Ripple (XRP) remains fairly stable for investing purposes, with its offerings revolving around the payments and remittance sector. For investors who want to take on a higher risk and expect better returns, there is Rexas Finance (RXS), which appears worth looking into. The token aims to leverage the growing market of tokenized real-world assets at a community level. It has been focused heavily on its pre-sale activities, giving it much room for growth. Rexas Finance is an exciting investment. It is currently priced at $0.125, but estimates project it to reach $2.5 post-launch. For those wishing to take advantage of the potential within blockchain technology these days, Rexas Finance cannot be overlooked.For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:Website: https://rexas.com Whitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf Twitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance Telegram: https://t.me/rexasfinance","Rexas Finance (RXS) has a big vision of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation.

President-elect Donald Trump’s pick of a crypto proponent to be the next head of the US securities regulator lifted Bitcoin to $100,000 for the first time as traders warmed to the prospect of relaxed regulations.The digital asset rose as much as 6.1% to $103,801 on Thursday before changing hands at $101,968 as of 6:45 am in London. The crypto market overall has jumped by roughly $1.3 trillion since Trump’s election victory on Nov 5 on a platform that includes a tight embrace of the crypto sector.Trump selected Paul Atkins to replace outgoing Securities & Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, who cracked down on digital assets after a 2022 market rout exposed fraudulent practices and sparked costly blowups.“This is a momentum rally,” said Jason Titman, CEO, crypto brokerage Swyftx. “Global spot volumes are above mid-pandemic levels and nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC chair just added to the carnival atmosphere.”On November 22, Bitcoin was less than $300 from achie ving $100,000 but fell back while remaining in sight of the landmark level. Crypto’s adherents view the six-figure number as a validation of controversial claims that Bitcoin is a modern-day store of value and a hedge for inflation risk. For critics, the digital asset lacks any fundamental value and is too exposed to speculative whims.Hitting $100,000 is “a huge milestone for token and crypto industry as a whole,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, a provider of liquidity for crypto derivatives. “We expect further momentum for the coming days.”US exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin have attrac ted a net inflow of about $32 billion this year, including over $8 billion since Trump became president-elect, data compiled by Bloomberg sho wed. The combined trading volume for digital assets and related derivatives across centralised exchanges climbed to a record of more than $10 trillion last month, according to CCData.Trump has vowed to undo a Biden administration clampdown on digital assets, install friendly regulators and turn the US into global home of crypto. The Republican even backed idea of strategic national Bitcoin reserve, though there are doubts over whether the latter objective is feasible.","The digital asset rose as much as 6.1% to $103,801 on Thursday before changing hands at $101,968 as of 6:45 am in London.

Another BTC rally is coming, and the meme coin market is already stealing headlines. The latest meme coin in the spotlight is Catslap .The project’s quirky narrative is centred around a feisty feline that slaps anything that gets in its way. The token exploded 1800% on its Uniswap launch , but its market cap is still incredibly low.Could SLAP be the next meme coin to explode? Catslap ($SLAP) introduces a slap-to-earn model that allows investors to earn crypto rewards by slapping their favourite memes. The more they slap, the more they earn, and the more the project burns.As the Slapometer count increases, so does the number of tokens burnt. The reward model has country and user leaderboards.Catslap was launched directly on Uniswap without any presales. The fair launch lays a level playing field for new investors.Aggressive marketing campaigns will go live over the coming weeks to strengthen the community. For those seeking a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, Catslap is a meme coin to watch out now. The $SLAP community has exploded to around 10,000 members onWith the dog coin niche saturated, investors have turned their attention to cat coins. According to CoinMarketCap, cat coins have a total market cap of under $5 billion now. That is incredibly low when compared to dog coins, which boast a market cap of close to $90 billion.The difference underscores the growth potential of the cat coin niche. It is taking off as Popcat (SOL) and Mog Coin (MOG) top the hot lists. For example, Popcat has exploded close to 8000% in a year, while MOG recorded 9000% gains.The problem, however, is that these cat coins are close to hitting their saturation points. MOG is closing in on a $1 billion market cap, and Popcat has already smashed it.Even if they dominate the niche, they don’t have much room left for growth. Not for multifold, explosive price surges.This is where new projects like Catslap enter the picture. Due to their low initial market caps, they are capable of turbocharged surges.For a better context, Catslap’s market cap is just around $10 million now. If it jumps over $100 million, it could yield close to 1000% returns for early investors. For Popcat to deliver similar gains, it would need to cross a staggering $10 billion market cap. Even large meme coins like Pepe hover under the $10 billion point.Catslap just burnt 25 million tokens as part of strengthening its price momentum. Token burns are commonly used in the crypto space to drive a token’s value. They cut down the permanent supply, which, in turn, could positively affect the price.SLAP is an Ethereum-based meme coin. The SLAP tokenomics solidifies the project’s commitment to long-term growth and sustainability.The $SLAP tokenomics focuses on stable and community-driven growth. It gives Catslap an edge over its cat coin competitors.Crypto influencer Austin Hilton, who commands a YouTube community of over 280,000 members, recently featured the project on his channel. He drew attention to the project’s growth potential as a new contender in the cat coin space.The meme coin community is ready to embrace another bull season. Catslap is positioned to pounce on the opportunity. It is too early to tell whether it can replicate the success of Popcat and Mogcoin.Catslap is available for purchase on decentralised exchanges like Uniswap. Investors can also purchase the token directly through Best Wallet, the popular non-custodial wallet. Both crypto and fiat payments are accepted.The token has undergone a security audit by Solidproof to mitigate risks of hacks and theft. $SLAP is live on both Dex Screener and DexTools.*You must be at least 18 years old to access this site.","Catslap ($SLAP) introduces a slap-to-earn model that allows investors to earn crypto rewards by slapping their favourite memes.

"Airbus cuts over 2,000 jobs amidst competition from Elon Musk's Starlink",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/airbus-cuts-over-2000-jobs-amidst-competition-from-elon-musks-starlink/articleshow/116002827.cms,"Germany will shoulder the primary burden of workforce reductions with 689 positions.

Airbus job cuts : Airbus has announced approximately 2,000 job cuts in its Defence and Space division, representing 5% of its second-largest unit. The company faces challenges from American competition in satellites, though the job cuts were less extensive than initially indicated by the company.European satellite manufacturers, traditionally specialising in sophisticated geostationary spacecraft, have struggled against the emergence of cost-effective small satellites in low Earth orbit, particularly due to the rapid expansion of "" Elon Musk 's Starlink constellation"".The Space Systems business will bear the majority of the 2,043 position cuts, with 1,128 roles affected following significant satellite-related losses. The European aerospace organisation confirmed there would be no forced redundancies.Germany will shoulder the primary burden of workforce reductions with 689 positions, whilst France faces 540 cuts, Britain 477, Spain 303, and other peripheral nations 34, according to a Reuters report.The establishment of Airbus by these four nations over five decades ago makes the distribution of workforce reductions a delicate political matter.France hosts Airbus's main headquarters and primary jetliner production, whilst Germany oversees defence and space operations. Spain manages military transport aircraft assembly, and Britain specialises in satellite payloads and communications systems.Airbus, which manufactures satellites, transporters and holds significant stakes in European missile, fighter and space-launch initiatives, issued a statement after Reuters disclosed the job cuts during union briefings regarding an efficiency assessment.Following October's announcement of potential cuts of up to 2,500 positions (7% of workforce) due to €1.5 billion in satellite-related writedowns, particularly affecting OneSat, Airbus has now detailed specific reductions: 250 positions in Air Power, 47 in Connected Intelligence, and 618 posts at divisional headquarters.These reductions are distinct from "" Project Bromo "", a proposed merger of Airbus, Thales and Leonardo's satellite operations to enhance competitiveness against Starlink. Both initiatives reflect efforts to strengthen Europe's space sector against mounting competition.The implementation of these job cuts, scheduled for completion by mid-2026, primarily targets administrative and management positions rather than operational roles, focusing on reducing overhead and fixed expenses.The governments of the founding nations, including France and Germany each holding 11% ownership, have received briefings about these reductions, which form part of the Proton reorganisation initiative.The proposed staff reductions constitute roughly 5% of the division's workforce, according to Airbus. This percentage suggests a slight increase in divisional staff numbers this year, as the cuts represent 6% of the reported workforce at end-2023.France's Thales, which maintains two collaborative ventures with Italy's Leonardo in satellites and services, is currently discussing plans with unions regarding 1,300 space-related position reductions.","Airbus has announced approximately 2,000 job cuts in its Defence and Space division, representing 5% of its second-largest unit.

"Afghan economy shows modest signs of growth but recovery remains fragile, says World Bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/afghan-economy-shows-modest-signs-of-growth-but-recovery-remains-fragile-says-world-bank/articleshow/115998852.cms,"Image credit: AP

Afghanistan's economy is showing modest signs of growth after two years of severe contraction, the World Bank said.In its latest development update issued late Wednesday, the financial institution said modest GDP growth of 2.7% was driven by private consumption. The partial recovery, coupled with falling food prices, helped to gradually improve household welfare.Before the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, Afghanistan's economy relied heavily on foreign aid and corruption was rife. Their takeover three years ago sent the economy into a tailspin, as billions in international funds were frozen, and tens of thousands of highly skilled Afghans fled the country and took their money with them.Afghan's exports remained stable in 2023-24 but imports surged, creating a widening trade deficit, according to the World Bank. This deficit, exacerbated by dependence on imports for essential goods like fuel, food and machinery, could pose a risk to the country's economic stability.Faris Hadad-Zervos, the World Bank's country director for Afghanistan, said long-term growth prospects required tapping into the substantial potential of the domestic private sector and improving the overall business environment.""Key to this is increased investment, providing access to finance to small businesses, and supporting educated and skilled women entrepreneurs so their businesses can thrive,"" said Hadad-Zervos. ""Without this, the country risks prolonged stagnation with limited prospects for sustainable development.""The update comes days after media reports that the Taliban have ordered educational institutions to stop providing medical training to women and girls. The Taliban have neither confirmed the order nor responded to the reports.On Thursday, the head of the UN children's agency Unicef said she was deeply alarmed by the reported restrictions.Unicef was determining the veracity of these differing accounts and welcomed efforts to address the issue, said the agency's executive director Catherine Russell.If confirmed, this ban was expected to immediately halt the medical education of thousands of women and jeopardize women and girls' access to health care, she added.""It would not only further limit the ability of women to contribute to society and earn an income but would also have far-reaching consequences for the health of the Afghan population. Lives would be lost,"" she warned.","Afghanistan's economy is showing modest signs of growth after two years of contraction.

However, China's share in Pakistan's total external debt went down to 22 per cent compared to 25 per cent in 2023 with Saudi Arabia increasing its share from 2 per cent in 2023 to 7 per cent in 2024.The World Bank's International Debt Report 2024 released on Tuesday ranks Pakistan among the top three loan recipients from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this year and also notes that Pakistan's high debt-to-export and debt-to-revenue ratios indicate a weakening fiscal position.The International Debt Report 2024 put Pakistan's total external debt (including that from IMF) at $ 130.85 billion in 2023, accounting for 352 per cent of its total exports and 39 per cent of gross national income (GNI) while Pakistan's total external debt servicing amounted to 43 per cent of total exports and 5 per cent of GNI.As per the 2023 edition of the report, Pakistan's total external debt (including that from IMF) was at $ 126.95 billion in 2023, accounting for 320 per cent of its total exports and 34 per cent of gross national income (GNI) while Pakistan's total external debt servicing amounted to 42 per cent of total exports and 4 per cent of GNI.According to the 2024 report, China had the single largest share of debt to Pakistan at 22 per cent share (about $ 28.786 billion), followed by World Bank's 18 per cent share ($ 23.55 billion) and Asian Development Bank's 15 per cent share ($ 19.63 billion).Saudi Arabia stood out as the second largest bilateral lender to Pakistan with 7 per cent of total debt or about $ 9.16 billion.Of the total external debt stock, about 45 per cent debt ($ 58.88 billion) belonged to the bilateral lenders and 46 per cent (about $ 60.2 billion) to multilaterals, while remaining 9 per cent debt belonged to private lenders led by bondholders with 8 per cent chunk, the 2024 report said.It further noted that of the total $ 130.85 bn, long-term external debt stocks stood at $ 110.44 billion; $ 11.53 billion was IMF credit and allocations and $ 8.878 billion was short-term external debt.According to newspaper Dawn, the financial strain was fiercest for the poorest and most vulnerable countries - those eligible to borrow from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA). These countries paid a record $ 96.2 billion to service their debt in 2023, the data showed.For some countries, the payments run as high as 38 per cent of export earnings but Pakistan even surpassed this landmark as its interest payments stood at 43 per cent of exports, it said, adding, Pakistan made the second-largest interest payments in South Asia while the interest payment by Bangladesh and India increased by more than 90 per cent in 2023, highest in the region.In September, Minister of State for Finance Ali Pervaiz Malik told a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee that Pakistan was facing a daunting task of repaying a staggering $ 100 billion external debt over the next four years, an amount which is nearly 10 times its current $ 9.4 billion foreign exchange reserves.The $ 100 billion external debt repayments from 2024 to 2027 are exclusive of any payments on account of the liabilities booked at the balance sheet of the central bank and the requirements for financing the current account deficitMeanwhile, the Pakistan government on Monday admitted that there are ""hiccups"" in implementing the IMF programme, but asserted its commitment to completing the $ 7 billion package.",World Bank's International Debt Report 2024 ranks Pakistan among the top three loan recipients from the International Monetary Fund.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Gold is expected to trade in a sideways range with a bullish bias, while silver is likely to continue its bull run, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

He shares views and recommendations for gold and silver investors:

Gold Price Outlook

Weekly View: Sideways to Bullish Bias ( 1 – 2 weeks)

MCX Trading Range: Rs 1, 03,400 – 1, 06,500 per 10 gm. (CMP 1,05,100 /10 gm.)

Gold price prediction today:Gold prices turned bullish witnessing new all-time highs in International spot markets on Tuesday amid positive momentum persisting for six straight days since last week. Concerns over the Fed’s independence bolstered safe haven appeal of yellow metal with renewed demand persisting as traders maintained bets on Fed easing.It ended with 5 % monthly gains while Silver also continued to outperform for the third consecutive month. The yellow metal securing solid monthly gains, was supported by safe-haven flows, Fed policy expectations, and persistent geopolitical & economic uncertainty.Meanwhile, a spurt in prices was combined with a technical breakout on weekly charts, while any short-term profit booking move in prices now is likely to be viewed as dip-buying opportunities within the broader bullish trend which could now persist for months ahead.On the other hand, the USD had seen a short-covering bounce in the current week from over one-month troughs across the board, driven by profit taking, as traders now cash in before the releases of crucial US business surveys & employment data due later this week.The US ISM Manufacturing PMI remains on the radar next as speculations over a jumbo interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) this month grow's. A 25 basis points (bps) September rate cut is fully baked in, with the CME Group’s Fed Watch Tool showing a 90% chance of the same in the meeting scheduled on 17 – 18 Sept.The headline ISM Manufacturing PMI is expected to advance to 49 in August from 48 in July, though remaining in contraction. On the other data front, the Greenback could come under renewed selling pressure, keeping the record rally in Gold alive. Additionally, concerns over the Fed’s autonomy amidst US President Donald Trump’s continued efforts to rope in more dovish appointments to the US central bank remain a drag on the USD, supporting the bright metal.The geopolitical developments between Russia and Ukraine also remain in focus, underpinning the traditional safe-haven Gold. On Sunday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine plans new strikes deep into Russia after weeks of intensified attacks on Russian energy assets, per Reuters. Trump noted last week that he was deeply disappointed, particularly in light of his recent attempts to mediate between Russia and Ukraine to bring an end to the war.Fundamentally with traders pricing in nearly 90 % chance of a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut by the Fed at the September policy meeting, which is up from 85% odds before the US PCE data released last week, according to the CME Fed Watch tool. Overall, any cautious pause in the rally in the near term is likely before the outcome of the US labour market report on Friday while broader bullish trend can still take prices to witness new highs in coming weeks.Technically speaking, Spot gold (CMP $ 3,485 per oz) had witnessed the Bull Cross of the 21-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 50-day SMA on daily charts keeping the buoyant tone intact. The immediate topside hurdle is seen at the new record high of $ 3,508 per oz, above which the $3,550 psychological level can also be challenged. Broader bullish trend may also take prices to challenge $ 3620 – 3640 per oz in coming months.Conversely, any profit booking move in prices during the current week with a daily close below $3,470 could be followed by a test of weekly low’s around $3,437 per oz, as the same remains a dip buying opportunity for investors on a positional basis.Silver (CMP $40.57 per oz.) on the other hand is also expected to continue its bull run while profit booking moves could also be seen. Silver may test $ 42.75 – 43.00 per oz. in Spot in coming 2 – 3 weeks (MCX Silver Rs 1,27,000 – 1,28,000 per Kg.)","Gold is expected to trade in a sideways range with a bullish bias, while silver is likely to continue its bull run, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

GST Reforms To Jobs: PM Modi's Eight Big Announcements For India During 79th Independence Day Speech

What is expected to be cheaper & dearer after GST slab changes ?

Modi government’s proposal on GST rate cuts and slab changes includes consolidating the tax brackets to three levels - 5%, 18% and 40% - by redistributing items from the 12% and 28% categories.

The proposed changes suggest uniform 5% taxation for all food items and textile products, currently spread across various rates.

Additionally, consumer durables are proposed for the 18% bracket, resulting in reduced GST for commonly used items like refrigerators, large TC sets and air-conditioners.

A 40% tax rate would apply to sin goods and select luxury items, such as large cars, likely eliminating the current cess system. Industries, particularly automobiles and textiles sectors, are actively advocating regarding these rate modifications.

The restructuring would likely result in approximately 99 per cent of items presently under the 12 per cent taxation moving to the 5 per cent bracket, whilst about 90 per cent of goods currently taxed at 28 per cent would shift to the 18 per cent category.

Expected Key Gainers from GST cuts

GST Council Meeting: Challenges for FM Sitharaman





The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting began on Wednesday to decide on rate cuts and slab changes for a majority of items under the indirect tax. The 56th GST council meeting will be held on September 3 and 4, after which the GST rate cuts promised by PM Narendra Modi during his Independence Day speech are expected to be announced. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is presiding over the meeting.GST changes are considered essential for strengthening domestic demand and offsetting potential losses faced by businesses due to the US imposing 50% import duty on Indian exports.Ahead of the meeting FM Sitharaman, speaking at a City Union Bank event, highlighted how the next generation of GST reforms would create a more transparent economic environment and reduce compliance requirements, particularly benefiting small enterprises.She spoke of the the compliance-easing taskforce established by PM Narendra Modi and stated: ""Complementing this, the planned rollout of the next generation GST reforms with a council meeting tomorrow (Wednesday) and the day after, and in the coming months, it will set an economy absolutely open and transparent.""Additionally, the government has shared plans to streamline registration and filing procedures to reduce business administrative burden.The simplified slab structure aims to eliminate classification-related concerns for businesses.The implementation of the strategy heavily depends on gaining support from all states, presenting a significant task for Sitharaman, who leads the influential council with state ministers and representatives from three Union Territories (Delhi, J&K and Puducherry).States under opposition leadership have intensified their demands before the meeting, seeking compensation for lost revenue. The Centre has acknowledged potential short-term revenue impacts but maintains that increased consumption will restore collection levels.The meeting gained significance following PM Modi's Independence Day speech, where he indicated a ""big reform of GST"" before the festival season, suggesting a ""very big gift"" for Diwali.The Council is scheduled to continue discussions tomorrow, with announcements expected after the completion of deliberations.","The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting began on Wednesday to decide on rate cuts and slab changes for a majority of items under the indirect tax.

Many common food items now in 5% or nil brackets





NEW DELHI: The GST Council, headed by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Wednesday agreed to the biggest ever revamp of the eight-year-old indirect tax regime by rolling out a two-rate structure of 5% and 18%, along with a 40% slab for a handful of sin goods and services.The new rates, barring the incidence on tobacco products, will come into effect from Sept 22, the first day of Navratri, which also usually marks the onset of the heavy buying season.The sweeping changes, which were catalysed by the Centre, have brought the curtains down on the 12% and 28% rates, and are aimed at simplification of the tax system and ending classification disputes. In other words, no more 'roti versus paratha' skirmishes. Now, all Indian breads will face zero GST, while all life health insurance plans purchased by individuals will be exempt from the levy.Several critical medicines are also being moved into the nil rate segment.Besides, the compensation cess is being done away with along with the implementation of the new tax rates. Existing rates on tobacco products will continue until loans and interests are repaid.Cars will get cheaper as small cars will attract 18% tax, instead of 29% (28% tax and 1% cess), while the larger ones, including SUVs, will face 40% GST instead of 50% (28% tax and 22% cess).Electric vehicles will remain at 5%.""The reforms have been carried out with a focus on the common man. Every tax levied on common man's daily use items have undergone a rigorous look, and in most cases, the rates have come down drastically.

Sitharaman complimented all states for helping thrash out a package largely put together by the Centre, and said states and the Centre sit together in the GST Council.While some opposition-led states had raised the issue of a hit to their revenue, the finance minister said the rate rationalisation will result in higher consumption and greater buoyancy. ""Nobody is a donor and nobody is a donee,"" she said, emphasising that reforms were motivated by the concern for the consumer and ""we were all into it"".Asked about revenue impact, revenue secretary Arvind Shrivastava said that based on the 2023-24 consumption base, the overall net fiscal implication was estimated at Rs 48,000 crore. He, however, added that the entire economy would benefit from the decisions of the council and the exercise is expected to generate buoyancy and will impact consumer behaviour. Besides, Shrivastava said, the decisions are expected to result in higher compliance and rate changes also have a bearing on the cash refunds and input tax credit. A key element of the GST Council's decision was on ending inverted duty structure in sectors such as textiles and fertilisers, Sitharaman said.She also dismissed suggestions that the exercise was the result of the US's decision to impose stiff tariffs on Indian exports, pointing out that the process had started a year-and-a-half ago. ""For almost eight to nine months PM Narendra Modi has been asking for relief for the public,"" she said. In his Independence Day speech, the PM had announced the changes, aimed at lowering prices and ushering in ease of living for small businesses and taxpayers.","The new rates, barring the incidence on tobacco products, will come into effect from Sept 22.

Donald Trump Warns India Of 'Big Problems' Over Russia Oil, Slaps 50% Tariffs Amid Sanctions Threat





Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton lashed out at US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) for deteriorating US-India relations through a 50% tariff imposition on India, which he claims has driven Prime Minister Narendra Modi towards Russia and China.""The White House has set US-India relations back decades, pushing Modi closer to Russia and China. Beijing has cast itself as an alternative to the US and Donald Trump,"" Bolton wrote on X.He criticised Trump's tariff decisions, stating they have undermined decades of Western diplomatic efforts to distance India from its Cold War alliance with the former Soviet Union (Russia) and address China's growing influence.In multiple other social media posts on Monday (local time), Bolton had claimed Trump's economic policies have compromised strategic achievements, whilst providing Chinese President Xi Jinping an opportunity to alter East Asian geopolitics.""The West has spent decades trying to wean India away from its Cold War attachment to the Soviet Union/ Russia, and cautioning India on the threat posed by China. Donald Trump has shredded decades of efforts with his disastrous tariff policy,"" Bolton posted.""Donald Trump's unwillingness to consider diplomatic moves in a larger strategic context has given Xi Jinping an opportunity to reset the East,"" he added in another post.Bolton, who served as national security adviser (2018-19) under Trump's first presidency, departed due to disagreements regarding the administration's foreign policy approach.His observations coincide with New Delhi's current challenges amid global economic uncertainty, following the US implementation of a 50% tariff on Indian imports, plus an additional 25% due to India's Russian oil purchases.The statements followed the 25th Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Heads of State Council summit in Tianjin, China, where Prime Minister Modi engaged with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping in bilateral discussions.According to a Ministry of External Affairs statement on Sunday, Modi and Xi Jinping acknowledged their nations' roles in maintaining global trade stability during their meeting.In his discussion with Putin, PM Modi highlighted the robust India-Russia relationship, noting their consistent mutual support during challenging periods.The Prime Minister emphasised that collaboration between New Delhi and Moscow remains crucial for international peace, stability and prosperity. Meanwhile, Putin highlighted that this year commemorates the 15th anniversary of the India-Russia 'Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership'.","Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton lashed out at US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) for deteriorating US-India relations.

Employment in unorganised sector dips in April-June quarter; no. of working owners up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/employment-in-unorganised-sector-dips-in-april-june-quarter-no-of-working-owners-up/articleshow/123688244.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Employment in India's unincorporated sector dipped marginally in the April-June quarter of the current fiscal compared to the previous quarter, though the number of enterprises rose, according to a quarterly survey released Wednesday.National Statistics Office (NSO) published first quarterly bulletin of unincorporated sector enterprises (QBUSE) with estimates for Jan-Mar and Apr-June 2025. It showed employment fell to 12.9 crore in the April quarter from 13.1 crore in Jan-March.Despite this dip, employment in both quarters remained substantially higher than the 2023-24 annual estimate of just over 12 crore workers, indicating an overall increase in sectoral jobs.NSO said April decline was linked to fewer establishments engaging hired workers and weaker performance of unincorporated manufacturing, where the employment share dropped by over 2 percentage points compared to the previous quarter.The total number of establishments in the unincorporated non-agricultural sector rose to 7.9 crore, driven by trade (3.6%) and other services (3.1%), while manufacturing contracted by 4.7%.The share of working owners rose from 58.3% in January-March to 60.2% in April-June, signalling a shift toward self-employment and owner-driven enterprises. Manufacturing saw the sharpest fall in hired workers alongside this rise in working owners.Women accounted for over 28% of the workforce in both quarters, slightly higher than the 2023-24 annual share, underscoring the sector's role in gender-inclusive growth. The rural workforce also grew, from 6 crore to 6.3 crore, pointing to the rising role of unincorporated enterprises in rural economies.Digitisation trends strengthened, with net use among enterprises climbing from 34% in Jan-March to 36% in Apr-June, highlighting growing digital adoption.Unincorporated non-farm establishments are those not registered under Companies Act, 1956 or 2013.",Employment in India's unincorporated sector dipped marginally in the April-June quarter of the current fiscal compared to the previous quarter.

GURGAON: Torrential rain lashed the city from 3:30 pm onwards on Monday, flooding several neighborhoods and bringing evening traffic to a standstill. Waterlogging, two to three feet deep in some areas, left vehicles stranded and traffic crawling for hours along key stretches, including a 4-km jam from Hero Honda Chowk to Narsinghpur on NH-48.

Vehicles stalled mid-road, while shopkeepers struggled to keep water out of their stores as the downpour showed no signs of easing. Commuters waded through strong currents, and two-wheelers were nearly swept off the roads in some areas.Residents said the situation recurs every monsoon, blaming poor drainage and unplanned construction. Despite repeated complaints, no permanent solution has been implemented, leaving even moderate showers to create dangerous conditions. Civic teams had yet to reach the area at the time of reporting, forcing locals to fend for themselves.“This looks like the heaviest rain of the season in Gurgaon.

Nestlé shake-up: Who is Laurent Freixe? CEO dismissed over ‘undisclosed romantic relationship with subordinate’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nestl-shake-up-who-is-laurent-freixe-ceo-dismissed-over-undisclosed-romantic-relationship-with-subordinate/articleshow/123650759.cms,"File photo: Laurent Freixe

Who is Laurent Freixe?

Born in 1962, French national Laurent Freixe devoted nearly four decades to Nestlé.

He joined the group in France in 1986, beginning in sales and marketing before moving into leadership roles across Europe.

He became market head of Nestlé Hungary in 2003, later taking charge of Spain and Portugal in 2007.

By 2008, he was appointed executive vice president and zone director for Europe, steering the region through the financial turbulence of the subprime and euro crises.

In 2014, Freixe took over as executive vice president and CEO of Zone Americas, covering the US, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean.

Eight years later in 2022, he became CEO of Zone Latin America before being promoted to chief executive officer of Nestlé SA in 2024.

in 2024. Fluent in French, English, Spanish and German, Freixe combined global business experience with governance responsibilities. He served on the boards of Cereal Partners Worldwide and the Consumer Goods Forum, chaired the Global Alliance for YOUth, and was a member of the European Roundtable (ERT).

He also held advisory positions with EDHEC Business School and the IMD Foundation Board.

Educated at EDHEC Business School in Lille with executive training at IMD, Switzerland, Freixe was known for his long service and operational expertise across continents.

His abrupt dismissal, however, ends a 40-year association with Nestlé on a controversial note.





Swiss food giant Nestlé has dismissed its chief executive Laurent Freixe with immediate effect after an internal investigation found he had an “undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate,” in violation of the company’s code of business conduct.The move was confirmed by the group on Monday, with chairman Paul Bulcke stating, “This was a necessary decision. Nestlé’s values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service,” as quoted by news agency AFP.The board said the investigation was overseen by Bulcke and lead independent director Pablo Isla, with support from external counsel. Freixe’s departure comes less than a year after he was appointed CEO in September 2024, tasked with reviving the company’s performance amid sluggish consumer spending and a sharp fall in its share price.Nestlé, which owns brands such as KitKat, Nespresso, Purina and Maggi, named Nespresso CEO Philipp Navratil as his successor.",Laurent Freixe has been dismissed as CEO of Swiss food giant Nestlé.

Wall Street steadied on Wednesday as a rebound in technology stocks, led by Alphabet, helped offset declines in the Dow, while fresh signs of weakness in the US job market bolstered hopes of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.The S&P 500 gained 0.3% by midday, putting it on track to snap a two-day losing streak after recently setting an all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.9%, lifted by strong gains in big tech stocks, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 179 points, or 0.4%, AP reported.Google’s parent company Alphabet surged 8.7% after a federal judge ordered changes to its search engine business but stopped short of forcing a breakup of its Chrome browser. “This is a relief, an outcome that is much better than feared for Google and for Apple,” said Chris Marangi, co-chief investment officer of value at Gabelli Funds. Apple rose 3% after analysts said it stood to continue benefiting from lucrative search deals with Google.Bond yields, which rattled markets a day earlier, retreated following weaker-than-expected labour data. The 10-year Treasury yield eased to 4.21% from 4.28% late Tuesday.The latest government report showed employers advertised 7.2 million job openings at the end of July, below forecasts, reinforcing expectations that the labour market is cooling.A softer jobs environment has strengthened the view that the Fed may cut interest rates at its policy meeting later this month. Traders widely expect the central bank to deliver its first rate cut of the year, though concerns linger that President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imports could add fresh inflationary pressures.Among individual movers, Macy’s jumped 17.1% after reporting stronger quarterly profit and revenue than analysts expected, its best sales growth in three years. The retailer also raised its full-year guidance. American Bitcoin, a mining and treasury firm linked to the Trump family, surged 28.1% in its Nasdaq debut after merging with Gryphon Digital Mining, with trading so volatile it was halted several times.Campbell Soup rose 4.9% on stronger-than-expected earnings but warned tariffs could weigh on next year’s profits. On the downside, Dollar Tree fell 7.1% despite beating earnings forecasts, as analysts pointed to high expectations and the risk of tariff-related cost pressures.Overseas, European markets edged higher while Asian shares closed mixed, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 falling 0.9% amid uncertainty over Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s political future.","S&P 500 on track to snap two-day losing streak after setting all-time high.

‘Much more needs to be done’: COP30 finance goal far behind with just 4-5% achieved; experts urge urgent action by 2030,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/much-more-needs-to-be-done-cop30-finance-goal-far-behind-with-just-4-5-achieved-experts-urge-urgent-action-by-2030/articleshow/123674313.cms,"AI image





The global funding target set for COP30 is far behind schedule, with only 4-5 per cent of the promised $1.3 trillion achieved so far, claimed Vishwas Chitale, Fellow, Climate Resilience at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).In an exclusive interview to news agency ANI, Chitale stressed that the $1.3 trillion target is crucial for climate action, yet progress has been slow. “Around 4-5 per cent of the target of 1.3 trillion dollar is achieved. We are really lagging behind the target. All the developing countries are supposed to contribute by 2030,” he said, while adding that if COP30 accelerates its efforts, the goal remains achievable.Chitale underlined that the momentum of climate finance remains largely dependent on developed nations, which have been the main contributors so far. “There is funding from developed countries for developing countries. Developing countries should stand for their commitments,” he pointed out.He explained that COP30 is not only focused on finance but also on broader synergies, including Rio synergies, climate action, and community resilience.“As a whole we can improve the land use and land cover practices. The main agenda is how COP30 delivers on the climate finance of $1.3 trillion and can we see some action happening on that,” he said.Recalling previous progress, Chitale said that while the loss and damage fund initiated at COP27 saw movement at the Dubai COP, “much more needs to be done to translate commitments into action, especially to meet the 2030 target.”On India’s role, he noted that the country has emerged as a strong voice for the Global South, leading negotiations on adaptation finance and resilience. He highlighted initiatives like the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), the Prime Minister’s ten-point agenda on disaster reduction, and Mission Life, describing them as “excellent steps.”Earlier, Andre Aranha Correa do Lago, President of COP30, was quoted by ANI as saying that developed countries carry “more responsibility” for climate change, having been responsible for carbon dioxide accumulation “for more than 250 years.”He stressed that Brazil and India, as part of the BASIC group, have been united in their negotiations, with both emerging economies expected to play a key role at COP30 in Belem this November.A Moody’s report, which came out earlier this year, had also warned that many governments are falling short of the Paris Agreement’s climate targets, with delays pushing countries to prioritise adaptation and resilience investments.The report flagged risks of a “climate investment trap” for emerging markets if funding gaps persist.Chitale concluded that more awareness and concrete action are needed to accelerate climate finance delivery. “It has a lot to deliver on that,” he said, pointing to COP30’s responsibility to ensure progress on both funding and resilience building.","Only 4-5 per cent of the promised $1.3 trillion has been achieved, claims Vishwas Chitale, Fellow, Climate Resilience at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) The momentum of climate finance remains largely dependent on developed nations, which have been the main contributors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123674345,imgsize-329111,width-400,resizemode-4/thriving-community-climate-resilience.jpg"

'Respect India Or West Will Lose': NATO Ally Finland President Stubb Warns Trump Amid Tariff War

Trump’s tariff plan for pharma





US President Donald Trump is mulling tariffs on the pharmaceutical sector - as high as 200%! Trump intends to levy substantial import duties on pharmaceutical products, a sector that has largely remained unaffected by his trade policies. Historically, imported medicines have entered the United States without customs duties.Recent developments indicate a shift in this approach. A trade agreement between the US and European nations has established a 15% tariff on certain European imports, including pharmaceutical products. Trump has indicated potential duties exceeding 200% on medications produced in other regions.PwC's tax specialist Maytee Pereira characterises Trump's pharmaceutical strategy by stating: ""Shock and awe. This is an industry that's going from zero (tariffs) to the potentiality of 200%,” Maytee Pereira told AP.The proposal to reduce drug costs for Americans through pharmaceutical tariffs could have unintended consequences. Such measures might actually increase prices, create supply chain complications, reduce access to affordable foreign-made generic medications, and lead to medicine shortages, according to the AP report.""A tariff would hurt consumers most of all, as they would feel the inflationary effect ... directly when paying for prescriptions at the pharmacy and indirectly through higher insurance premiums,'' Diederik Stadig, a healthcare economist with the financial services firm ING, wrote in a commentary last month, adding that lower-income households and the elderly would feel the greatest impact.This initiative coincides with ongoing pressure on pharmaceutical companies to reduce prices in the United States. Letters have been sent to various companies requesting plans for implementing most-favoured nation pricing domestically.However, the proposed tariffs include a grace period of 12 to 18 months, allowing pharmaceutical companies to build inventory reserves and relocate production facilities to the United States, actions some firms have already initiated.According to Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger's July 29 note, numerous pharmaceutical companies have increased their drug imports and maintained six to 18 months of stock within the United States.The financial expert David Windley from Jefferies indicated in his analysis that the impact of proposed tariffs scheduled for late 2026 might not be noticeable until 2027 or 2028, as companies would likely build up inventory.Industry observers anticipate that Trump would likely implement a tariff significantly below 200%. They are also observing whether specific products, particularly low-margin generic medications, would receive exemptions from these tariffs.According to Stadig's assessment, even a modest 25% tariff would result in a gradual increase of 10% to 14% in US pharmaceutical prices once existing stocks are depleted.Pharmaceutical companies have increasingly relocated their operations abroad over the past several decades, seeking cost advantages in China and India, whilst benefiting from tax incentives in Ireland and Switzerland. This shift has contributed to a substantial US trade deficit in pharmaceutical products, approaching £150 billion in the previous year.The global health crisis during COVID-19 highlighted the vulnerabilities of depending on international sources for medical supplies, particularly when nations prioritised their domestic needs. This situation became especially concerning when considering China, a significant supplier and strategic competitor to America.In April, the US government initiated an investigation into the national security implications of pharmaceutical imports. Under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president holds authority to impose tariffs when national security concerns arise.Health policy analyst Marta Wosińska at the Brookings Institution advocates for tariffs to protect US medical supplies. She highlighted how the Biden administration's taxation on foreign syringes protected US manufacturers from inexpensive Chinese imports.Trump advocates for relocating pharmaceutical manufacturing to the United States, suggesting US-manufactured drugs would be exempt from his proposed tariffs.Pharmaceutical companies are increasing their US investments. In April, Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, announced a $50 billion expansion of its US operations. Johnson & Johnson plans to invest $55 billion in the United States over four years. Their CEO Joaquin Duato indicated plans to exclusively manufacture US market drugs within the country.However, establishing new pharmaceutical facilities in the United States requires substantial investment and extended time periods.Furthermore, US-based manufacturing might still face tariff implications if imported ingredients are taxed. According to Jacob Jensen, trade policy analyst at the American Action Forum, ""97% of antibiotics, 92% of antivirals and 83% of the most popular generic drugs contain at least one active ingredient that is manufactured abroad.""The complete protection against tariffs requires establishing the entire supply chain within the United States, according to Pereira.Whilst branded pharmaceutical companies maintain substantial profit margins allowing them to handle investments and tariff costs, generic manufacturers operate with limited financial flexibility.Several generic manufacturers might exit the US market due to tariff pressures. This poses significant concerns as generics constitute 92% of US retail and mail-order pharmacy prescriptions.A temporary production halt at an Indian facility previously resulted in chemotherapy shortages, affecting cancer treatment. ""Those are not very resilient markets,"" Brookings' Wosińska said. ""If there's a shock, it's hard for them to recover.""Wosińska contends that tariffs alone cannot convince generic manufacturers to establish US-based facilities without governmental financial support.""In an ideal world, we would be making everything that's important only in the US,'' Wosińska said. ""But it costs a lot of money ... We have offshored so much of our supply chains because we want to have inexpensive drugs. If we want to reverse this, we would really have to redesign our system ... How much are we willing to spend?''","US President Donald Trump is mulling tariffs on the pharmaceutical sector. Trump intends to levy substantial import duties on pharmaceutical products.

'5-alarm fire': Congressman Rohit Khanna slams Trump tariffs; accuses President of undermining US-India ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/5-alarm-fire-indian-us-congressman-on-trump-tariffs-accuses-president-of-undermining-washington-delhi-strategic-ties/articleshow/123667547.cms,"Indian-US Congressman Ro Khanna (File photo/PTI)

'Economic Blackmail': Rahul Gandhi, Shashi Tharoor Rips Into Trump's 50% Tariff Move





Indian-origin Congressman Rohit ""Ro"" Khanna on Tuesday sharply criticised US president Donald Trump’s decision to impose 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods, warning it threatens decades of US-India strategic cooperation.Khanna, a Democrat and co-chair of the United States-India Caucus, accused Trump of 'undermining' three decades of bipartisan efforts that had strengthened the strategic US-India alliance.""I want to sound the five-alarm fire (alert for an exceptionally large and destructive fire) on what Donald Trump is doing to destroy the US-India relationship,"" Khanna said in a video posted on his X handle.The California representative added: ""He (Trump) has imposed a 50 per cent tariff on India, higher (joint-highest) than any other country other than Brazil. It's a higher tariff than the tariff on China. It is hurting India's exports of leather and textiles into the United States. And it's hurting American manufacturers and our exports into India. It is also driving India towards China and towards Russia.""Khanna also said the tariffs are pushing India closer to China and Russia - Washington's traditional rivals - and attributed the action to New Delhi’s refusal to nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize, despite his repeated claims of mediating the India-Pakistan conflict.""Now, why is this happening? For very simple reasons. Prime Minister Modi refused to nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize. Well, Pakistan did. And India has said that the border dispute with Pakistan is an internal matter, refusing to give Donald Trump credit,"" Khanna stated.The Congressman also stressed the strategic importance of the US-India relationship.""We can't allow the ego of Donald Trump to destroy a strategic relationship with India that is key to ensuring that America leads and not China. To all those Indian-Americans who voted for Donald Trump, I'm asking you, where are you today while he destroys this relationship?"" he remarked.Twenty-five percent of the tariffs imposed by Washington target New Delhi, citing its alleged support of Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s war effort in Ukraine through Russian oil purchases.

Jaguar Land Rover, the Tata Motors-owned luxury automaker, said on Tuesday its global retail and production operations have been “severely disrupted” following a cyberattack, forcing the company to shut down systems as a precaution.The UK-based company said it took immediate steps to shut down its systems in a bid to limit the fallout, AFP reported. “At this stage there is no evidence any customer data has been stolen but our retail and production activities have been severely disrupted,” JLR said in a statement, adding that it is “working at pace” to restart global operations.Luxury retailers and auto brands have become frequent targets of cyber gangs. Marks and Spencer was recently hit by an attack that crippled its online services for weeks and cost the retailer £300 million ($402 million). High-end department store Harrods and food chain Co-op have also faced cyber intrusions in recent months.The attack comes as another setback for JLR, which has been grappling with weakened demand and trade headwinds. In April, the automaker halted exports to the United States in response to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, leading to a sharp fall in sales.In July, the company said it would cut up to 500 UK management jobs to reduce costs. While a subsequent trade pact between London and Washington reduced the tariff on UK car exports to 10% from 27.5%, the relief applies only to a quota of 100,000 vehicles annually, leaving JLR with limited scope to recover volumes.",Jaguar Land Rover says its global retail and production operations have been “severely disrupted” following a cyberattack.

Sweden’s “buy now, pay later” financial services firm Klarna said on Tuesday it aims to raise $1.27 billion through an initial public offering in New York, setting a price band of $35 to $37 a share, after an earlier plan was delayed due to market volatility.Klarna had first announced plans for an IPO in November last year, but the listing was pushed back earlier this year as equity markets turned choppy. In its latest statement, the company said the offering would give it a market capitalisation of about $14 billion at the top of the price range, AFP reported.Founded in 2004 by three students, Klarna allows shoppers to pay for purchases up to 30 days later or in four instalments without interest. The firm said it generated a net profit of $21 million in 2024 on revenues of $2.8 billion, with commissions from online retailers forming the bulk of its income, alongside interest earnings on longer-term consumer financing.The IPO will comprise 34.3 million shares, with existing investors accounting for the overwhelming majority of the sale. Around 28.7 million shares will come from early backers exiting part of their holdings, while Danish businessman Anders Holch Povlsen, who owns the Bestseller retail clothing chain, plans to offload about 6.3 million shares.Klarna entered the US market in 2019 and has since grown its presence, but the company’s valuation has seen sharp swings. In 2021, at the height of the pandemic spending boom, Klarna was valued at $45.6 billion. Just a year later, that figure slumped to $6.7 billion as inflation surged, interest rates climbed and investor sentiment towards tech firms soured.The company did not disclose the date of its planned US listing but confirmed that its fresh filing marks a renewed push to tap global capital markets.","Sweden's Klarna aims to raise $1.27 billion through an initial public offering in New York.

Russia on Tuesday said it had signed a legally binding agreement with China to build the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, a project aimed at further strengthening energy and strategic ties between the two countries.The pact was signed during President Vladimir Putin' visit to Beijing, reported AFP.The planned pipeline, which would run through Mongolia, is expected to supply up to 50 billion cubic metres of gas annually, according to Russian state agency TASS.""Today, a very important step has been taken to further strengthen and develop our strategic partnership, to increase reliable supplies of clean energy, natural gas, to China,"" said Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller, according to AFP.He also confirmed that Gazprom and China’s CNPC will increase shipments by 15 percent through the existing Power of Siberia pipeline.The memorandum, however, is not a final contract.

Wall Street slid sharply on Tuesday as rising Treasury yields and political uncertainty dragged US stocks further from their recent record highs.The S&P 500 dropped 1.4% in what could be its worst day in a month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 516 points or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.7% by mid-day, though all three indices remain close to their all-time peaks, AP reported.Big Tech names led the sell-off. Nvidia, seen as a bellwether of the artificial intelligence boom, sank 3.6% and was the single biggest drag on the S&P 500. Amazon fell 2.2% and Alphabet dropped 2.5%, with analysts pointing to concerns that valuations in the sector have become stretched.The broader market felt pressure from the bond market, where the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.27% from 4.23% on Friday. Rising yields make bonds more attractive relative to equities, particularly high-priced growth stocks. Globally, longer-term yields have also been climbing amid growing concerns over governments’ ability to service ballooning debt.In the US, bond market sentiment was unsettled further by President Donald Trump’s repeated criticism of the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates sooner. Investors fear that political attacks could undermine the Fed’s independence, reducing its willingness to keep policy tight to contain inflation.Markets also reacted to a federal appeals court ruling late Friday that Trump exceeded his legal authority when announcing sweeping tariffs on nearly every country. While the ruling left the tariffs in place for now, analysts warned the move could increase uncertainty over fiscal revenues and borrowing needs. “Too much uncertainty for us and our customers regarding tariffs and the US/global economy,” one chemical products company told the Institute for Supply Management in its latest survey.That ISM report showed US manufacturing contracted more sharply than economists expected last month, adding to evidence of tariff-induced disruption. The data briefly trimmed Treasury yields and reinforced expectations that the Fed could cut interest rates at its next meeting, with markets already pricing in a move. Friday’s upcoming jobs report is expected to provide the next key signal.Safe-haven demand lifted gold, which jumped 2% after hitting a fresh record. “Tariffs are continuing to make conditions chaotic,” ISM respondents noted, underscoring rising investor demand for havens.On the corporate front, Constellation Brands tumbled 6.9% after warning of weaker demand for high-end beers, particularly among Hispanic consumers, and slashing its profit forecast. Kraft Heinz slumped 7% after announcing plans to split into two companies—one focused on shelf-stable meals including Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese, and the other on cold storage brands like Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. Official names are yet to be revealed.Among gainers, PepsiCo rose 2.1% after activist investor Elliott Management disclosed it had sent proposals to the board urging accelerated growth and stronger financial performance.

Why Nestlé sacked its CEO



Who is Philipp Navratil, the new Nestlé CEO?









Swiss food giant Nestlé on Monday sacked its chief executive, Laurent Freixe, with immediate effect after an investigation found he had an “undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate”, in breach of the company’s code of business conduct.Freixe, who joined the firm in 1986, had only been promoted to CEO in September 2024 after leading its Latin America division.Freixe’s exit places him among a growing list of high-profile business leaders forced out over workplace relationships. As per AFP, similar departures include BP’s Bernard Looney in 2023 and McDonald’s Steve Easterbrook in 2019, who were both removed for failing to disclose relationships with colleagues.The company announced that Nespresso chief Philipp Navratil will take over the role.According to news agency AFP, Nestlé’s board launched an inquiry overseen by chairman Paul Bulcke and lead independent director Pablo Isla, supported by external counsel.“The departure of Laurent Freixe follows an investigation into an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate which breached Nestlé's code of business conduct,” the board said in a statement.Bulcke called the decision “necessary”, adding, “Nestlé's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service.”As per The Guardian, Freixe replaced Mark Schneider last year in a surprise switch, tasked with reviving sluggish consumer demand. Nestlé has faced challenges, including falling profits and weak spending in China, while also passing on higher raw material costs to shoppers.The company’s shares dropped nearly a quarter in 2024 but closed slightly higher on Monday at 75.49 Swiss francs.Navratil, who began his career with Nestlé in 2001, rose through senior roles in Central America and Mexico before leading the Nescafé and Starbucks brands globally. He became Nespresso CEO in 2024 and joined the executive board in January 2025.According to Axios, the board praised him for “achieving results in challenging environments” and said he would “accelerate efficiency efforts” without altering Nestlé’s current strategy.","Laurent Freixe, who joined the firm in 1986, had only been promoted to CEO in September 2024 after leading its Latin America division.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Santander UK plans to close 95 branches cutting 750 jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/santander-uk-plans-to-close-95-branches-cutting-750-jobs/articleshow/119206489.cms,"Photo- AP



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Santander UK's announcement on Wednesday that it plans to shut a fifth of its branch network has raised concerns about the bank's future in the UK. The move, which could result in around 750 job losses consist of the closure of 95 out of 444 branches by June.The bank which has faced speculation over its long-term presence in the UK, will retain 349 branches, including 290 full-service locations and 36 branches with reduced hours. Like many other UK banks, Santander has been scaling back its physical presence as customers increasingly turn to digital banking, reported news agency Reuters.Since 2019, the bank has reported a 63% rise in digital transactions, while in-branch financial transactions have declined by 61% over the same period. Despite this, the closures have sparked criticism from UK lawmakers, who argue that they harm local businesses and make it more difficult for vulnerable customers in rural areas to access banking services.In response to these concerns, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced new rules in September to make it more difficult for banks to close branches without ensuring that customers have free access to cash alternatives.Santander UK explained that the decision to close branches was part of its strategy to align with customer behaviour. ""As a business, we must move with customers and balance our investment across all the places where we interact with them,"" said the bank. ""Closing a branch is always a very difficult decision, and we spend a great deal of time assessing where and when we do this and how to minimize the impact on our customers.""The bank added that it is consulting with employee unions and will provide support to affected staff, including assistance with finding alternative roles within the bank.In its most recent financial report, Santander UK posted a 38% drop in annual pre-tax profit, totalling £1.33 billion ($1.73 billion) in 2024. The bank employs approximately 18,000 people.Despite reports in January suggesting that Barclays had explored a potential offer for Santander UK's operations, the parent company reiterated last month that its UK unit remains a key part of its globally diversified business strategy and is not for sale.",Santander UK plans to shut a fifth of its branch network by June.

"Gratuity eligibility, payout and formula: Leaving job before 5 years? Here’s how you can still get gratuity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/savings/gratuity-eligibility-payout-and-formula-leaving-job-before-5-years-heres-how-you-can-still-get-gratuity/articleshow/119248440.cms,"Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the Payment of Gratuity Act. (AI image)

How is gratuity payment calculated? Formula explained

The calculation method is: (15X Final drawn salary X Service duration)/26

The computation would be: (15X40,000X5)/26.

The gratuity amount due to Mis X is Rs 1,15,384.61, rounded to Rs 1,15,385.

For staff not under the Payment of Gratuity Act's purview:

The computation for his gratuity proceeds as: (15X40,000X6)/30.

The final gratuity amount that Mr X shall receive is Rs 1,20,000.

Salaried employees quite often have gratuity as a component of their CTC (cost to company). The Payment of Gratuity Rules, 1972, stipulates that staff members become entitled to gratuity after completing five years of uninterrupted service with an organisation. But, did you know that you can qualify for gratuity payout before completing five years, provided they serve beyond a particular duration.According to an ET report, experts say that employees qualify for gratuity upon completing 4 years and 240 days with an organisation. For example, if someone began working at an organisation on January 1, 2021, they would be eligible for gratuity upon leaving after August 29, 2025. This eligibility occurs because they would have served 4 years and 240 days by then, although their five-year milestone would only be completed by January 1, 2026.This provision exists because of how continuous service is defined in the Payment of Gratuity Act Puneet Gupta, Tax Partner, EY India, told ET, ""Section 4(1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act says that gratuity will be payable if an employee has rendered a minimum continuous service of five years. Section 2A of the Payment of Gratuity Act defines continuous service. Section 2A(2) of the Gratuity Act defines the deemed-to-be in continuous service. An employee is deemed to be in continuous service for one year if an employee during the 12 preceding calendar months has worked under the employer for not less than 190 days or 240 days, as the case may be.""Also Read | Tax planning before March 31 deadline? Tax saving fixed deposits with high interest rates - check list According to the Payment of Gratuity Act, employees working in underground mines or establishments operating fewer than six days weekly must complete 190 days, whilst others need 240 days. When an employee completes more than 240 days in the fifth year, they are considered to have completed an additional year of service, totalling five years, thus becoming eligible for gratuity.Saraswathi Kasturirangan, Partner at Deloitte India explains that an employee on payroll becomes eligible for gratuity payment upon completing 4 years and 240 days of service when leaving the organisation. The 240-day period is equivalent to 7.89 months. Therefore, workers should ensure their tenure extends to 4 years and 8 months to qualify for gratuity benefits upon resignation or retirement, she says. Consequently, staff members whose continuous service falls short of 4 years and 240 days, for instance, those departing after 4 years and 6 months or 4 years, 6 months and 1 day, cannot claim gratuity benefits, she notes.The requirement of five years' continuous service is waived if the employee's service ends due to death or disablement.Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the Payment of Gratuity Act. The calculation method varies depending on whether employees fall under the Act's purview or not.Also Read | Gold prices at record high! Have yellow metal prices peaked? Check these 5 charts before putting more money in gold The Act's applicability is determined by the organisation's workforce size. If an organisation has employed 10 or more people on any single day within the previous 12 calendar months, it comes under the Act's jurisdiction. Once covered, the organisation remains subject to the Act even if staff numbers subsequently decrease below 10.For staff members covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act, the payment is calculated using 15 days of their final drawn salary for each full year of service, including any period exceeding six months.The final drawn salary encompasses basic pay, dearness allowance and sales commission, as stipulated in the Act.Consider Miss X who has served an organisation (with a six-day work week) for 4 years and 300 days. Her eligibility for gratuity payment is confirmed as her service exceeds 4 years and 240 days. With a final basic salary of Rs 40,000, the 300 days convert to 9.863 months. For gratuity calculations, when excess months exceed 6 (9 months here), it counts as one complete year.Also Read | New TDS rules from April 1, 2025: Check new tax deduction limits for FD interest, MFs and lottery wins Gratuity remains payable even when organisations aren't covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act. In such instances, the gratuity is calculated as half a month's salary per completed service year, disregarding any incomplete year (months less than a year) in the calculation.The gratuity calculation follows this equation: (15 X Last drawn salary X Number of years of completed service)/30.Consider a scenario where Mr X has served an organisation (not under the Act's purview) for 6 years and 7 months. His final basic salary stands at Rs 40,000, and the organisation opts to provide him with gratuity.","Salaried employees often have gratuity as a component of their CTC (cost to company) The Payment of Gratuity Rules, 1972, stipulates that staff members become entitled to gratuity after completing five years of uninterrupted service with an organisation.

Strong trade momentum for India in December quarter: Unctad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/strong-trade-momentum-for-india-in-december-quarter-unctad/articleshow/119390868.cms,"Representational photo

NEW DELHI: India has seen strong goods and services trade momentum in the Dec quarter, a report by UN body Unctad has said but cautioned that global trade could be hit by the policy shifts in the US and trade and geopolitical tensions.Besides, it has pointed to high duties faced by developing countries, limiting market access for their goods. The agency's latest Global Trade Update said that exports from South Asia face among the highest tariffs, averaging around 4%, while imports to the region and Africa see the highest average levy of around 8%.It, however, pointed out that despite having lower tariffs in general, developed countries maintain ""tariff peaks"" with duties as high as over 100% for several farm goods. In general, South Asia topped the list on this count too.The report said developing countries maintained higher duties on imports to support nascent industries, and also have more elbow room during trade negotiations. For some countries, it was also a revenue instrument, with taxes on international trade generating 10-30% of govt revenue.Unctad said when it came to goods trade, India and China saw strong momentum in the Dec quarter, reporting growths of 7% and 5%, respectively. ""Developing nations, particularly China and India, saw better than average trade expansion, while many developed nations experienced trade contractions,"" it said.India's export of goods and services grew 6.3% in 2024 (calendar year) as against global annual trade growth of 3.7%. India's exports of goods and services rose to $ 817.4 billion in 2024, compared with $769 billion in 2023.South Africa saw a 13% jump in services exports, while India grew 3% during the Dec quarter.It also highlighted India's high trade deficit, especially with China and Russia, which were among the highest for bilateral trade. During 2024, the US had the highest trade deficit with China ($355 billion), followed by that with the European Union ($241 billion). India's trade deficit of $103 billion with China was seventh among bilateral trading partners, followed by the $65 billion with Russia at number 12.In recent years, India's exports to China have declined, widening the trade deficit, while the gap with Russia has increased on account of large quantities of crude petroleum being shipped into the country as oil companies seek a bargain and export finished products to other parts of the world in the wake of sanctions against Moscow.","India has seen strong goods and services trade momentum in the Dec quarter.

"Zepto eyes pie of larger, 'planned' grocery orders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/zepto-eyes-pie-of-larger-planned-grocery-orders/articleshow/119390863.cms,"BENGALURU: Some quick commerce (10-minute delivery) players are now testing the waters in planned grocery purchases that the likes of BigBasket had pioneered. This shift is aimed at capturing household bulk buying. However, a note from HSBC, says the move comes with trade-offs, particularly in terms of profitability.New value-focused programmes such as Zepto's Super-Saver, offer deep discounts, but require higher minimum order values - often more than double the usual average order value. While this strategy drives larger basket sizes, HSBC analysts note that it also compresses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) margins, reducing them from around 6% to 3%.It added that market leader Blinkit remains a premium-priced convenience player, avoiding deep discounts in favour of expanding categories and geographical reach. Swiggy Instamart falls somewhere in between the two, with competitive pricing but without the same push into bulk purchases. Zomato's Blinkit does not have a loyalty programme like Zepto Pass or Swiggy One.Quick commerce thrives on high-frequency, low-ticket orders, serving as a supplement to modern retail rather than a replacement. Expanding into the value retail segment could reshape this dynamic. ""BigBasket's original model was this. Now you see even quick commerce looking this way. They are going behind DMart's target group, to beat the perception that quick commerce is priced on the higher side. Amazon India's original play in groceries had also taken this approach,"" Satish Meena, adviser at Datum Intelligence, told TOI.","Some quick commerce (10-minute delivery) players are now testing the waters in planned grocery purchases.

SC allows audit regulator's proceedings against CAs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sc-allows-audit-regulators-proceedings-against-cas/articleshow/119390926.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has allowed audit regulator National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) to continue its proceedings against chartered accountants and firms where no audit quality review reports have been prepared and final orders are yet to be passed.During a hearing in a case challenging an order passed by the Delhi HC, a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar has, however, asked NFRA not to issue final orders in these cases and also said that final orders that have already been passed will not be given effect. NFRA had moved the SC challenging and order by Delhi HC bench of Justices Yashwant Varma and Dharmesh Sharma, raised concerns over NFRA not constituting divisions to separate powers for audit quality review and disciplinary actions and had sought fresh evaluation in 11 cases.In the apex court, NFRA pleaded that the order is contrary to the ruling by NCLAT and SC in earlier cases. It has cited an SC judgment in the case of T K Harish , a branch auditor of DHFL, relating to siphoning off of Rs 31,000 crore of public money and a bank fraud of Rs 3,700 crore being investigated by other law enforcement agencies.In its appeal in the case involving Snehal N Muzoomdar, NFRA has argued that the auditor was an engagement partner of a branch auditor of DHFL and the Delhi HC order has resulted in an anomalous situation where the proceedings and order passed in the case of one branch auditor has been upheld by SC, while the proceedings and order passed in the case of an engagement partner of another branch auditor of the very same company have been quashed.","The Supreme Court has allowed audit regulator National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) to continue its proceedings against chartered accountants and firms.

Pay less on Amazon... E-tailer cuts seller fee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pay-less-on-amazon-e-tailer-cuts-seller-fee/articleshow/119390855.cms,"MUMBAI: Shopping on Amazon may cost less as the e-commerce giant is reducing a slew of seller fees, which is likely to translate into lower product pricing.Shoppers with smaller budgets stand to benefit the most as the company is doing away with referral fees or commission charged to sellers for products across a range of categories priced under Rs 300. Those selling on e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart have to pay a commission to the platforms for each product sold.Products within the Rs 300 price range make up for a large part of the consumption basket of households, said Amit Nanda, director, selling partner services at Amazon India. For the middle class, which has been bearing the brunt of high inflation, some reduction in prices can help them to spend a little more.""We did an experiment (on seller fees reduction) in Sep last year. That worked. We have just carried it and taken that to full scale. It will enable more businesses to come on Amazon, the current set of sellers to sell more and they can also choose to pass on some of the benefit to the customers,"" Nanda told TOI.Amazon has also slashed shipping fees (applies to all products) for all sellers bringing them down to Rs 65 (starting rate) from Rs 77, besides making some reduction in weight handling fees. The company expects that the changes which will come into effect from April 7 will boost the platform's seller network.Analysts said that the move is partly driven by increasing competition from quick commerce which has already taken a large share of the grocery market from e-commerce and has now expanded to other categories. ""The only way Amazon competes with quick commerce now is variety and pricing. By making changes in fees and offering more benefits to smaller sellers, it is trying to retain and widen its seller base for whom the quick commerce channel is becoming important,"" said Satish Meena, adviser at Datum Intelligence.Amazon has launched its own quick commerce service but it is restricted to parts of Bengaluru as of now and the firm has been late to join the rapid delivery rush, the market for which is led by Zomato's Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto.

Relief to telcos: Govt set to waive spectrum usage fee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/relief-to-telcos-govt-set-to-waive-spectrum-usage-fee/articleshow/119390874.cms,"Representational image

NEW DELHI: Govt is set to give a major relief to telecom companies - running into thousands of crores of rupees - by waiving off spectrum usage charges (SUC) on airwaves bought through auctions before Sept 2021.The measure will help companies, such as Vodafone Idea, Airtel and Reliance Jio conserve cash as they expand 5G services and continue the work to boost telecom network, an official source told TOI.In June 2022, govt had decided to remove SUC for bandwidth that had been auctioned after Sept 15, 2021 across different frequencies. However, no decision was taken for spectrum bought through auctions before this period.""The move to waive off SUC for spectrum bought through auctions before 2022 is likely to be approved soon. The plan is to give relief to the telecom companies so that their network expansion work continues strongly,"" the source said.It was felt that a competitive bidding process, which went aggressive on many occasions, had already helped the exchequer get the best prices for airwaves and thus there was no need to tax companies more for spectrum.Apart from SUC payout, which ranges around 3-4% of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of companies, telecom operators pay an 8% licence fee to govt, including 5% towards Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).""The matter has already been discussed within DoT and relevant ministries and an announcement on the waiver can come soon,"" the source said.One of the biggest beneficiaries of the move is likely to be Vodafone Idea, which is currently under a debt pile in excess of Rs 2 lakh crore. ""It is believed that the company may get a benefit of around Rs 8,000 crore,"" the source said.The waiver also comes at a time when the local companies prepare for entry of Elon Musk in the telecom sector through Starlink's Rs 2-lakh-crore venture. Interestingly, while local companies will see SUC obligations being waived off completely, Starlink will need to pay tax on its spectrum, the source said.""The reason for Starlink and other satellite operators being asked for SUC is that they will get the spectrum on an administrative basis instead of competitive auctions. The thinking is clear that any company getting spectrum through govt allocation at a pre-determined price will need to pay tax on the spectrum,"" the source said.","The measure will help companies, such as Vodafone Idea, Airtel and Reliance Jio conserve cash as they expand 5G services.

Eli Lilly launches weight-loss drug Mounjaro in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/ozempic-like-weight-loss-drug-mounjaro-launched-in-india-all-you-know-to-know/articleshow/119254961.cms,"Rising obesity and diabetes rates in India

PM Modi flags rising obesity in India

Global pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has launched Mounjaro ( tirzepatide ) in India. The drug, a single-molecule drug designed to bind to and activate both GIP and GLP-1 receptors, helps in regulating regulate blood sugar and metabolism. Approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), the once-weekly injectable drug offers a novel approach to metabolic health management, targeting both glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors.Mounjaro is indicated for adults with type 2 diabetes as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control. It is also prescribed for chronic weight management in individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obesity) or 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) with at least one weight-related condition.Winselow Tucker, President and General Manager of Eli Lilly India, described the dual burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes as a pressing public health challenge in India. ""Lilly is committed to working with the government and industry to increase awareness and improve disease management,"" he said, as reported by news agency PTI.In the SURMOUNT-1 trial, participants taking the highest dose (15 mg) lost an average of 21.8 kg over 72 weeks, while those on the lowest dose (5 mg) lost 15.4 kg, ANI reported. The placebo group, in comparison, lost just 3.2 kg. Similarly, the SURPASS program showed a reduction in A1C levels by up to 2.4%, making it a promising treatment option for diabetes management.Mounjaro is available in India in single-dose vials, with pricing starting at Rs 3,500 for a 2.5 mg vial and Rs 4,375 for a 5 mg vial. Monthly treatment costs range between Rs 14,000 and Rs 17,500, depending on the dosage.Mounjaro’s launch follows the success of other GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Ozempic (semaglutide), which has gained global recognition for its effectiveness in diabetes and weight management. Ozempic, marketed by Novo Nordisk, works similarly by mimicking hormones that regulate appetite and glucose levels.Recent studies have also suggested that semaglutide may reduce alcohol cravings, a finding that has sparked interest in its potential use beyond weight loss and diabetes treatment. Researchers found that people taking semaglutide consumed nearly 30% less alcohol compared to those on a placebo, reinforcing the idea that GLP-1-based drugs may help manage addiction-related behaviors.India is facing a growing epidemic of diabetes and obesity. Around 101 million Indians live with diabetes, and nearly half struggle with inadequate glycemic control. Meanwhile, obesity affects approximately 100 million adults and is linked to over 200 health complications, including heart disease, hypertension, and sleep apnea.In February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his Mann Ki Baat address, highlighted the growing obesity issue in India, adding that one in every eight people is affected.He urged citizens to reduce their edible oil consumption by 10% monthly to combat obesity, a message he reinforced during his radio address on Sunday.He also shared inspiring messages from Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra, boxer Nikhat Zareen, and renowned cardiac surgeon Dr Devi Shetty, who supported the initiative by sharing personal experiences.Additionally, the Prime Minister nominated several public figures, including business tycoons and celebrities, to spread awareness and extend the challenge to others.","Mounjaro is a single-molecule drug designed to bind to and activate both GIP and GLP-1 receptors.

Germany Travel Warnings: Why UK and Germany issued fresh travel advisory for those travelling to US?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/why-uk-and-germany-issued-fresh-travel-advisory-for-those-travelling-to-us/articleshow/119287510.cms,"Why UK-Germany issued these warnings?



The United Kingdom and Germany updated their travel advisories for the United States, warning citizens of strict enforcement of immigration rules after multiple cases of detentions at US entry points.The move comes after three German nationals were denied entry and placed in detention, and reports of a British citizen facing a similar situation.The UK foreign office issued its updated advisory on Thursday, cautioning British passport holders about the harsh consequences of violating US immigration laws. ""The authorities in the US set and enforce entry rules strictly,"" the advisory stated. ""You may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules.""The updated guidance now explicitly urges travellers to ""comply with all entry, visa and other conditions of entry.""According to Reuters, the UK Foreign Office had earlier confirmed support for a British national detained in the US, following reports of a woman being held at the border.Germany also revised its travel guidance this week after three of its citizens were detained when attempting to enter the US. ""A criminal conviction in the United States, false information regarding the purpose of stay, or even a slight overstay of the visa upon entry or exit can lead to arrest, detention, and deportation,"" Germany’s Foreign Ministry stated.The ministry clarified that possessing an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) or a US visa does not guarantee entry, as US border authorities have the final say. ""The final decision on whether a person can enter the United States rests with the American border authorities. But this is no surprise; it is the same in Germany,"" a ministry spokesperson told Der Spiegel.The advisories come amid increasing reports of European nationals being denied entry and detained at US airports and border crossings. The Trump administration’s intensified crackdown on immigration has raised concerns among allied nations, as even visa holders and legal residents have faced difficulties entering the country.Among those affected is Fabian Schmidt, a 34-year-old German green card holder who was detained in Boston and later transferred to a facility in Rhode Island. His mother, Astrid Senior, alleged in an interview that he was ""violently interrogated"", stripped naked, and forced into a cold shower by two officials.Two other German nationals, Jessica Brösche, 29, and Lucas Sielaff, 25, were also detained and later deported. Brösche, who attempted to enter the US from Tijuana, Mexico, was held at Otay Mesa Detention Center for over six weeks. Friends claim she was placed in solitary confinement for nine days, though San Diego CoreCivic, which operates the facility, denied the allegation.Sielaff, who entered the US on a tourist visa and later visited Mexico, was detained for two weeks before being sent back to Germany, his girlfriend told Tages-Anzeiger.Germany's foreign ministry emphasised that the revised guidance does not constitute an official travel warning but serves to inform travellers of stricter enforcement measures.Travellers from both countries are advised to consult their respective foreign offices and verify entry conditions before visiting the US.","UK and Germany update travel advisories for the United States.

The price of Brexit: How much is leaving the EU costing UK businesses?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-price-of-brexit-how-much-is-leaving-the-eu-costing-uk-businesses/articleshow/119371467.cms,"Representative image

The UK is paying a heavy financial price for Brexit, with new data revealing a significant blow to trade with the European Union . As a result, the government has announced plans to eliminate obstacles hampering trade in an effort to mitigate the economic damage.As per recent figures—official estimates show that Brexit is costing UK businesses £37 billion annually due to reduced trade with the EU, according to report by UK newspaper Independent. According to data presented by UK trade minister Douglas Alexander, UK-EU trade for the period ending September last year was 5 per cent lower than in 2018, when adjusted for inflation and excluding precious metals. This figure comes from calculations by the House of Commons library.Alexander put the blame on the previous Conservative government's Brexit agreement for the substantial losses, declaring that it is ""clear [the agreement] is not working well enough."" He outlined the Labour government's commitment to rebuilding economic ties with the EU and removing unnecessary trade barriers to stimulate growth.The financial loss was highlighted during a parliamentary question from SNP MP Stephen Gethins, who described it as ""an appalling loss of trade at a time when business and the Exchequer can ill afford it."" Gethins criticized the government's ongoing adherence to a ""hard Tory Brexit,"" arguing that it worsens economic conditions while imposing cuts that harm the most vulnerable. ""A hard Brexit makes us poorer and less secure,"" Gethins warned. ""The government must stop punching down on the most vulnerable to balance the books and join the customs union and single market at the very least.""The burden of post-Brexit bureaucracy has also been substantial. The Independent recently reported that Brexit-related paperwork is so extensive it could circle the globe 15 times. David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, directly linked the trade decline to Brexit and urged the government to address regulatory differences that are causing friction.Mike Galsworthy of European Movement UK questioned the rationale for excluding the single market, customs union, and free movement, arguing these were not mandated by the 2016 referendum. Meanwhile, Tom Brufatto from Best for Britain suggested that closer alignment with the EU could increase the UK economy by 2.2 per cent, and called for policies to reduce trade friction ahead of the upcoming UK-EU summit in May.","UK-EU trade for the period ending September last year was 5 per cent lower than in 2018, when adjusted for inflation and excluding precious metals.

Driving the news

Why it matters

India’s dilemma:

China’s overflow problem:

New ‘China Shock’

: India, others in crosshairs

Trump’s trade war is also fueling a second wave of the “China Shock,” a term used by economists to describe the massive economic disruption caused by China’s rise as a manufacturing powerhouse in the early 2000s. Now, as Trump closes the door on Chinese imports, those products are flooding global markets—leading to economic distress in countries from Indonesia to Mexico.

India in the crosshairs: India is feeling the heat. Authorities in New Delhi have launched anti-dumping probes into a range of Chinese products, including solar cells and mobile phone components, to shield domestic industries. Meanwhile, local textile producers are struggling to compete against a flood of inexpensive Chinese garments.

India is feeling the heat. Authorities in New Delhi have launched anti-dumping probes into a range of Chinese products, including solar cells and mobile phone components, to shield domestic industries. Meanwhile, local textile producers are struggling to compete against a flood of inexpensive Chinese garments. The situation in India mirrors what is happening in Mexico and Southeast Asia. As per the Bloomberg report, in Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum has linked rising violence in industrial regions to mass layoffs caused by the influx of Chinese goods. “So much of the entry of Chinese products into Mexico caused this industry to fall in our country,” Sheinbaum said.

Indonesia's textile and apparel industry has shed around 250,000 jobs over the past two years, with an additional 500,000 positions projected to be at risk by 2025. This trend would amount to losing roughly one in four industry jobs within just a few years. The pace of these job losses surpasses the so-called ""China Shock,"" during which the US lost as many as 2.4 million jobs between 1999 and 2011.

Thailand has imposed a value-added tax on low-cost Chinese imports. Sanan Angubolkul, the head of Thailand’s Chamber of Commerce, warned that the situation is “very critical, and there’s no time to waste” as the nation deals with a surge of electrical appliances, clothing and other Chinese goods, the Bloomberg report said .

Vietnam has ordered Chinese e-commerce giants to suspend operations.

In Indonesia, garment manufacturers are struggling to compete with cheap Chinese textiles. The Indonesia Fiber and Filament Yarn Producer Association estimates that one in four jobs in the sector could disappear this year.

What they’re saying

Trump’s latest trade moves have sparked strong reactions from business leaders, economists, and government officials:

Donald Trump, on trade negotiations: “We have a powerful group of partners in trade. Again, we can’t let those partners treat us badly… The ones that wouldn’t be as friendly to us in some cases treat us better than the ones that are supposed to be friendly.”

Howard Lutnick, US commerce Ssecretary: “These policies are the most important thing America has ever had… It is worth it.”

Henrietta Treyz, economic analyst: “Markets remain skittish because this isn’t just about China anymore. Trump’s April 2 tariffs will hit everyone.”

Brian Coulton, Fitch chief economist: “Tariff hikes will result in higher US consumer prices, reduce real wages, and increase companies’ costs.”

""This is China Shock 2.0 or China Shock 3.0. China has this immense manufacturing capacity, and the goods have to go somewhere"" Gordon Hanson, a professor of urban policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, told Bloomberg.

Zoom In: India’s trade battle

India, which is both a competitor and a partner to China, faces unique challenges in this trade war:

The country’s automotive, chemical, and electronics sectors have benefited from Trump’s tariffs on China, as US firms seek alternative suppliers.

However, India also imports heavily from China, meaning that any trade barriers on Chinese goods could raise costs for Indian manufacturers.

Trump’s demand for reciprocal tariffs puts India in a difficult position. If India refuses, it risks losing access to the lucrative US market. But if it complies, domestic industries—especially agriculture and small businesses—could suffer.

What’s next

As the April 2 tariff deadline approaches, several key developments could shape the outcome:

India’s concessions: The Modi government is in talks to lower more tariffs, but it remains unclear if these moves will be enough to satisfy Trump.

China’s retaliation: If China feels further cornered, it could step up its trade offensive, worsening the economic fallout for other countries.

Global recession fears: Economists warn that escalating trade tensions could push the world closer to a recession, with inflation rising and investment slowing.

The bottom line

US President Donald Trump is escalating his global trade war, targeting not just China but also allies like India. As part of his ""America First"" economic strategy, Trump announced that India will face reciprocal tariffs starting April 2, claiming that the country imposes some of the highest duties on US goods.Meanwhile, his crackdown on Beijing is triggering a new ""China Shock,"" as excess Chinese exports flood global markets, disrupting industries and destroying jobs worldwide, a Bloomberg report said. The world’s largest exporter, facing increased trade barriers in the US, is flooding other markets with cheap goods—undercutting local manufacturers and eliminating jobs from Mexico to Indonesia to India.In an interview with Breitbart News, Trump said that while India is a “wonderful nation,” it has tariffs that are unfair to the US. “I have a very good relationship with India, but the only problem I have is they’re one of the highest tariffing nations in the world,” he said. “I believe they’re going to probably be lowering those tariffs substantially, but on April 2, we will be charging them the same tariffs they charge us.”On China, Trump is taking an even more aggressive stance, arguing that Beijing’s economic expansion is hurting American workers and destabilizing industries worldwide. His latest tariffs are designed to curb China’s influence, but they are also causing widespread disruptions in other economies that rely on trade with China.The economic fallout is already visible in Southeast Asia, where Chinese exports—redirected from the US due to tariffs—are undercutting local businesses.Trump’s tariff war is not just a US-China showdown—it’s reshaping global trade patterns, forcing countries like India to make tough choices and wreaking havoc on emerging markets:While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cultivated strong ties with Trump, India is scrambling to reduce trade tensions. In recent weeks, it has lowered duties on bourbon, high-end motorcycles, and certain agricultural goods. More tariff reductions could follow as Indian officials work to avoid a full-scale trade war with the US.With US import barriers rising, Chinese manufacturers are aggressively seeking new markets. The result? An oversupply of Chinese goods in countries like Indonesia, Mexico, and Brazil, putting pressure on local producers.A global economic risk: Trump’s tariffs have already rattled markets. As April 2 approaches, uncertainty is growing, with investors worried about inflation and supply chain disruptions. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently noted, “Uncertainty is remarkably high.”Trump’s tariff war is reshaping the global economic order. India is trying to navigate a delicate balance, China is flooding markets with cheap goods, and developing nations are facing a fresh wave of job losses. With April 2 looming, the world is watching to see whether Trump’s hardball tactics will succeed—or whether they will trigger an even bigger economic crisis.(With inputs from agencies)","Trump’s trade war is fueling a second wave of the “China Shock,” a term used by economists to describe the massive economic disruption caused by China's rise as a manufacturing powerhouse in the early 2000s.

Ben & Jerry’s argued this decision violated the terms of its merger agreement, which requires consultation with an advisory committee from its board before any CEO can be removed.Unilever, headquartered in London, responded on Wednesday, expressing disappointment over the public nature of the dispute.“Regrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public,” the company said in a statement.Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry’s in 2000 for $326 million, with the ice cream brand hoping the partnership would strengthen its social mission. However, tensions between the two companies have escalated in recent years.In 2021, Ben & Jerry’s announced it would no longer sell its products in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The following year, Unilever sold its Israeli operations to a local company, which continued selling Ben & Jerry’s under its Hebrew and Arabic branding across Israel and the West Bank.Unilever has since revealed plans to spin off its entire ice cream division, including Ben & Jerry’s, by the end of 2025 as part of a wider restructuring. The consumer goods giant also owns brands such as Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.The strained relationship took another hit last November when Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever in a New York federal court, accusing it of attempting to silence the company’s statements supporting Palestinians in the Gaza war.The complaint also alleged that Unilever blocked Ben & Jerry’s from posting about issues it expected to be challenged in a potential second term for Donald Trump, including minimum wage policies, universal healthcare, abortion rights, and climate change.Tuesday’s filing marked an amendment to that ongoing lawsuit, further expanding the gap between the ice cream brand and its parent company.","Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry’s in 2000 for $326 million, with the ice cream brand hoping the partnership would strengthen its social mission.

MUMBAI: India remains the most cost-effective destination for remittances, yet recipients still lose around 5% of the money sent by relatives abroad in transfer costs.According to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) study, the global average cost of sending $200 has fallen (from nearly 9.7% in 2009 to around 6.7% in Q2 2024) but remains above the G20's 5% target and the UN's 3% Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). These costs include fees and exchange-rate markups.India has, however, met the G20 target. Remittance costs were 4.9% in 2023, and just over 5% in the first half of 2024 - below the global average. India is the top recipient, followed by Mexico, China, the Philippines, France, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.Digital remittances, which were 30% of transactions in Q2 2024, are cheaper. India's digital transfers averaged 4%, a percentage point below the national average, ""reflecting the rising role of digitalisation in optimising remittance costs"".Smaller transfers are pricier. Remittances under $200 averaged 4.6%, while $200-$500 transfers were 2.4%. Fintech firms and money-transfer operators (MTOs) offer the lowest costs, increasing competition.Advanced economies (AEs) now account for over half of India's $118 billion in FY24 remittances, while Gulf states make up 38%.","India remains the most cost-effective destination for remittances.

Microsoft Corp, the biggest backer of Sam Altman's OpenAI , and BlackRock Inc, which has an executive on the artificial intelligence startup's board, are joining forces with one of his chief rivals.Microsoft and BlackRock said on Wednesday that Elon Musk's xAI is joining their effort to build $30 billion worth of data centers and other artificial intelligence infrastructure. The AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp, which was already named as a technical adviser to the group when it was announced last year, is also formally joining, according to a statement that didn't detail member commitments.Microsoft, which has invested about $13 billion in OpenAI, has increasingly been developing AI outside of that partnership. The software giant has created in-house AI models that it believes can compete with OpenAI, Bloomberg reported this month. Musk, also a co-founder of OpenAI, has meanwhile publicly feuded with Altman over the company's efforts to shift to a for-profit structure.The capital demands and enthusiasm for AI have prompted a range of companies and investors to forge alliances to build some of the biggest data centre campuses in the world. US President Donald Trump has touted hundreds of billions of dollars worth of commitments from firms including Softbank Group and OpenAI, which are behind a $100 billion AI investment plan dubbed Stargate.The Microsoft-backed group will be renamed the AI Infrastructure Partnership , or AIP, and focus on infrastructure investments - including energy projects - mostly in the US, with a portion of the funds to be deployed in partner countries, according to the companies. The plan foresees bringing on additional investors. Clients, including pensions and insurers, are eager for such long-term infrastructure projects, BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink said in the statement.BlackRock and Microsoft last year unveiled the coalition in partnership with MGX, a UAE investment vehicle that is also involved in Stargate, and Bayo Ogunlesi's Global Infrastructure Partners.

Impact of tariffs and economic policies

Adjusting bond holdings to stabilise markets

Inflation and consumer sentiment

Slower growth ahead



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





The federal reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, keeping it unchanged for the second consecutive meeting, while signalling that it still expects to cut rates twice before the end of the year. However, officials acknowledged growing uncertainty in the economic outlook as inflation shows signs of persistence and growth projections weaken.In its latest quarterly economic forecast, the Fed revised its expectations for economic growth, predicting a slower expansion this year and next compared to previous estimates. The central bank also anticipates a slight increase in the unemployment rate, projecting it to rise to 4.4% by the end of 2025. Inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% target, is expected to climb to 2.7% this year from its current level of 2.5%.""Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,"" Fed noted in its post-meeting statement, highlighting the delicate balance policymakers must strike. While rising inflation would typically prompt the Fed to keep rates elevated or even raise them, slowing growth and rising unemployment could necessitate rate cuts to support the economy.The decision to hold rates steady comes as the central bank assesses the broader impact of the Trump administration's economic policies, particularly tariffs. Economists predict that new trade barriers could temporarily push inflation higher, while other measures, such as deregulation, may offset some of those effects by reducing costs.Fed chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that tariffs have begun to influence inflation, particularly through higher costs on imported goods.""I do think with the arrival of tariff inflation, further progress [on lowering inflation] is probably delayed,"" Powell said during a news conference.Alongside the rate decision, Fed announced a slowdown in the pace at which it is reducing its holdings of US treasury securities.Previously, the central bank allowed $25 billion in treasuries to mature each month without reinvesting the proceeds. Now, it will reinvest more aggressively, limiting the monthly runoff to just $5 billion.This move aims to keep long-term borrowing costs lower by stabilizing Treasury yields, which dipped slightly following the announcement.Despite Fed's efforts to manage inflation, concerns are growing among economists and consumers alike. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that inflation could climb to 3% by the end of the year, up from 2.6% currently, largely driven by import taxes.Consumer sentiment also reflects growing caution, with recent surveys indicating that Americans expect inflation to worsen. If these expectations persist, they could lead to self-fulfilling price increases as people rush to make purchases before costs rise further. Retailers and homebuilders have already signalled potential price hikes on goods and services due to the added pressure of tariffs.While inflation remains a key concern, signs of economic slowdown are also emerging. The economy has shown weaker growth in early 2025, with Barclays cutting its GDP forecast to just 0.7%, down from an earlier projection of 2.5% in 2024.With inflation still above target, growth slowing, and tariffs complicating the economic landscape, the Fed's path forward remains uncertain. Policymakers have signalled rate cuts on the horizon, but the timing and extent of those reductions will depend on how economic conditions evolve in the coming months.","The federal reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, keeping it unchanged for the second consecutive meeting. Officials acknowledged growing uncertainty in the economic outlook as inflation shows signs of persistence and growth projections weaken. Inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% target, is expected to climb to 2.7% this year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119225426,imgsize-1139658,width-400,resizemode-4/119225426.jpg"

The US Federal Reserve kept the benchmark rate unchanged in the 4.25-4.5% range in its meeting today. ""In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,"" the statement read.""Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate,"" the FOMC statement read.Federal Reserve officials maintained their projection of two interest rate reductions in 2025, whilst revising their growth estimates downwards for 2025 and increasing their inflation predictions.The US central bank officials suggested they continue to expect a reduction in borrowing costs by 50 basis points before year-end, considering the anticipated economic slowdown and eventual decline in inflation rates.The Fed's outlook for inflation saw an upward revision, with their preferred price increase measure projected to reach 2.7% by year-end, compared to the previously forecasted 2.5% in December. The Federal Reserve maintains an inflation target of 2%.Additionally, they reduced the US GDP growth forecast for the current year from 2.1% to 1.7%, alongside predictions of a marginally higher unemployment rate by the end of this year.""In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments,"" the statement added.Most market analysts expected the Federal Reserve to maintain its current interest rate whilst monitoring economic developments. The job market appears stable, following robust economic performance at the end of last year.There is considerable ambiguity regarding the economic impact of US President Donald Trump's policies. His stated objectives include revitalising domestic manufacturing and reducing federal workforce numbers.The constant stream of policy declarations from Trump regarding tariffs and other measures has generated significant economic uncertainty. Economists are concerned this might lead American businesses and consumers to reduce their expenditure.Should economic conditions deteriorate, the Federal Reserve maintains the option to stimulate growth through interest rate reductions, as demonstrated in previous economic downturns. With the primary interest rate currently ranging between 4.25% and 4.50%, there remains substantial scope for adjustment.Also Read | Is a US recession coming? 7 charts that show the plight of the American economy However, as pointed out in an Associated Press report, the US Federal Reserve faces a more complex scenario in its current decision-making process. Whilst reducing interest rates would stimulate the economy, it could simultaneously drive inflation higher, particularly concerning given the existing tariff-related inflationary pressures.The Fed lacks effective mechanisms to address ""stagflation,"" a situation characterised by economic stagnation coupled with persistent high inflation, the report notes.Interest rate reductions, previously viewed as positive responses to inflation approaching the Fed's 2% target, might now be perceived negatively. These cuts could become necessary to counteract economic challenges stemming from widespread tariffs, substantial reductions in government expenditure, and heightened economic uncertainty.Also Read | Trump tariffs impact: Is a US recession likely and does India need to worry about it?

XRP saw a surge after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is no longer pursuing its appeal in the ongoing legal case against the payments company. As a result, XRP's price jumped nearly 11%, reaching $2.52.Speaking at the Digital Assets Summit in New York on Wednesday morning, Garlinghouse reflected on the nearly four-year-long legal battle, according to CNBC.""It’s been almost four years and about three months since the SEC originally sued us, certainly a painful journey in lots of ways,"" he said. ""I really deeply believed that we were going to be on the right side of the law and on the right side of history.""Garlinghouse criticized the SEC, stating, ""The system just feels broken. That we had to fight this fight for the industry and you had an SEC attacking the industry, particularly the Ripple case. There were no victims, there was no investor loss. They were just not acting in good faith.""In 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, accusing the company of violating US securities laws by selling XRP without registering it. Ripple achieved a partial victory in 2023 when US District Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of the company, a decision celebrated as a landmark for the crypto industry .While XRP was not deemed a security when sold to retail investors on exchanges, it was considered an unregistered security offering when sold to institutional investors.This development comes as the SEC moves swiftly to address its previous administration's actions, which had a significant impact on the crypto industry.Last month, the SEC ended its enforcement case against Coinbase, closed investigations into Robinhood's crypto unit, Uniswap, Gemini, and ConsenSys without taking enforcement action, scaled back its crypto enforcement unit, and clarified that meme coins are not considered securities. Additionally, the SEC's newly formed crypto task force is launching a roundtable series to discuss and define the security status of digital assets.XRP, created by Ripple's founders in 2012, is the native token of the XRP Ledger , which Ripple uses for cross-border payments. Approximately 95% of Ripple's business takes place outside the US, and the company is the largest holder of XRP. The token has seen a tremendous rise, up more than 390% since the postelection Trump trade, and has gained 20% in value this year.","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the SEC is no longer pursuing its appeal in the ongoing legal case against the payments company.

The EU will reduce steel imports by a further 15 percent from April, the bloc's industry chief said Wednesday, to prevent a wave of cheap steel flooding the market after the United States imposed new levies.US President Donald Trump slapped 25-percent tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium, raising fears of the knock-on effects for Europe's beleaguered steel industry, already facing fierce competition from Asia and high energy prices.""On April 1, we will reinforce the current safeguard clause. We're aiming for a drop of up to 15 percent in imports,"" European Commission vice president Stephane Sejourne said as he unveiled a medley of measures to protect the metals sector.The commission already has safeguard measures -- including import limits -- in place to protect the steel industry, that will continue until 2026.The European steel industry currently employs more than 300,000 people -- but has lost almost 100,000 jobs in the past 15 years.

Indian airline IndiGo announced plans on Wednesday to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030 in an effort to capture a larger market share.The no-frills carrier intends to raise its international capacity share—measured as the proportion of total available seat kilometres dedicated to international routes—from the current 28% to 40%, news agency Reuters reported. This shift marks a significant growth from just 14% in fiscal year 2018, achieved in a span of seven years.IndiGo currently flies to 40 international destinations and holds a 19% share of India’s international flight market, according to the latest data from the country’s aviation regulator. Following the announcement, shares of the airline rose by 4.2%.This international expansion comes as IndiGo seeks to diversify beyond its dominant domestic market, where it holds nearly 60% of the share. The move aligns with the broader trend of Indian carriers working to meet the growing demand for both domestic and international air travel, despite challenges related to aircraft supply.Earlier this year, IndiGo revealed plans to strengthen its international presence, which currently generates around 10% of its revenue. The airline also announced plans to lease a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Norse Atlantic Airways to expand its long-haul operations.IndiGo is looking to add business class seats to its Airbus A321XLR and A350 aircraft to further increase revenue, as business class tickets are priced roughly three times higher than economy class.The airline began offering business class seats on select domestic routes late last year, marking its first move away from an all-economy cabin model, and is positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for premium travel among Indian passengers.IndiGo also reaffirmed its goal of expanding its fleet to over 600 aircraft by 2030, up from approximately 437 currently.","Indian airline IndiGo plans to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030.

Google parent Alphabet agreed to acquire cloud security firm Wiz for $32 billion in cash, reaching a deal less than a year after initial negotiations fell apart because the cloud-computing startup wanted to stay independent.Wiz will join the Google Cloud business once the deal closes, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. The takeover is subject to regulatory approvals and is likely to close next year, they said.The deal, which would be Alphabet’s largest to date, comes after Wiz turned down a $23 billion bid from the internet search leader last year after several months of discussions. At the time, Wiz walked away after deciding it could ultimately be worth more by pursuing an initial public offering company. Concerns about regulatory challenges also influenced the decision.Shares of Alphabet fell nearly 3% in New York on Tuesday.The Wiz takeover is by far the largest M&A deal to be announced this year. Deal hungry companies and their advisers had initially predicted that US President Donald Trump’s policies would create better conditions for buying and selling, supercharging an M&A market that just got back on its feet after a lull. Instead, his tariff threats and geopolitical tensions have spooked markets and kept dealmakers in wait-and-see mode.Google framed the Wiz ac quisition as a way to beef up its cloud security offerings with new ways to keep their systems secure in a new era of Artificial Intelligence.“AI brings new risks, but also new opportunities,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a call with investors. “Organisations are looking for cybersecurity solutions that improve cloud security and span multiple clouds.”","Wiz will join the Google Cloud business once the deal closes, the companies said.

Is a US recession coming? 7 charts that show the plight of the American economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/is-a-us-recession-coming-7-charts-that-show-the-plight-of-the-american-economy/articleshow/119167257.cms,"Is the US economy headed for a downturn? (AI image)

“The trends indicate that the jump in US economy post COVID may have been an outlier as a result of policy extravaganza…. Long trends indicate possible downturn in US economy,” says SBI in its latest report.

US Real GDP growth in long run

Drastically cutting Federal spending can be disastrous, says SBI report

What US economic data is pointing to

1) GDP growth trajectory:

The US economy has weakened over the past year, with GDP growth declining from 3.2% in Q4 2023 to 2.5% in Q4 2024, notes the SBI report.

2) Debt:

The debt to GDP ratio shows a secular rising trend, says SBI.

3) Reduced exports, consumption:

Extended analysis suggests a probable decline in US economic growth, accompanied by reduced exports and consumption.

4) Savings to GDP ratio:

US Consumer Spending Drop

5) Stock market mayhem:

P/E multiples are stretched for most markets

US economy: What’s the long-term outlook?

The US economy long-term trends in GDP indicate decline in potential GDP, demand and investments

The US indebtedness has sharply increased over the years, crowding out the private sector

Although high debt has not reflected in US dollar, which shows cyclical trends its strength has over the years has declined

The current tariff policy will have short term pain and US GDP will not see acceleration in material way

The economic rational of US DOGE is evident from long-term term trends

If the structural adjustment gains traction, then potential GDP trend can see a upward shift. The larger national savings that come from exercise despite nominal improvement in productivity can still push the potential GDP up. The crowding in of the private sector that follows along with technical progress can add significantly to growth prospects. However, this adjustment will have short term costs.

Is the US economy headed for a recession? A recession happens when an economy’s GDP contracts for two consecutive quarters. A recent SBI Research report says that the long term US GDP growth shows a declining trend.Concerns have risen about the economic outlook of the US post Trump’s tariff measures and cutting of spending and jobs. Economists view Trump's trade conflict as a potential threat to the American economy, with possible consequences of increased consumer costs, reduced economic growth and diminished employment opportunities.The report also cautions that, “the zealotry mission of departments like DOGE can undo a lot of ground works done in the previous decades, putting downward pressure on the beleaguered economy.” DOGE or the Department of Government Efficiency is an initiative of the US President Donald Trump and is headed by Tesla CEO and Trump advisor Elon Musk.The economic uncertainty looms large, particularly noteworthy as it follows a period when the US economy demonstrated remarkable strength whilst managing the COVID pandemic crisis. So is the US economy headed for a recession? We take a look at some important data pointers in the SBI report on and the expected trends in the US economy based on long-term history:Analysis of US GDP growth reveals a downward trajectory, particularly evident since 2000, says the SBI report. America’s economic indicators suggest a reduction in potential GDP, alongside weakening demand and investment patterns.“The GDP Now model estimate from Atlanta Fed for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate, running estimate) in the first quarter of 2025 is -2.4% on 06 Mar, down from +2.9% on 31 Jan (first estimate),” says the report.Rising national debt levels have become increasingly significant, resulting in diminished private sector participation. Current trade policies involving tariffs are expected to create immediate challenges, without substantial improvement in GDP performance.Post-COVID US economic growth appears exceptional, attributed to extensive policy measures.Total factor productivity growth is diminishing, while value addition shows negative progression. Elevated wage levels might deter future investments. The savings-to-GDP ratio has reached its lowest point since 2011, marking the second-lowest figure since 1951.January witnessed the first decline in consumer spending in nearly 24 months, whilst the goods trade deficit reached unprecedented levels due to businesses accelerating imports to avoid tariff implications, suggesting possible economic contraction this quarter. Consumer expenditure trends are expected to weaken in correlation with the projected overall GDP slowdown.The S&P 500 has given up its post-November election gains, with March 2025 projected to record the poorest monthly performance since the COVID-19 period.US markets, including the S&P with a market capitalisation of approximately 52.9 trillion (February 2025), appear to have reached their limits after delivering exceptional returns. Investors are reassessing earnings forecasts amidst persistent volatility. The prominent 'magnificent 7' stocks display vulnerability following the Deep Seek event, with traditionally stable companies like Apple facing scrutiny of their safe-haven status, says the SBI report.Investment flows are shifting towards more affordable markets as investors seek enhanced returns, evidenced by increased activity in mainland China and Hong Kong markets. Analysts anticipate possible corrections in overvalued markets. The ongoing series of reciprocal tariffs creates conditions for increased market instability in forthcoming periods.The SBI report says that positive structural adjustments could potentially elevate GDP trends. Despite modest productivity improvements, increased national savings could enhance potential GDP. Private sector re-engagement combined with technological advancements could boost growth prospects, though initial adaptation periods may present challenges. The SBI report notes the following:","Long trends indicate possible downturn in US economy, says SBI in its latest report. Long term trends in GDP indicate decline in potential GDP, demand and investments. US indebtedness has sharply increased over the years, crowding out the private sector. Current tariff policy will have short term pain.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119169633,imgsize-43404,width-400,resizemode-4/119169633.jpg"

Solana meme coins , once the stars of 2024, have seen their market caps decline in recent months. However, one standout project is defying the trend. Solaxy ’s crypto presale is rapidly approaching the $30 million mark, undeterred by the broader market downturn.Unlike typical meme coins, Solaxy aims to go beyond fleeting hype, positioning itself as a game-changer for the Solana ecosystem with its ambitious layer-2 scaling solution .The Solana meme coin market has been quiet for a while now. The tokens that captured massive attention in 2024 are losing value.BONK, for example, has seen a steep 45% drop on the monthly chart. From one of last year’s hottest tokens, it is at risk of being another forgetful meme coin.But it’s not just the Solana meme coin market that is suffering. Significant members of the market like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have also seen a sharp decline. The overall crypto market is in a downtrend, with Bitcoin slipping under $90,000. On top of that, Solana’s frequent congestion issues are driving users and developers away. While the network was a hot hub for meme coins in 2024, its rising transaction fees and slow processing times are making it less attractive for new projects. Solaxy brings real utility to the Solana network. It is developing Solana’s first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution.The project’s goal is to address the blockchain’s congestion issues head-on by processing transactions off-chain. After that, they are batched for final verification.The mechanism could significantly reduce the strain on Solana’s mainnet by lowering transaction fees and expediting processing speeds.Even during peak trading hours, Solaxy could help keep the network frictionless.Beyond scalability, Solaxy has bigger ambitions. According to its white paper, the project plans to introduce cross-chain functionality between Solana and Ethereum.In other words, it is not just another scaling tool. It has the potential to bridge major blockchain ecosystems, unlocking opportunities in NFTs , gaming, and DeFi.Solaxy’s growing popularity indicates that investors are ready to back innovative projects despite the bearish market. Influential crypto voices like Austin Hilton have taken notice of the project, highlighting its core features.Even as the broader market struggles, Solaxy is gaining strong momentum.Solaxy is currently priced at just $0.001648, while Solana is selling for $130. The price difference presents a significant upside for early investors.While Solana has a $65 billion market cap, Solaxy’s starting valuation leaves substantial room for potential growth. The presale price is a major attraction for early investors.The incentives don’t stop there. Early adopters can benefit from Solaxy’s passive rewards program. It allows investors to earn by locking their tokens. Solaxy’s current annual percentage yield (APY) stands at around 150%, presenting an opportunity for investors seeking long-term gains. More than 6.5 billion tokens have been locked into the protocol so far. With 25% of the supply set aside for community rewards, the team shows commitment to stability. The strategy could reduce early-stage sell-offs and lay a robust path for growth.Security is another factor working in Solaxy’s favour.

"How to deal with Trump: Flattery, retaliation, or holding out?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-to-deal-with-trump-flattery-retaliation-or-holding-out/articleshow/119121261.cms,"Trump has consistently portrayed himself as an excellent dealmaker.

Why it matters

Trump’s America First approach is forcing allies to rethink their economic and military dependencies. Countries that once assumed Washington was a reliable partner are now questioning whether Trump’s transactional style leaves them vulnerable.

Economic risks: Retaliatory tariffs could escalate into a full-scale trade war, disrupting supply chains and rattling financial markets.

Retaliatory tariffs could escalate into a full-scale trade war, disrupting supply chains and rattling financial markets. Diplomatic d ilemmas: Nations must decide whether to challenge Trump’s rhetoric publicly or attempt to negotiate exemptions quietly.

Nations must decide whether to challenge Trump’s rhetoric publicly or attempt to negotiate exemptions quietly. Security concerns: Trump’s threats to Nato and his unpredictable foreign policy approach have left many allies, particularly in Europe, rethinking their military strategies.

The big picture

1. Canada’s aggressive retaliation

When Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada struck back with tariffs on US goods and a fee hike on electricity exports to the US.

imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada struck back with tariffs on US goods and a fee hike on electricity exports to the US. Trump responded with threats to double Canada’s tariffs, sparking a fiery exchange with Ontario Premier Doug Ford . Both sides eventually walked back their actions, but tensions remain high.

. Both sides eventually walked back their actions, but tensions remain high. The risk? The confrontation led to economic instability, with Canadian markets reacting negatively to the trade war, the Politico report said.

2. Mexico’s quiet diplomacy

Unlike Canada, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has avoided retaliatory measures and has instead sought behind-the-scenes negotiations.

Sheinbaum has held off on retaliating against Trump’s fentanyl-related tariffs and the new steel and aluminum tariffs, hoping to negotiate exemptions.

The risk? Mexico’s passive approach has yet to yield major wins, and Trump’s administration still sees Mexico as an easy target, the Politico report added.

3. Europe’s coordinated response

The EU is retaliating in phases, announcing a two-stage tariff plan targeting $28 billion in US goods, set to begin on April 1.

Trump falsely claimed on Truth Social that the EU had already implemented a 50% tariff on whiskey, vowing to hit French wines and champagnes with a 200% tariff in response.

The risk? A full-scale trade war between the EU and the US could disrupt global markets and deepen the economic divide between Western allies.

4. China’s strategic patience?

Unlike other countries, China’s rhetoric has been high but response has been measured, allowing space for negotiations.

Beijing is believed to be pursuing a new trade deal, similar to the 2020 agreement during Trump’s first term.

The risk? A full-blown US-China trade war would really hit the world economy hard.

5. The UK and Japan’s cautious approach

The UK has refused to retaliate, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer sending trade officials to Washington to negotiate exemptions.

Japan and Australia are following a similar path, opting for quiet diplomacy instead of direct confrontation.

The risk? While this approach may prevent economic escalation, it also allows Trump to set the terms of the trade dispute unchallenged.

6. India: A different approach

India’s approach reflects a strategic blend of diplomacy, economic pragmatism, and a focus on safeguarding its domestic interests. Recent moves like slashing motorcycle tariffs and dropping retaliatory duties on US agricultural goods in 2023 signal India’s willingness to make concessions to de-escalate tensions.

At the same time, India is engaged in active bilateral negotiations, aiming to finalize a mutually beneficial trade agreement.

What they are saying

William Reinsch, former US commerce official, told Politico: “Is it better to grovel and kiss the ring or stand up to the bully? Both have worked on occasion and both have failed. So it’s hard to know in any given circumstance which one is the better tactic.”

EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic: “There’s still time for the US to settle this without unnecessary pain.”

Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick: “Europe and Canada do not respect Trump or America’s ability to build its steel and aluminum industry.”

Mexico’s former US ambassador, Arturo Sarukhán: “More aggressive responses, like Canada’s and the EU’s, could backfire.”

Between the lines

Not only tariffs, Trump’s Nato stance is also alarming US allies. His remark that he would “encourage” Russia to attack Nato members who fail to meet defense spending targets has left European nations deeply concerned.

Meanwhile, Canada is pivoting towards Europe. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first foreign visit was to France and the UK, signaling a shift away from dependence on the US.

Germany is increasing defense spending to counter Trump’s unpredictability, committing billions to military expansion in response to his Nato skepticism.

Germany has announced historic defense spending, breaking from its post-WWII reluctance.

Some European leaders are considering an independent nuclear deterrent, possibly involving France and the UK.

Canada is reinforcing its Arctic presence, fearing Trump’s annexation rhetoric.

What’s next

April 2 is the next flashpoint. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs will take effect, potentially triggering more retaliatory measures.

Canada and the EU may accelerate new trade alliances to reduce dependence on the US.

Mexico’s wait-and-see strategy could pay off if Trump offers exemptions, but risks looking weak.

Nato members may push for alternative defense structures, anticipating further US disengagement.

As US President Donald Trump imposes tariffs and shakes up long-standing alliances, world leaders are testing different approaches to dealing with his unpredictable style. From Mexico to Canada to China to EU, different nations and leaders have pursued starkly different strategies with mixed results.With a fresh wave of tariffs on steel and aluminum in effect and more reciprocal tariffs looming in April, other nations are watching closely. Should they retaliate forcefully, like Canada and the EU, or opt for quiet diplomacy, like Mexico and the UK? The answer could determine the global economic and security landscape for years to come.According to a Politico report, countries are adopting different tactics to deal with Trump’s aggressive economic policies, each with its own set of risks and rewards:(With inputs from agencies)",Trump’s America First approach is forcing allies to rethink their economic and military dependencies. Nations must decide whether to challenge Trump publicly or attempt to negotiate exemptions quietly. A full-scale trade war could disrupt global markets and deepen the economic divide between Western allies.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119121486,imgsize-33234,width-400,resizemode-4/119121486.jpg"

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

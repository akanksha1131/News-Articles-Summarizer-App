Andhra Pradesh Defence Corridor

The proposal includes relocating AMCA manufacturing to the Lepakshi-Madakasira hub, envisioned as the defence industrial corridor's primary centre.

Sources indicate that Naidu emphasised HAL's constraints within Bengaluru's infrastructure, suggesting Andhra Pradesh could offer expanded land resources and enhanced policy incentives.

The Visakhapatnam-Anakapalli hub, spanning 3,000 acres, is presented as a potential site for Naval Equipment and Weapons Testing. The proposal includes designating the seafront area as a marine and underwater SEZ, supporting both Eastern Naval Command and National Advanced Offshore Base.

For the Jaggiahpet-Donakonda hub, there's a proposal to establish an IAF Station at Donakonda, with 6,000 acres already identified. The comprehensive plan encompasses an operational air base, logistics facilities, training centre and an R&D complex for the Indian Air Force.

Additionally, Naidu highlighted that HAL, anticipating orders worth Rs 2.5 trillion by 2026-27, is increasing production of LCA and Light Combat Helicopters, with Andhra Pradesh ready to support this expansion with necessary infrastructure.

The fourth industrial centre, spanning 4,000 acres at Kurnool-Orvakal, has been designated for the production of military drones, robotics and sophisticated defence components.

The fifth centre is slated for defence innovation research and development activities in Tirupati.

HAL defence aircraft to be made in Andhra Pradesh? N Chandrababu Naidu, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh and a significant NDA ally, has proposed relocating the production facilities of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited's (HAL) Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) and Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) from Karnataka to Andhra Pradesh. He has offered 10,000 acres at the Lepakshi-Madakasira hub, situated an hour's distance from Bengaluru airport, for establishing HAL's AMCA production facility.HAL, in partnership with various private organisations, is developing and manufacturing AMCA, India's fifth-generation stealth fighter aircraft.According to an ET report, the offer for setting up the facility forms part of Naidu's comprehensive proposal for establishing a defence industrial corridor, India's third following Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.Also Read | Target where it hurts: India wants Pakistan back on FATF ‘grey list’; to oppose World Bank loans The proposed corridor spans 23,000 acres across Andhra Pradesh from north to south, incorporating five strategic hubs. The Chief Minister presented these plans during his meeting with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday.The defence industrial corridors leverage existing manufacturing infrastructure whilst encouraging private sector investments. These corridors aim to boost domestic production of defence and aerospace equipment, thereby reducing import dependency and fostering international exports.During his two-day visit to the capital, Naidu held meetings with several cabinet ministers including Amit Shah (Home), Nirmala Sitharaman (Finance), Prahlad Joshi (New and Renewable Energy), CR Patil (Jal Shakti), Dr Jitendra Singh (Science and Technology) and Ashwini Vaishnaw (IT).Also Read | Forced to destroy!

Fadnavis further shared that the government has already undertaken a 100-day program focusing on good governance, citizen-centric reforms, and accountability, during which over 700 targets were successfully met across various departments, reported PTI.""The goal is to transform Maharashtra's economy into a $one trillion economy by 2030 and $five trillion by 2047,"" Fadnavis explained.Fadnavis also announced that the state is in the midst of a 150-day action plan.This plan includes a long-term vision for 2047, a medium-term target for 2035 (coinciding with Maharashtra's 75th anniversary), and a short-term five-year plan with annual targets for 2029.In addition to economic development, the Chief Minister outlined a roadmap for the state’s green energy transition, emphasizing the progress in renewable energy initiatives.

Centre's ownership of banks cuts 'lender of last resort' risk for RBI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centres-ownership-of-banks-cuts-lender-of-last-resort-risk-for-rbi/articleshow/121398593.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI has acknowledged that government's ownership of public sector banks makes its risk management job easier. In its latest economic capital framework report, RBI notes that such ownership has ""demonstrably reduced the potential losses"" it might face when offering emergency liquidity assistance (ELA), warranting lower capital buffers for these entities.In other words, govt-owned lenders are being treated as a safer bet - because govt behaves like a parent company with deep pockets. The ""inherent strength due to sovereign ownership"" makes public banks less risky for RBI to backstop and lightens the capital load it must carry to do so.""The present review proposes to account for the inherent strength due to sovereign ownership in case of PSBs, while assessing the recovery rates,"" the report states. This approach is justified, RBI argues, by govt's track record: ""Govt had infused an amount of more than Rs 3.1 lakh crore as capital during the period since RBI's asset quality review.""The capital infusion has helped bring down non-performing assets in the banking sector from a high of 9.3% (12.6% for PSBs) in March 2019 to a multi-year low of 2.6% (3.3% for PSBs) in Sept 2024.RBI noted that ""the expert committee had estimated potential LOLR (lender of last resort) losses for RBI based on uniform recovery rate of 80 % on ELA against non-hiqh quality liquid assets collateral for both private and public sector banks"".However, the current review departs from this.This backing translates into tangible regulatory leniency. ""Accordingly, the potential LOLR losses of RBI for the quantum of loans extended to PSBs have been assumed to be lower (10%) as compared to private sector banks (20%),"" the report says - halving the assumed loss thanks to the implicit state guarantee. The resulting stress-test estimates suggest that , even under duress, RBI would face potential losses of just about 3% of its balance sheet, assuming recovery rates of 90% for PSBs and 80% for private banks.The report also notes that given the global operations of scheduled commercial banks, the possibility of RBI having to provide liquidity in foreign currency to overseas branches of such lenders in periods of stress, with tightening of counterparty credit lines and widening of spreads, may not be ruled out.","RBI acknowledges that government's ownership of public sector banks makes its risk management job easier.

Prosus' India strategy: Mix of investments & acquisitions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/prosus-india-strategy-mix-of-investments-acquisitions/articleshow/121398524.cms,"MUMBAI: Dutch technology investor Prosus will use a mix of investments and acquisitions to bolster its play in India, where it is seeking to build a portfolio worth $50 billion in the years to come, Group CEO Fabricio Bloisi, who took over the top job in July last year, said.The firm's approach will not be like that of a venture capital (VC) investor looking to close a series of deals at a faster clip. The strategy will rather be to build an ecosystem by investing in or acquiring companies within its core sectors, which can potentially open up opportunities for cross-selling among its portfolio firms and unlock faster growth for the broader portfolio.India, where Prosus will be allocating most of its resources alongside Europe and Latin America, is a market with a lot of potential, Bloisi said, adding that the company will be investing billions in India in the next few years. ""We want to be less of an investor that has a pipeline of 100 companies with 5% (stake) in each one and more of an ecosystem that develops synergies between our own companies... We intend to invest more money in more companies. I will be disappointed if it's not a few billion,"" Bloisi told TOI in an interview.Prosus has invested $8.6 billion in India so far and has backed a clutch of startups, including Meesho, Swiggy, Urban Company, and Rapido.It also had a few failed bets like Byju's, which Bloisi said was the ""worst problem"" the company faced globally. However, the downfall of India's biggest edtech startup, once valued at $22 billion, did not change its investment perspective on the country. ""Making wrong bets and correcting is a part of life. We lost a lot of money in Byju's, but we made much more money than we lost. Swiggy IPO was successful, and companies like Meesho and Swiggy have a lot of growth ahead... The $50 billion would be five or seven companies together, and probably four or five of these seven are already in our portfolio and will keep growing to get there,"" Bloisi said.Prosus will continue to prioritise investments in its core areas of food delivery, payments, e-commerce, experience (including services provided by firms like Urban Company), and AI. Bloisi, however, said that options in other sectors will not be closed, and it will be open to scouting for opportunities in emerging sectors such as clean tech and EV, although the company is unlikely to go big on these sectors as of now.Within AI, where Bloisi said India can do more, the company's strategy will be to back companies that are using AI to build their services, offer more use cases to consumers, and incorporate AI tools to make systems more efficient rather than betting on firms developing pure-play AI models. Meesho, for instance, he said, was able to reduce its costs by using AI, besides adding more languages to its app, enabling it to reach more consumers.""Most of the successful companies of the future are being built today on top of the (AI infrastructure) models. They (models) are just the first step... there's so much value to build, for example, marketing or video companies that are going to use AI models to offer services, and these are the type of companies we expect to invest in,"" Bloisi said, voicing the need for calibrated regulation.Regulating a sector like AI, which is still nascent and evolving, will slow innovation. ""There will be so much change in AI, and it's not a local thing. It's a global play. There are Indian, American, Brazilian models. I am not supportive of AI regulation,"" Bloisi said.Prosus expects five companies from its India portfolio to go public this year, but Bloisi declined to name them. Urban Company and BlueStone have already filed draft IPO papers with Sebi, while some, like Meesho, are preparing to list.",Dutch technology investor Prosus will use a mix of investments and acquisitions to bolster its play in India.

Regulators are reviewing regulations to ensure that approvals come faster. While he said that sectoral FDI caps were already liberal, insurance regulator IRDAI has set up a panel to overhaul the law, including plans to allow 100% FDI in the sector.The moves come at a time when Donald Trump is seeking to get American companies, including the likes of Apple, to invest more in the US. When asked, Bhatia said: ""Companies are working on a resilient supply chain, and a certain portion of the production is naturally coming to India given that it has a large domestic market at present, which will grow steadily. There is a very strong positive interest from investors, which has translated into greater FDI flows into the country. "" Besides, he added, India has the ""entire spectrum of skills"" to attract investment in manufacturing and R&D.Asked about the large FDI outflows, which pulled down net FDI by 97% to 383 million in FY25, Bhatia said some of it was due to companies repatriating funds after IPOs, while Indian companies were also investing overseas. ""Indian companies are growing in scale globally, and they are investing abroad to tie up resources, technology, and be part of the global value chain. It will generate more dividends and inflows in the future. """,India saw FDI inflows increase by 13.6% to $81 billion in FY25.

"Apple pips Xiaomi, enters top 5 in India; at nearly 20% market share, Vivo leads pack",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/apple-pips-xiaomi-enters-top-5-in-india/articleshow/121398352.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major upset in the Indian smartphone market, Apple overtook Chinese giant Xiaomi in sales during the first quarter of this year, cracking the Top 5 ranking in terms of market share.While Apple has gained from rising demand for its premium iPhones, the fall for Xiaomi - which is now ranked sixth according to the latest IDC numbers - has been unprecedented considering that the company dominated the Indian market for several years, lording over top global, while also decimating homegrown players such as Micromax, Lava, and Karbonn.The category is now led by fellow Chinese Vivo, which is sitting on top of the pile, followed by Samsung, Oppo, realme, and Apple (see graphic). While Samsung stayed flat, Vivo and Oppo also gained market share, with almost all players expanding at Xiaomi's expense.Apple's juggernaut seems to be going strong due to the aggressive nature of its India sales strategy, including rollout of attractive finance schemes.Research firm IDC said Apple is the brand to watch out for as the average selling price (ASP) of iPhones in India is roughly three times the broader market, which simply means people are ready to pay significantly more for an Apple device.""Anybody and everybody wants an iPhone. People see iPhones in the hands of their friends and family and want one for themselves. You can even call it peer pressure or simply the pull of the brand,"" Navkendar Singh, analyst with IDC Asia Pacific, told TOI.Sources said Xiaomi has been going through a challenging period over the past few years, battling a slew of regulatory troubles and tax cases apart from leadership changes. ""The company has seen numerous tax-related disputes, and these include investigations by the Enforcement Directorate and income tax department. This has had a massive impact on the morale of senior management,"" a source said. The company saw the exit of CEO Manu Jain, who first went to Dubai and then parted ways at the height of tax probe in early 2023. There have been other top management exits.Many also blame the decline in Xiaomi's numbers to the change of strategy as it vied for more premium devices against being a mainstream player. ""This strategy has failed and the company's products are priced out in several categories. The company has also lost its grip in its core online sales, apart from being weak in offline too,"" the source said.","Apple overtook Chinese giant Xiaomi in sales during the first quarter of this year.

The company has already implemented a fraud detection solution aimed at blocking rogue websites on communication and social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook, and Instagram.""However, given the recent alarming rise in phishing attempts and malicious URL-based scams targeting unsuspecting individuals, it became evident that more coordinated industry action was needed. These sophisticated fraud schemes often exploit the gaps in coordination between service providers,"" Airtel said in letters to Telecom Secretary Neeraj Mittal and Trai Chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti.Updating both the telecom department and Trai on its ongoing measures, Airtel said it has once again reached out to other Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) with a proposal to launch a Joint Telecom Fraud Initiative on May 14, 2025.""This initiative would bring together all TSPs to collaboratively detect, prevent, and mitigate telecom fraud and scams across our networks through real-time fraud intelligence sharing and cross-network coordination,"" the letter stated.Airtel also recalled its earlier appeal made in October 2024, where it had written to all TSPs proposing a collaborative approach to tackle the growing issue of Unsolicited Commercial Communications (UCC).That proposal suggested mutual sharing of corporate connection details used for commercial calling, in a standardised format, to proactively monitor spam and prevent misuse. It also included the idea of creating a centralised data-sharing platform similar to the existing Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) system to combat UCC effectively without hampering legitimate enterprise services.Meanwhile, Airtel Vice Chairman and Managing Director Gopal Vittal is expected to soon reach out directly to customers via email to raise awareness about financial frauds and scams, which he described as “a regular threat for Indians.”Sources said Vittal’s message will detail Airtel’s ongoing initiatives, including the AI-powered spam detection solution launched last year, and new tools to detect suspicious links across OTT platforms, social media, and messaging apps, and block them in real time.Vittal warned that scam tactics have evolved and become more organised and dangerous over the past year.""Fraudsters today are targeting people not just through calls and texts but also through chats, emails, social media apps and other platforms,"" he said.He cautioned that scammers often impersonate banks, utility services, or courier companies, sending messages that appear urgent to trick users into clicking malicious links.""And these links look absolutely genuine, almost impossible to tell apart from the real ones. Once you click, they extract your personal and financial information and use it to scam you. We are seeing an alarming surge in such threats in the last few days,"" he added.On the new protection mechanism, Vittal reassured customers that “whenever they are on the Airtel mobile network or connected to Airtel Wi-Fi, this added layer of protection will be active by default.”","Bharti Airtel has reached out to Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea with a proposal for a joint industry initiative to combat the rising menace of telecom fraud and scams.

IPO boom fuels record exits

A sign of market maturity

India Inc expands abroad

Portfolio flows outpace FDI

India witnessed a sharp 96.5 per cent drop in net foreign direct investment (FDI) in FY25, with investors cashing out of high-profile IPOs and companies ramping up investments overseas. According to data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday, net FDI fell to just $353 million, the lowest on record, from $10 billion in the previous fiscal year.The central bank attributed the sharp decline to rising outward FDI and large-scale repatriation of capital by overseas investors. ""Net FDI moderated, reflecting the rise in net outward FDI and repatriation FDI,"" the RBI said in its monthly bulletin.While gross FDI inflows rose 13.7 per cent to $81 billion in FY25, a spike in exits, particularly from long-term investors through mega IPOs, significantly eroded the net figure. Foreign investors pulled out $49 billion during the year, up from $41 billion in FY24.The steep fall in net FDI came as India's capital markets delivered strong returns, encouraging investors to lock in gains. Private equity and venture capital funds, including Alpha Wave Global and Partners Group, booked multi-billion-dollar exits in companies like Swiggy and Vishal Mega Mart.According to a report by the Indian Venture Capital and Alternate Capital Association (IVCA) and EY, PE/VC exits totalled $26.7 billion in FY25, a 7 per cent increase from the previous year.The report noted that open market exits and PE-backed IPOs gained significant traction amid soaring valuations and bullish investor sentiment.One of the most prominent IPOs was that of Hyundai Motor India, which raised Rs 27,870 crore as the parent company reduced its stake from 100 per cent to 82.5 per cent, repatriating the proceeds. A key foreign investor in Swiggy also realised over $2 billion from its share sale. Telecom major Singtel sold part of its holding in Airtel, and British American Tobacco (BAT) exited a stake in ITC, contributing to repatriation figures.India's benchmark stock indices hit record highs in late September 2024, triggering a wave of IPOs and providing a fertile exit environment for early-stage and institutional investors.Analysts view the trend not as a weakness but as evidence of a more evolved investment ecosystem. ""The ability to attract, retain, and smoothly exit capital reflects positively on the maturity of Indian markets,"" the IVCA-EY report said.The RBI also noted that while net FDI dropped, gross FDI remained concentrated in core sectors like manufacturing, financial services, energy, and communications, which accounted for more than 60 per cent of total inflows.In a parallel trend, Indian firms continued to invest heavily overseas. Outward direct investments surged to $29 billion in FY25 from $17 billion in FY24, reflecting corporate India's growing global ambitions amid a realignment of global supply chains.""Indian companies are increasingly looking outward to tap global markets, build scale, and diversify supply bases,"" said an economist tracking the trend.Adding to the shift in capital dynamics, net portfolio investments, considered more volatile, stood at $2.67 billion in FY25, more than six times the net FDI figure. The RBI noted that this marked a rare instance where traditionally 'stable' FDI was outpaced by 'hot money' portfolio flows.","Net FDI fell to just $353 million, the lowest on record, from $10 billion in the previous fiscal year.

‘Pak Army, ISI Agents Entered…’: J&K EX-CM Exposes Islamabad In Arab Nation

A recent World Bank study has found that Pakistan’s General Sales Tax (GST) is a major contributor to rising poverty levels, while targeted cash transfer schemes such as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) are helping reduce inequality.Titled “The Effects of Taxes and Transfers on Inequality and Poverty in Pakistan,” the report reveals that GST consumes more than 7 per cent of households’ pre-tax spending, disproportionately burdening low-income families and deepening financial stress. Citing the study, a report in Dawn, quoted by news agency PTI, on Sunday noted that GST is the single most significant fiscal policy factor driving up national poverty rates.Education spending- particularly at the pre-primary and primary levels- was identified as the second-largest contributor to inequality, according to the report.In contrast, the BISP emerged as the most effective tool in narrowing inequality. The programme, which provides monthly financial support to the poorest households, has shown the most meaningful impact among all assessed fiscal interventions.The World Bank study calls for Pakistan to enhance domestic revenue collection and improve expenditure efficiency.It urges the government to create additional fiscal space through reforms and to channel those resources into expanding social protection and improving the quality and reach of essential public services.Crucially, the report criticises Pakistan’s current taxation system for its dependence on indirect taxes, which are seen as more impoverishing, and on regressive subsidies. It highlights the lack of emphasis on progressive direct taxation, which would better target higher-income groups.The analysis also points to a stark imbalance in the fiscal system: the poorest households are effectively net contributors, paying more in taxes than they receive in benefits.",A recent World Bank study has found that Pakistan’s General Sales Tax (GST) is a major contributor to rising poverty levels.

The government increased the number of home appliance categories eligible for subsidies from eight in 2024 to 12 in 2025.Large-scale equipment upgrades and consumer goods trade-in initiatives were launched in March 2024 and revamped earlier this year to boost domestic demand and spur economic growth.Under the subsidy programme, consumers purchasing smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, or wristbands priced below 6,000 yuan ($850) are eligible for a subsidy covering 15 per cent of the sales price, up to a maximum of 500 yuan ($71) per item.The programme is available for both domestic and foreign brands.The Chinese government has been encouraging efforts to enhance domestic demand to strengthen the economy and counter external risks amid growing trade tensions with the US.These subsidies have led millions of Chinese consumers to upgrade their devices, benefiting both domestic and foreign brands. According to reports from official media, the government also offers a subsidy of 20,000 yuan (around $2,850) for electric vehicles.The Ministry of Commerce noted that the digital product subsidy policies have contributed to a market shift towards higher-end products.Third-party data revealed that the sales volume of smartphones priced between 2,000 yuan ($278) and 4,000 yuan ($570) increased by 13 per cent year-on-year during the first four months of 2025, while sales of smartphones in the 4,000 to 6,000 yuan ($850) range surged by 43 per cent.","As of Thursday, over 48 million consumers participated in the government’s digital product subsidy scheme, purchasing a total of 51.48 million products.

In 2024, gross national savings in emerging Asia (excluding Taiwan and Korea) stood at 39 per cent of GDP, compared to 20.1 per cent for G7 countries and 17.3 per cent for another unnamed group.The report also discussed the economic situation in the United States, noting that the risk of a near-term recession has reduced significantly, primarily due to the Trump administration’s decision to step back from its previous tariff plans. These tariffs, if implemented, could have led to higher costs for ordinary Americans and acted as a regressive tax in a country already grappling with severe income inequality.According to 2022 data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the top 1 per cent of Americans earned 22.4 per cent of total gross individual income and paid 40.4 per cent of all income taxes. The top 10 per cent accounted for nearly half of the income (49.4 per cent) and paid 72 per cent of the taxes. In contrast, the bottom 50 per cent of Americans earned only 11.5 per cent of the income and contributed just 3 per cent to income tax collections. In 2023, individual income tax accounted for 53.5 per cent of total tax collections in the US.","Asian currencies are expected to appreciate against the US dollar in the long term.

Energy and sustainability:

Need for macroeconomic structure:

Forex restructure:

The International Monetary Fund said that it was in talks with Pakistan, holding “constructive discussions” focused on the FY2025-26 budget and key economic reforms. The IMF team began high-level policy talks on 19 May in Islamabad and are expected to continue in the coming days.However, with no final agreement reached, its government pushed back the announcement of the budget to 10 June.The negotiations are part of Pakistan's ongoing efforts to secure continued support under the IMF’s loan arrangements.“We held constructive discussions with the authorities on their FY2026 budget proposals and broader economic policy, and reform agenda supported by the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the 2025 Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF),” said Nathan Porter, the IMF’s mission chief, in a statement quoted by PTI.The current round of talks revolved around revenue enhancement, including better tax compliance and expanding the tax base, alongside prioritising expenditure.""The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation while safeguarding social and priority expenditures, aiming for a primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of GDP in FY2026,"" Porter said.Energy sector reform was high on the agenda.Porter said that these discussions aimed towards reducing the cost structure of Pakistan’s power sector and improving its financial stability, moves seen as vital to economic sustainability and investor confidence.The IMF highlighted the importance of a sound macroeconomic framework, saying that maintaining an “appropriately tight and data-dependent monetary policy remains a priority to ensure inflation is maintained within the bank's medium-term target range of 5–7 per cent.Porter also raised the need to rebuild the country’s foreign exchange reserves and support a fully functioning exchange rate market. Rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, maintaining a well-functioning forex market and increasing exchange rate flexibility are essential for boosting resilience against external shocks, he said.The IMF said its next mission to Pakistan, as part of the upcoming EFF and RSF reviews, is expected in the second half of 2025.Pakistan signed a $7 billion extended fund facility with the IMF last year and has received two tranches so far, including the most recent disbursal earlier this month.The approval came despite objections from India's objections that the funds may be diverted to finance cross border terrorism. On 16 May, defence minister Rajnath Singh urged the IMF to rethink the support, claiming that the funds could be diverted by Islamabad to boost its terror activities.","IMF team began high-level policy talks on 19 May in Islamabad.

In a fresh attack on overseas manufacturing, US President Donald Trump has warned Apple that iPhones not made in the United States could face a 25% tariff, and other smartphone makers like Samsung may not be spared either.Speaking on Truth Social and later to reporters at the White House, Trump said he expects Apple and its CEO Tim Cook to move production from countries like India back to the United States. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone ’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” he posted Friday. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.”He added in person, “It would be more. It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product. Otherwise it wouldn’t be fair.”Trump’s comments follow reports that Apple is planning to produce most of its US-sold iPhones in India. Cook had told investors during an earnings call earlier this month that “the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin.”The warning comes after Trump met Cook in Riyadh last week and again at the White House on Tuesday.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook,” Trump said during a stop in Qatar. “I said to him, ‘Tim, you’re my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming in with $500 billion.’ But now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.”The move could have serious consequences for Apple and US consumers. Analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities said it would cost the company roughly $30 billion and up to 10 years to fully move iPhone production to America. “The concept of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,” Ives said. He added that the cost of US-made iPhones could reach $3,500 if Apple replicated its Asian supply chain locally.Gene Munster from Deepwater Asset Management said Apple may not be able to absorb the cost of tariffs forever. “Anything below 30, they will probably carry the vast majority of that increase,” he explained. “But I think at some point they’re going to have to start to share it.”Apple has announced a $500 billion US investment plan to ease tensions, which includes building server facilities in Houston and expanding data centres in 20 states.Despite Apple’s efforts, Trump appears firm. “When they build their plant here, there’s no tariffs. So they’re going to be building plants here,” he said.Samsung, which mostly manufactures in South Korea, Vietnam, India, and Brazil, could also be hit. Although it moved out of China years ago, Trump insisted that all non-US phone production would face the same treatment. “It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” he said.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent supported Trump’s call, saying the goal is to “bring back precision manufacturing to the US.” He also flagged concerns about the security of Apple’s semiconductor supply chain.",US President Donald Trump has warned Apple that iPhones not made in the United States could face a 25% tariff.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 25% tariff on Apple products unless iPhones are made in America, a move that will likely impact the company's production plans in India. Trump also said he would impose a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union.The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump's ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing.Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major US companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs.""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's (sic) that will be sold in the US will be manufactured and built in the US, not India, or any place else,"" Trump wrote. ""If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US."" The statement suggests Apple itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes.","US President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 25% tariff on Apple products unless iPhones are made in America.

'India Can Take Care...': Trump Scolds Apple's Tim Cook For Making iPhones In 'High Tariff' Nation

Trump declares 50% tariff on EU



Trump threat shakes European markets, Apple shares fall

US President Donald Trump issued a fresh warning to Apple on Friday, saying the company should face a 25% tariff if it manufactures iPhones in ""India or anyplace else."" Trump asserted that he had already informed Apple CEO Tim Cook that he expects iPhones sold in the US to be made in America.Trump took to his Truth Social platform, directly addressing the Apple CEO claiming that, ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else.""""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US Thank your for your attention to this matter!"" he added.The remarks come at a time when Apple is aggressively expanding its manufacturing footprint in India. The company, along with its key suppliers, has been shifting production out of China, a move accelerated by pandemic-related disruptions and ongoing geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing.During a previous state visit to Qatar, Trump recounted a conversation with Cook in which he criticised Apple's increasing investment in India.Trump said, ""I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. I said to him, 'my friend, I treated you very good. You're coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you're building all over India.""""I don't want you building in India. India can take care of themselves,"" Trump reportedly told Cook on May 15.Trump was referring to Apple’s earlier pledge to invest $500 billion in the United States, announced in February.During the technology firm's first-quarter earnings announcement in early May, Cook stated that ""a majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin"".Apple has increased its production in India, aiming to manufacture approximately 25% of global iPhones in the country within the next few years, whilst reducing its dependence on China, where about 90% of its flagship smartphones are currently assembled.The company produced roughly $22 billion worth of iPhones in India in the year ending March 2025, showing a 60% rise from the previous year.At present, India manufactures one in five iPhones globally, demonstrating the company's efforts to distribute production beyond China amidst ongoing trade disputes.Trump also said that his administration would impose a 50 per cent tariff on the European Union as trade talks were ""going nowhere"".Miffed at Washington's current trade deficit with the European Union, Trump said the Bloc was formed ""for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States "".""Their powerful Trade Barriers, Vat Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies, and more, have led to a Trade Deficit with the US of more than $250,000,000 a year, a number which is totally unacceptable,"" he posted on Truth Social.""Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he added.Stock markets in both the US and Europe experienced significant declines early Friday following his social media announcements regarding tariffs targeting Apple and the EU.Prior to market opening, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures decreased by 1.5%, whilst Nasdaq futures fell 1.7%. Both oil prices and Treasury yields experienced downward movements.European markets dropped sharply following Trump's post on Truth Social.

Equities mostly climbed on Friday, bouncing back from the previous day’s sell-off triggered by rising US Treasury yields. The recovery came as yields pulled back slightly and optimism grew following the House passage of President Donald Trump’s expansive tax-cutting budget.Market anxiety had been stirred earlier in the week after Moody’s stripped the US of its top-tier credit rating, citing concerns over soaring deficits. These fears intensified following a weak 20-year Treasury auction on Wednesday, which spooked investors already reeling from Trump’s recent tariff measures, news agency AFP reported.Sentiment steadied Thursday after the Republican-controlled House narrowly approved the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” which extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for a decade. The plan, which trims social programs to offset costs, now moves to the Senate. Fiscal conservatives remain wary, as independent analyses predict the bill could widen the deficit by up to $4 trillion over ten years.The White House argues the legislation will stimulate economic growth to 5.2%, claiming the growth would neutralize the bill’s impact on the national debt, which stands at $36 trillion. These projections, however, remain outside mainstream economic consensus.“Perhaps the fiscal worries have gone a bit too far,” said Chris Weston of Pepperstone. “The bill appears to be more neutral than overly stimulative and may not lead to the massive deficit surge predicted for 2026 and 2027.”Treasury yields eased amid stronger-than-expected US data on jobs, housing, and factory output, helping stabilize equities. Wall Street's mixed close gave way to modest gains across Asia, including Tokyo, Hong Kong, Sydney, Mumbai, Bangkok, Manila, and Jakarta, while Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, and Wellington lagged.Investor sentiment was also buoyed by remarks from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, who suggested interest rate cuts could follow if Trump’s tariffs are reduced to 10% by July.“If we can get the tariffs down closer to 10 percent and that’s all sealed, done and delivered somewhere by July, then we’re in good shape for the second half of the year,” Waller told Fox Business.Meanwhile, the dollar fell against the yen after Japanese inflation rose more than expected, driven by surging food prices—particularly rice. The figure could influence the Bank of Japan’s upcoming policy decisions following recent rate hikes.In the crypto sector, Bitcoin continued its upward march, hitting a new record of $111,980.33 amid optimism for upcoming regulation on stable coins, raising hopes for broader regulatory clarity.","Tokyo - Nikkei 225: up 0.5% at 37,160.47 (close) Shanghai - Composite: down 0.9% at 3,348.37 ( close) London - FTSE 100: up0.4% at 8,771.35 (close), Dollar/yen: down at 143.34 from 143.99; Euro/dollar: up at $1.1335 from $ 1.1281.

Jakob Stausholm, the CEO of mining giant Rio Tinto, will step down later this year, the company announced on Thursday, marking a surprise move. Stausholm, who led the company through a period of significant cultural and strategic transformation, will remain in his role until a successor is named.Rio Tinto did not specify the reason for Stausholm's departure, saying only that the succession process is already underway and this was deemed ""a natural moment"" for leadership change. Analysts, however, expressed surprise at the timing and lack of a clear rationale.""This news comes as a big surprise, and in our view was not expected,"" said Richard Hatch , an analyst at Berenberg. ""It does not feel that natural to us.""Stausholm took the helm in late 2020 following the destruction of the Juukan Gorge Aboriginal heritage site in Western Australia, an incident that triggered widespread condemnation and led to the resignation of his predecessor. One of his first major actions as CEO was to commission a comprehensive review of the company's workplace culture, which exposed systemic issues, including racism, bullying and harassment.Under his leadership, Rio Tinto committed to improving its environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and pivoted toward future-facing minerals, most notably lithium. The company has made several strategic investments in battery metal, including the Rincon project in Argentina, a $6.7 billion acquisition of US-based Arcadium Lithium, and a $900 million investment in the Maricunga lithium project in Chile through a partnership with Codelco.""We had expected Mr Stausholm to remain with the company and drive the integration of the lithium business, so his exit comes as a surprise,"" Hatch added.The company has yet to name a successor, but internal candidates reportedly include chief commercial officer Bold Baatar, head of iron ore Simon Trott, and aluminium division head Jerome Pecresse.

China Accuses US of Undermining Trade Talks With Huawei Curbs

The technology standoff between the United States and China is entering a new phase, with the Trump administration sharpening its focus on cutting-edge chips that power artificial intelligence (AI). At the centre of this evolving conflict is Huawei, the Chinese tech giant whose advanced semiconductors have come under renewed US scrutiny.On May 12, the US commerce department announced it would roll back the ""AI Diffusion Rule"", a regulation introduced under former President Joe Biden to limit China’s access to high end AI chips.Originally set to take effect on May 15, the rule outlined a three-tier system that would have allowed trusted nations to import advanced semiconductors while restricting or banning their export to countries like China.The commerce department said the regulation would have stifled American innovation and strained diplomatic relations with key global partners.The same announcement served as a warning to companies: any use of Huawei’s Ascend chips which is among the most powerful in China’s arsenal and could violate US export laws. The department cautioned that deploying American-made AI chips to train Chinese AI models could trigger “potential consequences.”“This is about refocusing the firepower of AI restrictions directly on Beijing,” Lizzi Lee, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute told AFP. Other analysts echoed this same view; Manoj Harjani of Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies noted that the revised strategy places the spotlight squarely on Huawei and the Chinese tech sector. “This is a marked shift from Biden’s multilateral, alliance-driven approach,” he said.China has already made impressive strides in AI development, with homegrown startup DeepSeek shaking up the technology sector this year with a chatbot that seemingly matches the performance of US competitors at much lower cost.Chinese firms like Alibaba and Xiaomi have announced huge investments in AI in what experts say feeds into a national goal to cut reliance on foreign suppliers.The AI rivalry is playing into broader trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.The two sides traded tit-for-tat tariff hikes after Trump took power, but this month dramatically slashed levies on each other's goods for 90 days, signalling a detente for now.Beijing has condemned the US actions, accusing Washington of “bullying” and using export controls to “suppress and contain” Chinese innovation. Analysts say such rhetoric signals China’s unwillingness to back down.Despite these restrictions, China is pushing ahead with its AI ambitions. This year, Chinese startup DeepSeek drew international attention with a chatbot that reportedly rivals American products at a fraction of the cost. Tech giants like Alibaba and Xiaomi have also pledged major investments in AI, reflecting a broader push to reduce dependence on foreign technology.The intensifying AI rivalry comes amid broader trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. While the two sides recently agreed to temporarily ease tariffs for 90 days, suggesting a brief pause in hostilities, analysts say the tech battle is becoming entrenched.Lizzi Lee cautioned that unlike tariffs, which can be adjusted quickly, technology restrictions are becoming a core part of national security strategies. “The trade truce won’t stop the momentum of tech decoupling,” she said. “If the US continues to blacklist major Chinese AI players, it’s unlikely Beijing will make concessions in other areas.”","The US commerce department announced it would roll back the ""AI Diffusion Rule"", a regulation introduced under former President Joe Biden to limit China’s access to high end AI chips.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

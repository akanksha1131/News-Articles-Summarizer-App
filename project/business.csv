'His wallet is full': PNB scam whistleblower on Mehul Choksi's India extradition after arrest in Belgium,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/his-wallet-is-full-pnb-scam-whistleblower-on-mehul-choksis-india-extradition-after-arrest-in-belgium/articleshow/120270111.cms,"Mehul Choksi (AP file photo)

NEW DELHI: Punjab National Bank scam whistleblower Hariprasad SV on Monday raised doubts on fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi's chances of being extradited to India, citing Choksi's access to top legal support in Europe. His reflection on concerns of bring him back to India came after 65-year-old absconding diamond merchant was arrested in Belgium on Saturday.Speaking to ANI, Hariprasad recalled how Choksi had earlier managed to escape legal proceedings when he was detained in Dominica. ""Extradition is not an easy task. Choksi's wallet is full, and he will employ the best lawyers in Europe to avoid the process like what Vijay Mallya has been doing. I don't think it is going to be easy for India to get him back,"" he said.Also read: From Antigua to Belgium: Will fugitive Mehul Choksi finally be extradited to India? ""When he was caught in Antigua (Dominica) and other islands, he could manage to get out of it because he has a fleet of lawyers. But I wish and hope that this time, the Indian government will succeed,"" Hariprasad added.He also pointed out that over 100 franchises were allegedly defrauded by Choksi, many of which had filed cases in various Indian cities.""Even I got his arrest warrant from Bangalore police, but nothing really happened as he was smart enough to get away from the clutches of law,"" the PNB scam whistleblower said.Highlighting the challenges ahead, he said, ""The legal system in India is undoubtedly very great, but the extradition process depends on the country we are dealing with. This case is not going to be easy, as he has so much money.""Hariprasad had first raised red flags about the scam in a letter to the Prime Minister's Office on July 26, 2016, flagging suspicious entries in balance sheets and warning of a potential large-scale fraud.Meanwhile, sources confirmed that Choksi was arrested in Belgium on Saturday after local authorities verified his presence. Preparations are reportedly under way for his extradition to India.The Belgian authorities confirmed the arrest of Choksi and released an official statement: ""Mehul Choksi was arrested on Saturday, April 12, 2025. He is being detained in anticipation of further judicial proceedings. Access to his legal counsel has been assured. The Belgian Federal Public Service of Justice can confirm that the Indian authorities have introduced an extradition request for Choksi.""On the arrest of Choksi by Belgian authorities, former director of ED, said, ""This is an extradition process and in any country, it can be said that it happens in two stages. The first stage is to accept the extradition request politically and bureaucratically. His arrest means they have accepted that they have to execute this extradition request. Now in the court, the Belgian government will fight on our behalf to bring him to India.""However, Choksi is preparing for a legal battle. His defence team is expected to seek bail and challenge the extradition process. The legal team has cited his health condition and other factors as grounds for opposing the request.Choksi fled India on January 2, 2018. He is wanted by the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for his alleged role in nearly Rs 14,000 crore Punjab National Bank fraud, along with his nephew, Nirav Modi.","Punjab National Bank scam whistleblower Hariprasad SV raises doubts on fugitive businessman Mehul Choksi's chances of being extradited to India.

The sectoral indices showed strong performance in Nifty metal, consumer durables, and oil and gas.The week had commenced with a substantial decline on Monday, as global markets responded adversely to the US administration's declaration of reciprocal tariffs. This action sparked concerns about a potential trade conflict and caused investor unease. The circumstances deteriorated when China issued its own counter-measures, further affecting investor confidence globally.The markets subsequently regained stability after the US chose to postpone tariff implementation for all nations except China. This decision provided relief to international markets, including India, leading to price recovery in subsequent trading sessions.Domestically, Indian indices benefited from the Reserve Bank of India's latest policy statement.

NEW DELHI: Terminal 2 of Delhi Airport will be shut for repairs on April 15 for about four months and Terminal 1 will finally start operating at 100% capacity. Airlines operating flights from this all-domestic terminal will shift to T1. These include IndiGo and Akasa among others.In a statement, IndiGo said "" effective April 15, 2025, all its flights arriving to and departing from Terminal 2 will operate to/from Terminal 1. With implementation of this change, IndiGo will now operate from Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 of Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi.""IndiGo says it has ""taken proactive measures to ensure that its customers are well-informed about this change. The airline is reaching out to all passengers and their respective travel agents through SMS, calls, and emails to notify them. IndiGo recommends retrieving PNR on the airline's website or mobile app to check departure / arrival terminal before heading to the airport.""Akasa said: ""Starting April 15, 2025, all our flights to and from Delhi will operate from Terminal 1 (1D) of Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi.Please your check your flight status before proceeding to the airport.""Delhi Airport said: ""Attention Passengers: Effective April 15, 2025 (0001 hrs), all flights currently operating from Terminal 2 will shift to Terminal 1 until further notice.""Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) has begun conducting trials for transferring check-in baggage of connecting passengers between T3 (IGIA’s only international terminal) and the all domestic T1. This week T1 will get fully operational and then T2 will be shut for repairs. However with an air train still a few years away, transfers between T3 & T1 — at a time when connecting traffic is on the rise thanks to massive network expansion by Air India group and IndiGo — remain a major pain point for passengers. To make domestic-international or vice versa transfers between T3 & T1 little less painful, DIAL plans to ensure baggage of some connecting passengers gets transferred on the airside without them being required to carry the same with them on buses.As of now, international arrivals at Delhi airport have to complete their immigration and customs clearance have to check-in baggage again for connecting flights. “DIAL is conducting trials for smooth transfer of cabin baggage from T3 to T1 for passengers arriving from international destinations and having a connecting flight from T1,” DIAL CEO Videh Kumar Jaipuriar said last Friday. Jaipuriar said once the new system is implemented, then, after customs clearance, passengers will not have to carry baggage to T1. They can drop the baggage at T3, and the airline concerned will transfer it to T1 through the airside, Jaipuriar said.DIAL has told the civil aviation ministry that transfer of passengers for connecting flights from T1 to T3 will be completed in 120 minutes. The number of transfer traffic is expected to rise and with the 7-km apart T1 & T3 not connected by an air train, smooth connections are a distant dream as of now. “We have committed to Govt that it will be ensured passengers coming out of T1 can board a flight in T3 in 120 minutes,” he said.",Terminal 2 of Delhi Airport will be shut for repairs on April 15 for about four months.

IHCL’s rapid adoption of asset-light strategy & superior 70-75% EBITDA margins drove 18% CAGR in mngt contract rooms (FY19-24), vs 2% for owned hotels. Expected to account for ~85% of planned room additions in FY26/27. Roots Corp. (RCL), repositioned as lean luxe, achieved 13% revenue and 55% EBITDA CAGRs (FY19-24). Plans for 874 Ginger rooms by FY27 and Qmin integration further leverage managed hotels to sustain growth. New growth segments, Chambers & Taj Sats are expected to contribute 12-14% of IH’s total revenue by FY30E (vs. 2% currently). We estimate adj. PAT to grow at 26% CAGR over FY24–27. With plans to add 8,091 rooms by FY27 (34,521 total keys), it reinforces its position as India’s largest hospitality player, targeting ~65% luxury room share.Oil price decline due to OPEC+ output hike and US tariffs is likely to improve HPCL’s gross marketing margins, which along with the ₹50 price hike imposed by the Center, will help offset ₹76b LPG under-recoveries. Key triggers include the demerger and potential listing of the lubricant business, commissioning of the bottom upgrade unit in Q4FY25, and Rajasthan refinery launch in CY25.For 4Q we expect refining throughput at 6.6mmt (+14% YoY), marketing sales volume at 12.5mmt (+1% YoY), expected GRM at USD5.5/bbl, and gross marketing margin at ₹4.6/lit. With expected FY26 RoE of 17%, current valuations look attractive.","According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting April 14, 2025) are Indian Hotels and HPCL.

Goldman Sachs has a ‘buy’ recommendation on TCS but has cut target price to Rs 3,960 after the software major’s Jan-March results. Analysts said that both revenue growth and EBIT margins were marginally below the brokerage’s expectations. The company’s flat headcount and deferred wage hike suggest an uncertain growth outlook. TCS is seeing delays in decision-making, with some project ramp downs, and discretionary spends.JP Morgan maintained its ‘overweight’ rating on Tata Steel with a target price of Rs 180. Analysts said the company’s Netherlands transformation program to target Euro 500-million-plus cost savings over FY26-27 is a positive development against a tough macro backdrop. Investor focus in the near term likely remains on the second order impact of demand destruction. They believe Tata’s structural cost reduction initiatives should not be ignored.Motilal Oswal Financial Services has upgraded Interglobe Aviation (Indigo) to ‘buy’ with the target price at Rs 5,550. Calling the airline the ‘best domestic consumption play’, analysts said that the upgrade came as they believed that benign Brent crude prices amid the ongoing geopolitical turmoil and favourable domestic demand bode well for the company.Investec maintained its ‘buy’ recommendation on Sun Pharmaceuticals with a target price of Rs 1,980. Analysts said that the US Federal Circuit court has lifted a preliminary injunction on Leqselvi’s launch in the country, paving the path for its launch. Court case with Incyte shall continue and in case Incyte wins, Sun Pharma could be liable for damages. Believe Incyte’s incentives to settle are low and cannot conclude if they are more willing to settle now. Over the next 2-3 years, Leqselvi’s ramp up is likely to be slow around sub $100 million in sales.Kotak Institutional Equities has downgraded Muthoot Finance to ‘add’ from ‘buy’ and cut target price to Rs 2,250 from Rs 2,400. Analysts cut their estimates by 10% after RBI’s draft guidelines on gold loans potentially reduce maximum LTV for gold loan NBFCs, increase competition from moneylenders and/or reduce IRR on loans. While they await to see the final form of the guidelines, they have moderated their growth and margin assumptions. They remain constructive on gold loan business, but expect an overhang of regulatory changes to temper stock performance.","Goldman Sachs has a ‘buy’ recommendation on TCS but has cut target price to Rs 3,960.

DU College Cow Dung Incident: Principal Applies Cow Dung on Classroom Walls to Combat Heat​,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/to-combat-delhi-heat-du-principal-applies-cow-dung-on-classroom-walls-sparks-debate/articleshow/120266803.cms,"Lakshmibai College's principal, Pratyush Vatsala, applied cow dung to classroom walls in Block C to combat the heat, aiming for an eco-friendly solution amidst infrastructure issues

Poll Should the college invest more in infrastructure improvements instead of traditional methods? No, traditional methods are valuable Yes, infrastructure is crucial

NEW DELHI: In a move that has both amused and bewildered many, the principal of Delhi University's Lakshmibai College has taken a hands-on-rather, a hands-dirty - approach to cooling down classrooms. Quite literally. To combat the scorching heat in the college's ageing Block C, she personally applied cow dung to the walls of a classroom, a method rooted in traditional Indian practices believed to regulate indoor temperatures.The act, documented in a video shared by the principal, Pratyush Vatsala, herself in the college's internal teachers' group, was intended to showcase a return to age-old, eco-friendly methods in the face of infrastructure limitations. But what was meant to be an internal update quickly escaped the bounds of WhatsApp, landing on social media feeds and setting off a firestorm of reactions ranging from admiration to disbelief.In the video, Vatsala is seen working alongside other staff members, spreading the cow dung with her own hands on the walls of a classroom. According to teachers, the effort was part of an initiative to make classrooms more comfortable for teaching, especially in Block C, which is one of the oldest structures on campus, perched above the canteen and said to be hot during summers.However, the move sparked a wider debate among students and faculty who argue that the root problem lies in long-standing infrastructural neglect. Many classrooms are overcrowded, lack cross-ventilation, and have minimal functioning fans. There are no coolers or air conditioners, and even the washrooms are poorly maintained.While the college recently saw vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh lay the foundation for a new block, the older buildings remain neglected. This has only added to the frustration. ""Some rooms are definitely hot, but no one asked for cow dung,"" a student said, adding in the same breath, ""We just need proper fans-or coolers, at least.""When TOI reached out for a comment, the principal said, ""It's part of a research proposal by faculty.""The principal's unconventional solution may stem from centuries-old knowledge - cow dung has long been used in rural India to cool homes and repel insects-but its application in a modern, urban college setting has triggered a debate.Although cow dung has traditionally been used in rural India as a cooling and insulating material, its use in a modern, urban academic setting has sparked questions about practicality and symbolism. In rural areas, a mix of cow dung and mud is commonly used to coat floors and walls, helping to regulate temperature while offering cooling, antibacterial and insect-repellent properties. Some African communities also use similar techniques, giving this practice global rural roots.Even Union minister Nitin Gadkari previously launched a paint made from cow dung, calling it eco-friendly and non-toxic. Yet experts agree that such materials have little relevance in cement-heavy urban architecture. Cow dung, with its low compressive strength, can't replace modern cooling systems in concrete structures. According to experts, in Lakshmibai College-with old buildings, poor ventilation, and large rooms-the absence of fans or coolers can't be substituted with a cow dung coating . The episode may not have offered the most practical application, but it has reignited a larger dialogue-one about sustainability, innovation, and how we balance tradition with modern demands.","Lakshmibai College principal Pratyush Vatsala applied cow dung to classroom walls in Block C to combat the heat.

Societies will have to place their request at the ward office by submitting proof of their regular consumption and paying the fee.The civic body's move made Mumbai Water Tankers Association dig in its heels as it warned that the stir will be extended to Navi Mumbai and Mira-Bhayander.This is the first time that BMC has invoked the Act—usually used in times of natural disasters—in such a situation owing to fears that with non-potable water not available, the pressure would fall on drinking water supply. Officials said with the advent of summer, higher dependence on potable water could lead to faster depletion of existing sources. BMC supplies 3,900 million litres per day (MLD) of potable water to the city and private tankers provide an additional 200 MLD.Confirming that the Act has been invoked, BMC commissioner Bhushan Gagrani said, ""Filling of tankers is generally observed on specific private premises with high yielding wells. We will be requisitioning them."" In a statement, BMC said the decision has been taken keeping broader public interest in mind.Ankur Sharma, Mumbai Water Tankers Association's spokesperson, pointed out that if BMC takes over tankers and wells, then it, too, will have to seek an NOC from Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) ""whose conditions are not acceptable to us"", referring to the notices issued by BMC to owners of private wells directing them to obtain NOCs from CGWA, which had triggered the strike. The notices have been stayed till June 15.The city's dependence on private tankers has grown over the years, particularly in newly developed areas where BMC's water supply is insufficient. These tankers also typically cater to star hotels, large housing societies, malls and food courts. With the strike disrupting even these supplemental supplies, concerns have been raised about the impact on daily water access in several parts of the city.BMC's SOP on streamlining water distribution states that the number of tankers, along with drivers, cleaners and necessary office staff, will be requisitioned based on the usual demand and determined in advance. A joint notification will be issued by BMC's disaster management and legal departments, following which the transport commissioner will assign the required vehicles and personnel to the respective ward offices by the evening.Each ward office will see the formation of operational teams led by assistant commissioners and comprising officials such as assistant engineer (water works), pest control officer, medical officer (health), accounts officer, regional transport inspector and police inspector, according to the SOP. These teams will function under the supervision of the zonal deputy or additional municipal commissioners. The number of transport inspectors required at each ward, depending on the number of tankers and water filling points, will be assessed by the executive health officer and the transport commissioner will be apprised of it for deployment of adequate manpower.The SOP also states that housing societies in need of tanker water must place their request at the citizen facilitation centre (CFC) of their ward office and pay the applicable fee. This receipt will be acknowledged at water filling stations. Housing societies must also submit proof of their regular daily water consumption and usual tanker requirements, as provided by their existing suppliers. Once the request is registered, a tanker will be dispatched to the designated filling point and upon filling, it will proceed to the respective society. Local police stations will provide security at all filling points to maintain order.The housing societies will be required to pay the same amount they typically pay private tanker operators, along with a 25% administrative surcharge. This can be paid either in cash or via UPI at CFCs. On completion of delivery, tanker operators must submit the delivery receipt to the BMC team. Based on this submission, the accounts officer will process payment to the tanker operator.The operational teams formed under this SOP will also assign subordinate officers to ensure effective implementation. Zonal deputy or additional municipal commissioners, along with their counterparts in Mumbai police, will be responsible for monitoring compliance and smooth functioning. They have also been authorised to make minor local adjustments, if necessary, to the SOP, in consultation with the additional municipal commissioner.The funds required to implement the SOP will be disbursed by the accounts officer to the assistant commissioner, and all expenditure has to be properly documented and accounted for.","Mumbai Water Tankers Association dig in its heels as it warns that the stir will be extended to Navi Mumbai and Mira-Bhayander.

Investor sentiment steady

Commodities

US stocks rallied initial hours of trading as investors welcomed a surprise move by President Donald Trump to temporarily exempt key technology products from new tariffs. The exemption, which includes smartphones, computers, and semiconductors gave a major lift to tech-heavy indices and set a bullish tone for the start of the week.As of 1:15 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 135.58 points at 40,348.29, gaining 0.34%, while the S&P 500 added 19.32 points or 0.36%, trading at 5,382.68. The Nasdaq Composite saw a more modest rise of 0.1%, standing at 16,741.32.Markets pushed higher despite sobering data from the New York Fed’s consumer expectations survey, which revealed that Americans now assign a 44% probability to the unemployment rate being higher a year from now — the most pessimistic view since April 2020, in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. The survey also noted deteriorating sentiment toward the stock market, hitting its lowest point since June 2022, and rising concerns over near-term inflation.Commodities took a hit, with gold falling $20.60 or 0.63% to $3,224, while oil declined 0.99% to $60.89 per barrel, reflecting broader market uncertainty and possible concerns over global demand.Meanwhile, bond yields slipped as investors sought safety.The yield on the US 10-Year Treasury fell sharply by 8.8 basis points to 4.405%, its largest one-day drop in recent weeks. The EUR/USD exchange rate edged lower to 1.134, while the VIX — Wall Street ’s so-called fear gauge — dropped 10.12% to 33.76, indicating a short-term easing in market volatility.Meanwhile, European markets surged in early trade: Germany’s DAX climbed 2.5%, France’s CAC 40 rose 2.3%, and London’s FTSE 100 added 1.9%, as per news agency AP. The rally was driven by renewed confidence in the tech sector, with investors anticipating short-term stability in supply chains and production costs.In Asia, the momentum was equally robust. Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed 1.2% higher, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 2.4%, and Shanghai’s Composite Index gained 0.8%. Notably, South Korean tech majors like Samsung Electronics and Advantest posted strong gains, benefitting from their deep links to the global semiconductor industry.China’s March export growth, up 12.4% year-on-year, added to the region’s positive tone. The strong trade data underscored resilience in manufacturing, even amid ongoing tariff friction.The US exemption announcement came shortly after China imposed tariffs of up to 125% on US goods in retaliation for escalating US duties, which have reached 145% on certain Chinese products. Though the latest move was framed as a temporary reprieve, President Trump emphasized over the weekend that no country—“especially not China”—would escape future tariffs.Administration officials confirmed that new levies, especially on strategic goods like semiconductors, would be unveiled within weeks. Trump cited national security concerns and reiterated the goal of reshoring chip and pharmaceutical production.Markets responded positively to the breathing room, despite lingering uncertainty. Last Friday, Wall Street closed on a high note: the S&P 500 rose 1.8%, the Dow added 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.1%. Strong quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley helped bolster confidence.The 10-year US Treasury yield, which had surged above 4.58% last week, eased to 4.44% Monday morning. While the bond market remains jittery, the retreat in yields suggests investors are cautiously rebalancing after sharp risk-off moves.Currency markets also reflected shifting dynamics. The US dollar dipped slightly, with the yen strengthening to 143.16 per dollar. The euro firmed to $1.1388, and the British pound advanced to $1.3184.Oil prices ticked higher on improved demand outlooks. West Texas Intermediate rose 1.0% to $62.10, while Brent crude added 0.9% to $65.36. The gains reflect optimism that easing trade friction, even if temporary, could support industrial activity.Gold, often a refuge in volatile times, edged down by $9 to $3,235 per ounce, as traders rotated back into equities and risk assets.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 135.58 points at 40,348.29, gaining 0.34%.

China warns UK government to treat Chinese owners of British Steel fairly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-warns-uk-government-to-treat-chinese-owners-of-british-steel-fairly/articleshow/120279634.cms,"Photo credit- AP

China has warned the UK government to treat the Chinese owners of British Steel fairly or risk undermining investor confidence in the country, two days after British authorities took control of the company.China’s Foreign Ministry made the comment on Monday as government-appointed managers raced to prevent British Steel from shutting down the last two blast furnaces in Britain that make so-called virgin steel from raw materials.Parliament on Saturday passed legislation authorizing the government to take control of the company and its Scunthorpe steelworks from Jingye Group , which has owned British Steel since 2020. Jingye still owns the company but British authorities have taken control of day-to-day operations.“We hope the British government treats Chinese enterprises investing and operating in the U.K. fairly and justly, protects their legitimate rights and interests, and avoids politicizing and over-securitizing economic and trade cooperation, so as not to affect the confidence of Chinese enterprises in investing and cooperating in the U.K.,” Foreign Ministry spokeperson Lin Jian said during the weekly press conference in Beijing.The U.K. government on Monday installed a new executive team at British Steel with the aim of ensuring “consistent and professional leadership” of the Scunthorpe works in northeastern England, British Steel said in a statement.Two longtime British Steel executives, Allan Bell and Lisa Coulson, were named as the company’s interim chief executive and chief commercial officer. The appointments were approved by Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds.Bell, who has worked at Scunthorpe for 14 years, said his main goal was to ensure continued steel production at the plant.“Our immediate priorities are securing the raw materials we need to continue blast furnace operations, ensuring we have the dedicated personnel to run those furnaces, and maintaining the highest levels of health and safety for our workforce,” Bell said in the statement.Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday took the dramatic step of recalling Parliament from its spring recess to pass emergency legislation authorizing the government to take control of British Steel. Authorities were concerned about the plant’s future after Jingye stopped ordering the iron ore and coking coal needed to keep the furnaces operating.Once blast furnaces are shut down, it is difficult and expensive to restart them, raising concerns that Britain might lose the ability to make high-quality virgin steel needed by builders and railroads as the government tries to spur economic growth. Other British steelmakers are already in the process of shifting to electric arc furnaces that make steel from scrap metal.",China has warned the UK government to treat the Chinese owners of British Steel fairly or risk undermining investor confidence in the country.

Tech stocks lead gains

Market volatility eases, but trade tensions linger

World markets advanced sharply on Monday after US President Donald Trump announced a temporary exemption on electronics—including smartphones, laptops, and computer chips—from new tariffs, offering relief to technology companies and boosting investor confidence.In early European trading, Germany’s DAX surged 2.4% to 20,857.54, France’s CAC 40 rose 2% to 7,245.28, and the UK’s FTSE 100 climbed 1.8% to reach 8,104.83. US futures also pointed to a positive start, with the S&P 500 gaining 1.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.9%, according to new agency AP.Asia’s markets logged solid gains, driven largely by optimism in the tech sector. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.2% to 33,982.36, while South Korea’s Kospi gained 1% to 2,455.89. Shares in major tech firms surged—Tokyo Electron climbed 1.4%, Advantest jumped 4.9%, and Samsung Electronics advanced 1.8%.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rallied 2.4% to 21,417.40. The Shanghai Composite rose a more modest 0.8% to 3,262.81, buoyed by new government data showing a 12.4% surge in China’s exports in March compared to the same month a year earlier.Trump’s move to temporarily exempt key electronics from import duties came after China announced a steep tariff increase on US goods—raising some rates to 125% in response to Washington’s previous actions.In a statement, China’s Ministry of Commerce called Trump’s exemption “a small step” and urged the US to cancel all reciprocal tariffs entirely.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 also joined the rally, gaining 1.3% to close at 7,748.60. However, Taiwan’s Taiex slipped by 0.1%, reflecting concerns over possible upcoming US tariffs specifically targeting chip exports—a sector critical to the island’s economy. Trump has stated that new chip tariffs are expected to be detailed “over the next week.”Despite Monday’s optimism, global markets remain on edge over the ongoing trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies. Analysts warn that prolonged friction could lead to wider economic damage, potentially triggering a global slowdown. Trump’s recent 90-day pause on select tariffs—excluding China—has temporarily eased fears, but uncertainty continues to cloud investor sentiment.Last Friday, Wall Street closed with strong gains. The S&P 500 jumped 1.8%, the Dow climbed 1.6%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 2.1%, helped by better-than-expected earnings from major US banks. JPMorgan Chase reported a 4% rise, Morgan Stanley added 1.4%, while Wells Fargo dipped 1%.Bond markets also saw significant movement. The 10-year US Treasury yield stood at 4.44% early Monday, down from Friday’s peak of 4.58%, but still significantly higher than the 4.01% level just a week earlier. Rising yields have raised concerns over potential sell-offs and broader economic instability, particularly as investors gauge the implications of ongoing trade policies.Oil prices reversed earlier losses, with US benchmark crude up 63 cents to $62.13 per barrel and Brent crude, the global standard, rising 62 cents to $65.38 per barrel. Meanwhile, currency markets saw the US dollar weaken to 143.25 Japanese yen from 143.91 yen, while the euro strengthened to $1.1382 from $1.1320.Gold, a traditional safe haven for investors, slipped about $9 early Monday to trade at $3,235 an ounce, as market fears eased slightly amid the tariff reprieve for electronics.","Germany’s DAX surged 2.4% to 20,857.54, France's CAC 40 rose 2% to 7,245.28, and the UK's FTSE 100 climbed 1.8% to 8,104.83.

China’s exports surged 12.4% in March compared to a year earlier, beating expectations as companies rushed to ship goods ahead of steep new US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, according to government data released Monday. Imports, meanwhile, dropped by 4.3% as global trade conditions remained volatile.In the first quarter of 2025, exports from the world’s second-largest economy rose 5.8%, while imports fell 7%. The trade balance with the United States remained a focal point, with China posting a $27.6 billion surplus in March, as exports to the US rose 4.5%. For the quarter, China’s surplus with the US reached $76.6 billion.The export boost comes as China faces 145% tariffs on many of its shipments to the US, following recent revisions in American trade policy. Yet, Chinese exporters found strong momentum in other regions, particularly Southeast Asia, where exports jumped nearly 17% in March year-on-year. Exports to African markets also climbed more than 11%.Vietnam emerged as a key partner, with Chinese exports rising nearly 17% in March compared to last year, though imports from Vietnam declined by 2.7%.Chinese President Xi Jinping was en route to Vietnam on Monday as part of a broader regional tour including Malaysia and Cambodia.While the trip was likely scheduled in advance, it took on added significance amid rising tensions with Washington. Several Asian nations, like China, are also bracing for potential new tariffs, although the US announced a 90-day delay in enforcing these measures last week.Despite the external challenges, Chinese customs spokesperson Lyu Daliang expressed cautious optimism. ""China is facing a complex and severe external situation,"" Lyu said, ""but the sky will not fall."" He emphasized China's continued importance as a global market, noting that it has been the world’s second-largest importer for 16 consecutive years, with its share of global imports rising from 8% to 10.5%.""At present and in the future, China's import growth space is huge,"" Lyu added.

Asian tech stocks climb amid mixed signals on tariff reprieve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-tech-stocks-climb-amid-mixed-signals-on-tariff-reprieve/articleshow/120266810.cms,"Representative Image

Technology stocks rose after the Trump administration announced a pause in tariffs for phones, computers and consumer electronics, though officials later downplayed the reprieve.Shares of Apple Inc. climbed more than 6% on the Robinhood trading platform. Nasdaq 100 futures jumped more than 2.3% in early Asian trading hours Monday before halving the advance.In Taiwan, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. gained as much as 7.1%. South Korean parts maker LG Innotek Co. , which gets the bulk of its revenue from Apple, surged as much as 8.9%. Nvidia Corp. supplier Advantest Corp. rose 6.3% in Tokyo. A gauge of Asian tech stocks climbed as much as 2.6%, boosting the regional benchmark.“We are in a much better spot than Friday” and tech investors “can now breathe a sigh of relief,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note. “But still there is mass uncertainty, chaos and confusion about the next steps ahead with all focus on China tariff negotiations being front and center”Late Friday, US Customs and Border Protection published measures excluding such products from the 125% China tariff and baseline 10% global tariff on nearly all other countries.President Donald Trump and other officials pledged over the weekend that tech tariffs are still coming, however. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted it was only a pause, though the new tech levies will almost certainly be lower than the 125% rate on China. Chip tariffs are “coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick added.“I think it is ‘net’ reprieve, as the bet that electronics will still be less than the 125% reciprocal on China and that companies get to build buffer now,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank. The biggest beneficiary in Asia around this news will likely be China “temporarily, but I would not take too much solace in that as the guns are still trained on China.”Key Chinese stocks to watch include Luxshare Precision Industry Co. and Lens Technology Co., which get more than half of their sales from Apple. Hong Kong-listed smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. will also be in focus.","Shares of Apple Inc. climbed more than 6% on the Robinhood trading platform.

Marshmallows instead of eggs? Why Jet-Puffed’s Easter decorating kit is gaining buzz amid soaring egg prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/marshmallows-instead-of-eggs-why-jet-puffeds-easter-decorating-kit-is-gaining-buzz-amid-soaring-egg-prices/articleshow/120257795.cms,"AI generated image

With egg prices hitting record highs just ahead of Easter, some families — and even a few bunnies — may be looking for more affordable alternatives to keep the holiday tradition alive. One sweet solution? Marshmallows Priced around $2 a bag, marshmallows are emerging as a cost-friendly, dyeable substitute for eggs this season. Capitalizing on the trend, Kraft Heinz-owned Jet-Puffed has launched its first-ever “Dip and Decorate Dozen” kit — a pastel-themed marshmallow decorating set designed to bring Easter fun without the egg-spense, as reported CNN.In a press release, Jet-Puffed described the kit as a “festive, mess-free twist on egg decorating.” Priced at just $1.99, it includes six vibrant color packs, mini tongs for dipping, decorating pens, and a 24-ounce bag of extra-large marshmallows — roughly the same size as jumbo eggs. The kits are available exclusively on Walmart’s website and will be restocked daily ahead of the holiday.Jet-Puffed said the idea came in response to spiking egg prices, which have prompted many households to seek creative and budget-friendly alternatives.“Parents are looking for ways to keep the time-honored tradition alive without breaking the bank,” the company noted.According to the Consumer Price Index, retail egg prices jumped 5.6% last week to a record average of $6.23 per dozen — nearly 60% higher than a year ago. The rise follows an avian flu outbreak that killed about 30 million egg-laying hens this year.However, there may be signs of relief. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that wholesale egg prices have dropped to around $3 a dozen, as the bird flu outbreak has largely been contained. Still, the USDA cautions that it may take several weeks for those lower prices to reach store shelves.Consumer demand for eggs has also declined, contributing to the dip in wholesale prices. “Demand from egg products manufacturers is mostly light as many have been able to take advantage of a sluggish carton market to build supplies,” the USDA report stated.",Kraft Heinz-owned Jet-Puffed has launched its first-ever “Dip and Decorate Dozen’ kit.

"Trump’s tariff may shrink global trade by 3%, shift exports to India, Brazil: UN expert",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-tariff-may-shrink-global-trade-by-3-shift-exports-to-india-brazil-un-expert/articleshow/120233711.cms,"The new US tariff regime could shrink global trade by 3 per cent and significantly shift export flows from traditional markets like the US and China to emerging economies such as India, Canada, and Brazil, according to a top United Nations trade official, as PTI reported.Pamela Coke-Hamilton, Executive Director of the International Trade Centre, warned on Friday in Geneva that US President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff hikes—followed by China’s retaliation—are likely to cause long-term disruptions in international commerce and economic integration.“Global trade could shrink by 3 per cent, with significant long-term shifts in trade patterns and economic integration,” Coke-Hamilton told PTI. “Exports from Mexico—which have been highly impacted—are shifting from markets such as the US , China, Europe and even other Latin American countries, with modest gains instead in Canada and Brazil, and to a lesser extent, India.”The White House last week announced steep tariffs on imports, including a 145 per cent levy on Chinese goods. A 90-day pause on ""reciprocal tariffs"" has been granted to most countries, but not to China, which responded by imposing its own 125 per cent tariff on US imports.According to PTI, the ongoing tariff war is causing widespread reorientation of supply chains. Vietnamese exports are being redirected away from the US , Mexico and China, with notable increases to the EU, Korea, and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions.ALSO READ | Trump’s tariff rattles US importers; Woldenberg’s CEO calls it 'end of days' Coke-Hamilton cited the apparel sector as a key example. “Textiles is a top industry in terms of economic activity and employment for developing countries,” she said. Bangladesh, the world’s second-largest apparel exporter, would be hit with a 37 per cent reciprocal tariff if US measures proceed, potentially slashing $3.3 billion from its annual US exports by 2029.S he added that for developing nations to withstand such shocks—be it from trade policy shifts, pandemics, or climate disasters—they must prioritise diversification, value addition, and regional integration.“There are opportunities for developing countries not just to navigate times of uncertainty, but to proactively prepare for the long haul,” she said.Early economic modelling, developed with the French economics research institute CEPII, indicates that even before the latest wave of tariffs and China’s countermeasures, global GDP could be reduced by 0.7 per cent by 2040. Countries such as Mexico, China, Thailand, and nations in Southern Africa are among the most affected, along with the United States itself.Meanwhile, the Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) in Washington has warned of broader geopolitical implications. Wendy Cutler, ASPI Vice President and Managing Director, said, “With China’s announcement of further tariff hikes against US imports, it’s clear that hopes that China would blink first in this trade war are misplaced. China is in for the long haul.”Cutler noted that while Beijing may have reached the limit of symmetrical tariff retaliation, it likely has “other tools in its arsenal” that could be activated if tensions escalate.“The steep tariffs now in place—145 per cent for Chinese imports into the US and 125 per cent for US imports to China—virtually halt all goods trade between the two largest economies in the world,” she said.ASPI’s Vice President of International Security and Diplomacy, Daniel Russel, said Chinese President Xi Jinping is staying calm amid the crisis, waiting for Trump’s tariff policy to falter under domestic pressure.“He’s betting that Trump’s tariff tantrum will collapse under the weight of the US market response,” Russel said. “By declaring it will ‘ignore’ future US tariff hikes, Beijing is not trying to win the trade war—it’s trying to outlast it and outmanoeuvre Trump.”Russel added that China is pursuing a longer-term strategic advantage by shoring up ties with Southeast Asia, expanding its diplomatic clout, and subtly pressuring US allies. “Xi’s Southeast Asia tour is part of a strategy to reinforce economic partnerships while Washington lashes out and alienates its partners,” he said.","US President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff hikes are likely to cause long- term disruptions in international commerce and economic integration.

For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of carbon use per year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

"Crypto isn’t dead, it’s evolving rapidly to create a new world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-isnt-dead-its-evolving-rapidly-to-create-a-new-world/articleshow/101324954.cms,"Regulatory landscape



There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online. “Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN



NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance.

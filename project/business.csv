Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices extended their pullback for the second consecutive week amid strong global market momentum. The Reserve Bank of India’s recent dovish stance, aimed at fostering credit growth, provided crucial support to market sentiment. In its latest policy decision, the RBI kept the repo rate steady at 5.5%, signaling a cautious but accommodative approach.After a robust up move, where the Nifty surged over 600 points within just four sessions from 24,588 to 25,220, the index has entered a phase of consolidation over the past two sessions. Moving forward, the Nifty needs to decisively close above the 25,220 marks for a meaningful pullback to take shape. Failing this, the index is likely to continue oscillating within the 25,220 to 24,700 range, driven largely by stock-specific movements ahead of the Q2FY26 earnings season.On the upside, a sustained move above Tuesday’s high of 25,220 would pave the way for further gains towards the 25,400-25,500 levels, where the trendline resistance connecting the major highs of June and September 2025 lies.On the downside, strong support is seen between 24,800 and 24,700, marked by the confluence of the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally from 24,588 to 25,220.Key Monitorables Going Forward:Overall, the market appears poised for cautious consolidation, supported by favorable macro factors but awaiting clearer direction from earnings and global cues.Bank Nifty displayed notable relative strength throughout the week, outperforming Nifty as buying momentum returned across major banking stocks post RBI monetary policy meeting. The strong up move in the last 2 weeks reflects renewed bullish sentiment, indicating that the banking sector is regaining leadership. Sustained buying momentum could further strengthen investor confidence and drive additional upside in the coming weeks.Bank Nifty after a 2300 points up-move in just 6 sessions is witnessing consolidation in the last 2 sessions. We expect the index to consolidate in the range of 56,500-55,500 thus forming a base for the next leg of up move.On the higher side a move above Tuesday’s high of 56500 would open further upside towards the all-time high of 57,300-57,600 in the coming weeks.On the downside support is placed at 55,500-55,000 levels being the confluence of the 20- & 50-days EMA and the 61.8% retracement of the last up move (54,227-56,502). We believe bias remains positive and dips should be used as a buying opportunity.Jayaswal Neco Industries (JNIL’s) strong captive iron ore resource base in Chhattisgarh provides a structural advantage in securing raw material supplies, with mining leases valid through 2052–2055 and scalable production potential up to 4 MTPA. Expansion across the value chain, including a 1.5 MTPA pellet plant and a new beneficiation facility, positions the company to capture higher value-added margins and operational efficiencies. The upcoming washery expansion, expected by October 2025, is set to deliver annual cost savings of ₹800–900 million, further improving profitability.In parallel, JNIL’s proactive debt refinancing of ₹23 billion with Tata Capital marks a pivotal balance sheet improvement, lowering borrowing costs from 17.5% to 12.5% and extending repayment tenure to 72 months. This move will enhance cash flow visibility, strengthen liquidity, and improve credit metrics. Collectively, these operational and financial initiatives support a positive outlook on JNIL’s earnings trajectory and reinforce confidence in the company’s long-term value creation potential.The stock has confirmed a breakout from an inverse head and shoulders pattern, decisively moving above its falling trendline resistance.After a phase of prolonged consolidation, it is now breaking out of its trading range, indicating a potential shift in trend.Key supports are placed at ₹240 and ₹225, while on the upside, immediate resistance is seen around ₹300 being the recent range breakout. The breakout is further validated by rising volumes, reinforcing bullish momentum.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 10, 2025 are Jayaswal Neco Industries, and Bank of Baroda. The Reserve Bank of India’s recent dovish stance, aimed at fostering credit growth, provided crucial support to market sentiment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124442307,imgsize-80346,width-400,resizemode-4/top-stocks-to-buy.jpg"

Drama In Kuwait: EU Bigwig BLAMES Gulf States For Bloc's Failure In Isolating Russia | Watch



What Nayara is doing to sustain operations?





Nayara Energy, the Indian refinery with major Russian ownership, is scrambling to sustain operations after being hit by European Union sanctions. The Russian-owned refinery, facing exclusion from many international markets due to severe EU sanctions implemented on July 18, has been compelled to redirect additional fuel towards domestic consumption whilst seeking alternative export destinations, amongst various necessary adaptations required by the EU restrictions.According to a Reuters report, from late August onwards, Nayara Energy's refinery has intensified its railway usage, dispatching two to three trains daily, each comprising 50 tanker cars to transport fuel to inland storage facilities. This is more than twice its previous railway utilisation for diesel and petrol transportation.Nayara's Russian ownership exemplifies the enduring close relationship between New Delhi and Moscow, a connection that positions India differently from Western allies.The government has found itself managing a delicate situation with Nayara's ongoing difficulties, providing essential operational support whilst being cautious not to trigger Western opposition, according to government and company officials quoted in the report. The administration's assistance includes allocation of tank wagons and authorisation for coastal vessels to transport the refinery's products.The refinery, with Russian state oil corporation Rosneft as its primary stakeholder, now sources its crude oil requirements exclusively from Russia, following the cessation of Iraqi and Saudi Arabian supplies post-EU sanctions. This dependency creates potential vulnerabilities should supply chains face disruption from enhanced sanctions or increased pressure from the Donald Trump administration.The UK government is evaluating dual strategies: supporting Nayara whilst being cognisant of mounting international pressure for stricter sanctions, according to Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies quoted in the report.""Long-term support might not be sustainable unless the whole global dynamics change - like a resolution between Russia and the U.S.A. or progress in Russia-Ukraine conflict,"" he said.The Mumbai-based Nayata holds significant influence in India's expanding fuel industry, contributing 8% of refined products output and managing over 6,500 petrol stations.The company has been compelled to decrease crude processing at its 400,000-barrel-per-day Vadinar refinery to 70-80% capacity - down from its previous 104% - as it encounters difficulties securing export customers for its fuel and banking institutions to process payments, according to sources familiar with refinery operations.Nayara adapted its operations by increasing railway transportation after sanctions impeded its coastal shipping and export capabilities, necessitating domestic distribution of its products, the Reuters report said.The refinery, lacking pipeline connectivity, received assistance from the government to access additional railcars and temporary permission to operate four coastal vessels, including the sanctioned Leruo and two vessels from the shadow fleet: the Garuda (Guinea-Bissau flag) and Chongchon (Djibouti flag), the report said.The company has requested governmental authorisation for two additional coastal vessels. Additionally, Nayara seeks official support to acquire equipment and materials, currently restricted by sanctions, for its maintenance closure initially planned for February. Sources indicate the company might postpone the shutdown until April whilst searching for alternative materials.""We are under constant threat,"" a senior company official said on condition of anonymity, citing the worry that vessels the company is now using could come under future Western sanctions.""We never anticipated that we would be hit so directly. Now, every day feels like firefighting.""Nayara - the name is a mix of Hindi and English for ""New Era"" - previously operated as Essar Oil before its 2017 acquisition by Rosneft alongside a consortium including Russian fund UCP and Trafigura, with the latter later divesting its stake.The company sourced oil from diverse nations until 2022. Subsequently, India increased its Russian oil imports at discounted rates following Western sanctions on Moscow post the Ukraine invasion, becoming the primary buyer of Russian seaborne crude.The refiner's primary concerns centre on maintenance issues and international payment capabilities, according to internal sources at Nayara quoted in the Reuters report.Since August, the state-owned SBI has halted processing of trade and forex transactions for Nayara, citing concerns about EU sanctions.Despite meetings between Nayara officials, finance ministry representatives and banks to address these banking complications, a resolution remains pending. This situation hampers the company's ability to conduct international crude imports and fuel exports, as per government sources.Recent shipments have been directed to the Middle East, Turkey, Taiwan and Brazil, with 16 cargo loads of diesel, gasoline and jet fuel transported via EU-sanctioned vessels, according to available data.","Nayara Energy, the Indian refinery with major Russian ownership, is scrambling to sustain operations after being hit by European Union sanctions.

SP Group places trust in 'transparency',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sp-group-places-trust-in-transparency/articleshow/124468219.cms,"Representative image





MUMBAI: Pushing for a public listing of Tata Sons , Shapoorji Pallonji Mistry on Friday said it was ""not merely a financial step - it is a moral and social imperative. ""Tata Trusts stand to benefit immensely from this (IPO) process. A transparent and publicly accountable Tata Sons would pave the way for a robust and equitable dividend policy, thereby ensuring sustained inflows to the Trusts.""Mistry's statement comes amid disagreements over governance and transparency among Tata Trusts trustees. The Tata Trusts board is vertically split, with Trusts chairman and Mistry's brother-in-law Noel Tata, vice chairmen Venu Srinivasan and Vijay Singh aligned on one side, while Mehli Mistry, a confidant of Ratan Tata and one of the executors and beneficiaries of Ratan Tata's estate, along with Darius Khambata, Jehangir Jehangir, and Pramit Jhaveri, represent the opposing faction. Tata Trusts want Tata Sons to remain private.In his statement on Friday, Mistry said, ""We firmly believe that listing this premier institution (Tata Sons) will not only uphold the spirit of transparency envisioned by its founding father, Jamsetji Tata, but also strengthen trust among all stakeholders.""The SP Group has pledged its entire Tata Sons stake as collateral to refinance a mounting debt burden of Rs 60,000 crore.Its next tranche of debt repayment is coming up in a few months. Any delay in Tata Sons' IPO will hurt SP as its financial pressures have deepened after Covid-19 pandemic.The RBI 's upper layer classification for Tata Sons required the holdco to be listed by Sept 30, 2025. But, there is no clarity on the future of Tata Sons' listing as the RBI is yet to decide on the holdco's request for an IPO exemption.Mistry said, ""As one of India's oldest business houses, we have full faith in the RBI, a constitutional and autonomous body, to take decisions grounded in the principles of equity, justice, and public interest."" He called for RBI's compliance timeline for Tata Sons to ""be viewed with the seriousness and sanctity that regulatory commitments deserve"".He further said, ""Our stance is guided by a simple yet profound belief -- transparency is the truest form of respect for both legacy and the future.""On July 28, 2025, the Trusts passed a resolution directing Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran to initiate a dialogue with SP to provide them with an exit from the holdco. That was the first time Tata Trusts formally directed the holdco to work out an exit route for SP. Previously, under the chairmanship of late Ratan Tata, Tata Trusts had rejected SP's exit requests, including a vertical split of Tata Sons' assets and liabilities in proportion to its 18.4% stake in the holdco. Tata Sons chairman is requested to ""explore all possible avenues to ensure that there is no change"" in Tata Sons' current status as an unlisted private company, read the July 28 resolution. It added that talks should be carried out ""with SP for providing an exit to them.""Despite the stance taken by Bombay House, SP group has been lobbying for an IPO. Mistry said public listing ""will unlock immense value for over 1.2 crore shareholders of listed Tata companies, who are indirect shareholders of Tata Sons"". ""Our position is not in conflict, but completely in consonance, with the ideals of Jamsetji Tata, whose vision was that of an enterprise serving the nation with openness, accountability, and compassion,"" Mistry said.","Shapoorji Pallonji Mistry is pushing for a public listing of Tata Sons.

Rural demand revs up: Tractor sales at new high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rural-demand-revs-up-tractor-sales-at-new-high/articleshow/124468207.cms,"Tractor sales at new high

Has the

GST rate cut

played a part as well?





CHENNAI: With a host of favourable factors driving demand, tractor volumes hit a historic high this September, and total domestic sales surpassed the half-a-million mark in the first half of the fiscal year for the first time.Domestic tractor sales stood at 1,46,180 units in September, compared with 1,00,542 units in Sept 2024, marking an increase of 45%. On a sequential basis, Sept sales more than doubled from 64,322 units in Aug 2025, according to data from the Tractor and Mechanisation Association.""Sept's record sales of over 1.5 lakh tractors were driven by a combination of factors - a good monsoon, increased kharif crop sowing, and higher minimum support prices for key crops, resulting in higher farm incomes. Sales following the GST 2.0 implementation, which took effect on September 22, and festive buying during Navaratri further boosted volumes,"" said Poonam Upadhyay, director, Crisil Ratings. Overall, rural demand is trending upward, although it varies by region due to local flooding and changes in crop patterns.""Yes, it served as a catalyst rather than a fundamental driver,"" she said, adding, ""Tractors, excluding those with an engine capacity over 1,800cc, are now subject to a 5% GST rate, down from the previous 12%, and the GST rate on parts has also been reduced from 18% to 5%.As most models fall within this category, affordability has seen a modest improvement, leading to some pre-purchase activity.""However, industry representatives point out that the impact of the GST rate cut is largely a short-term boost rather than a sustained improvement.For the half-year ended September 30, 2025, total domestic tractor volumes stood at 5.61 lakh units, compared with 4.72 lakh units in H1 of FY25, registering a growth of 19%.Top tractor maker Mahindra & Mahindra reported a 50% and 20% increase in its domestic volumes for Sept and the H1 period, respectively. Escorts Kubota saw its Sept and H1 domestic volumes and exports grow 48.5% and 13%, respectively. Sonalika Tractors said it clocked its highest-ever monthly sales (including exports) in September.","Domestic tractor sales stood at 1,46,180 units in September, compared with 1,00,542 units in Sept 2024, marking an increase of 45%.

MUMBAI: Winro Commercial, a BSE-listed non-banking finance company (NBFC) with a market cap of nearly Rs 31 crore, has bid in LG Electronics India IPO for shares worth nearly Rs 749 crore, raising eyebrows among market players. The company is known to be active in the IPO space; it usually bids in the anchor books of offers, a market source said.The city-headquartered NBFC on Friday morning disclosed to BSE that it had applied for nearly 65.6 lakh shares of LG Electronics India at a per-share price of Rs 1,140 under the QIB segment of the offer, amounting to a total application value of close to Rs 749 crore.The shares of the company have not been traded for more than six and a half years.

The last available annual report is of FY15.For FY25, the company had earned a consolidated net profit of Rs 481 crore on a total income of Rs 440 crore.Market players said that such disproportionate bidding when compared to a bidder's financials should always alert investors as the current IPO frenzy could end in heartbreaks.On Thursday, the Rs 11,607-crore IPO for LG Electronics India closed with a demand book worth nearly Rs 4.4 lakh crore (ex-anchor investor part), translating to 54 times oversubscription.

MUMBAI: The Tata Trusts board met on Friday at a time when differences over governance and transparency among its members have surfaced in the public domain.All the trustees except Darius Khambata attended the meeting held at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in south Mumbai. While chairman Noel Tata and trustees Venu Srinivasan, Mehli Mistry and Pramit Jhaveri were physically present at the meeting, other members - Vijay Singh and Jehangir Jehangir - participated virtually.Usually, the board meeting is held at the Trusts' office in World Trade Centre in south Mumbai, but this time, the venue was changed. The board discussed and gave in-principle approvals to philanthropic projects of over Rs 1,100 crore. These included tribal upliftment projects, establishing a Rs 700-crore diabetes research centre near Delhi, and specialty hospitals in Maharashtra. The six-hour meeting went smoothly, said sources privy to the development, adding that there was no discussion on any matter relating to Tata Sons.Friday's meeting comes after some trustees sought the Centre's intervention to broker peace among opposing groups and break a governance impasse.Disagreements reportedly started soon after Noel Tata became the Trusts' chairman in Oct 2024. Matters escalated at the Sept board meeting when majority of trustees opposed Trusts vice-chairman Vijay Singh's reappointment to Tata Sons board.The trustees not on the board of Tata Sons have alleged that the Trusts' nominee directors on Tata Sons have not been providing them complete updates especially on matters falling under Article 121, restricting their ability to make informed decisions. Currently, the two nominee directors on the Tata Sons board are Noel Tata and Venu Srinivasan. Both had opposed Singh's ouster as a Trusts nominee as well as a proposal to appoint Mehli Mistry to the board of Tata Sons at the Sept meeting.According to the minutes of the Sept board meeting, Mehli had requested Singh to be present at the meeting where agenda items included the review of nominee directors of Tata Sons over the age of 75 years. Singh had indicated he did not want to be present when his directorship was coming for review. Khambata, according to the minutes, had underscored that the review had nothing to do with Singh but was related to the ""existential issues confronting the Tata Group"". He noted that ""This was a critical time for the Tata Group given the concerns related to listing and the efforts required to be made in that regard.""","All the trustees except Darius Khambata attended the meeting held at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in south Mumbai.

The rupee strengthened by 7 paise to close at 88.72 against the US dollar on Friday, buoyed by positive domestic market trends and a broad decline in crude oil prices, PTI reported.Forex traders said the central bank’s intervention also provided support, although a firm US dollar capped sharper gains.The rupee opened at 88.80 and traded in a range of 88.50-88.80 before settling at 88.72, compared with Thursday’s close of 88.79. “We expect the rupee to trade with a positive bias on strength in the domestic markets and broad weakness in crude oil prices. The US government shutdown and rising chances of a Federal Reserve rate cut may further bolster the rupee,” said Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst, Currency and Commodities, Mirae Asset ShareKhan.He added that importer demand and a strong US dollar could limit upside, with the USD-INR expected to trade between 88.40 and 88.85.Brent crude was trading lower by 0.61 per cent at $64.85 per barrel in futures trading, while the dollar index fell 0.21 per cent to 99.32.Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said the rupee gained due to foreign inflows into domestic equities and retreat in crude oil prices, noting technical support at 88.50 and resistance at 88.85 for the USD-INR spot pair.Domestic equities mirrored the positive sentiment, with the Sensex rising 328.72 points, or 0.40 per cent, to 82,500.82, and the Nifty climbing 103.55 points, or 0.41 per cent, to 25,285.35.

BluSmart’s social media account appeared to have gone extra candid on X, leaving users both shocked and amused. A post from the verified handle appeared to air out the internal grievances against the company, “Everyone, BluSmart company has been shut since Feb 2025. Founders have done the fraud. Do not expect any refund of your wallet money. Even the employees have also not got their 4 months salary. No point messaging on social media.”The post quickly went viral, with many users unsure whether it was a whistleblower moment or just a furious ex-employee airing dirty laundry. Within hours, the internet was flooded with reactions, memes, and amateur investigations trying to figure out who still had access to the account — and why they decided to go nuclear.The abrupt announcement immediately triggered questions over its authenticity, with users suggesting it may have come from a disgruntled employee. One user, ommented, “Intern still had the creds and took revenge.” Another, user wrote, “Looks like someone from the social media team with the credentials tweeted this out of frustration over not receiving their four months’ salary.” A third user, quipped, “Please reword the bio to: Fraud, zero refund.Always.”The viral post has reignited scrutiny of BluSmart’s mounting financial troubles. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in Ahmedabad recently admitted a petition against the electric cab operator for defaulting on dues worth around Rs 1.28 crore, triggering a corporate insolvency resolution process. NPV Insolvency Professionals Private Ltd was appointed as the Interim Resolution Professional to oversee the process.Once a promising name in India’s EV-based ride-hailing market, BluSmart’s operations have been under pressure due to mounting liabilities and cash flow problems. Its key shareholder, Gensol Engineering, and its subsidiary Gensol EV Lease are also undergoing insolvency proceedings. Reports indicate that promoters Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi are under investigation by SEBI for allegedly diverting company loans for personal use, including purchasing luxury property and inflating stock prices.The NCLT has since imposed a moratorium on all recovery proceedings and asset transfers. Customers, meanwhile, are expressing concern over refunds from BluSmart’s in-app wallet system. Legal experts say refunds may depend on the company’s prepaid payment instrument licence.","BluSmart’s social media account appeared to have gone extra candid on X, leaving users both shocked and amused.

On being asked if the meeting had been cancelled, he said, ""No, I haven't cancelled. But I don't know that we're going to have it. I'll be there regardless... They hit the world with something... it was shocking...

Trump EXPLODES Over Xi’s ‘SINISTER’ Trade Move, ‘Cancels’ Key Meeting Amid China’s Rare Earth Tiff





Wall Street suffered steep losses Friday after US President Donald Trump signaled a sharp escalation in trade tensions with China, threatening to impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports.The S&P 500 fell 2.7% in its worst session since April, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 878 points, or 1.9%, and the Nasdaq composite slid 3.6%.Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Trump posted on his social media platform that he was considering “a massive increase of tariffs” on Chinese imports. He is upset at China’s restrictions on exports of rare earths, materials critical for manufacturing everything from consumer electronics to jet engines.“We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. He also said, “now there seems to be no reason” to meet with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, after earlier agreeing to do so as part of an upcoming trip to South Korea.The sharp rise in tensions led to widespread losses across Wall Street, with roughly six out of every seven S&P 500 stocks falling. Large companies including Nvidia and Apple, as well as smaller firms, faced drops due to uncertainty about tariffs and trade. Levi Strauss dropped 12.6% despite reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly profits and a full-year forecast within Wall Street’s estimates.All told, the S&P 500 fell 182.60 points to 6,552.51, the Dow Jones dropped 878.82 to 45,479.60, and the Nasdaq sank 820.20 to 22,204.43.The oil market also reacted, with US crude falling 4.2% to $58.90 per barrel and Brent crude dropping 3.8% to $62.73 per barrel. Prices eased as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas reduced concerns about potential disruptions to oil supply, while fears of a slowdown in global trade added downward pressure.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury sank to 4.05% from 4.14% late Thursday. Consumer sentiment remains weak, with the University of Michigan reporting that “Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers’ minds.

Decline of the US dollar?

(AI image)

Gold has broken through multiple records

Gold’s staggering rally in numbers

Gold, which was below $2,000 two years ago, has smashed records by climbing above $4,000. The precious metal has risen more than 50% this year amidst concerns regarding trade, the autonomy of the US Federal Reserve and American fiscal health.

According to Bloomberg, the precious metal is heading towards its strongest yearly gains since the 1970s, an era characterised by swift inflation and the abandonment of the gold standard, which resulted in the metal's value multiplying 15-fold!

The 2025 surge in gold prices stands out as it has occurred without a financial crisis. The 52% increase in futures prices this year is set to exceed similar increases seen during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2007-09 economic downturn, second only to the inflationary period of 1979.

Exchange-traded funds have seen substantial investment activity, with gold-backed ETFs experiencing their most significant monthly influx in over three years during September.

In the Indian market, gold prices have crossed the Rs 1.2 lakh mark on the MCX futures. Overall MCX Gold has given a return of 60.41% on YTD basis also supported by weaker Indian currency pairs which had depreciated by 3.71 % against the dollar.

Gold has outperformed stocks this century

Gold is on a record-breaking spree - even by its safe haven standards! Gold prices have been rising to new lifetime highs both in the domestic and international markets - smashing records with a bull run not seen in several years.Gold prices surged beyond $4,000 per ounce in international markets this week, reaching this unprecedented level amid growing worries about the United States economy and the US government shutdown, which propelled the ongoing upward trend.The precious metal's price increase also coincided with apprehensions that the technology sector-driven surge, which pushed several stock markets to all-time peaks, might have become excessive, sparking discussions about potential market overvaluation.Central banks around the world are increasing the percentage of gold reserves in their overall foreign exchange reserves. Why are gold prices rising so rapidly? Are investors worried about the future of the dollar? Experts weigh in:According to Wall Street Journal, investors concerned about the stability of major currencies including the dollar are increasingly shifting their investments towards alternative assets such as gold and bitcoin, creating a notable trend that financial analysts refer to as the debasement trade.Experts in the markets have interpreted this investment pattern as an indication that the substantial rise in government borrowing and persistent elevated inflation levels are creating uncertainty regarding the stability of currencies that form the foundation of international financial markets.As per a Bloomberg analysis, gold prices typically surge during periods of economic and political uncertainty. The precious metal surpassed $1,000 per ounce following the global financial crisis, reached $2,000 during the Covid pandemic, and exceeded $3,000 as global markets reacted to the Trump administration's tariff policies in March.The metal has now exceeded $4,000, coinciding with various factors, including US President Donald Trump's confrontation with the Federal Reserve, specifically his threats towards Chair Jerome Powell and attempts to remove Governor Lisa Cook, presenting an unprecedented challenge to the central bank's independence.Central banks around the world are also buying gold in a big way, adding to the rally. Since the global financial crisis, central banks have transformed from net sellers to net buyers of gold.Purchase rates doubled after the 2022 freezing of Russia's foreign-exchange reserves by the US and allies, following Russia's war with Ukraine. This action prompted many central banks to seek portfolio diversification, whilst inflation concerns and potential changes in US treatment of foreign creditors enhanced gold's attractiveness to monetary authorities.Rising geopolitical conflicts have also driven increased interest in safe-haven investments this year, whilst central banks maintain their substantial gold purchasing activities.The surge in gold prices has intensified as investors look to safeguard against possible market disruptions amid the governmental budget standoff in Washington. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's shift towards monetary easing has benefited gold, an asset that generates no interest.Goldman Sachs has increased its gold price projection for December 2026 to $4,900 per ounce, revised upwards from their previous estimate of $4,300.Gold represents a valuable asset independent of institutional confidence, as communicated by the bank to its customers.While Goldman's analysts and various research institutions anticipate continued price increases driven by central-bank acquisitions, Bank of America's historical analysis reveals that since the 1860s, extended periods of gold price appreciation have invariably been succeeded by significant declines.Ray Dalio, the billionaire investor, expressed on Tuesday that gold serves as a more reliable safe-haven asset compared to the US dollar, drawing parallels between the current rally and the 1970s market conditions. These observations followed Citadel's Ken Griffin's comments linking gold's price surge to concerns about American currency stability.""Gold is a very excellent diversifier of the portfolio,"" Dalio stated whilst speaking with Bloomberg's Lisa Abramowicz at the Greenwich Economic Forum in Connecticut. ""So if you were to look at just from the strategic asset allocation mix perspective, you would probably have as the optimal mix something like 15% of your portfolio in gold.""""Gold breaking $4,000 isn't just about fear — it's about reallocation,"" said Charu Chanana, a strategist at Saxo Capital Markets Pte according to a Bloomberg report. ""With economic data on pause and rate cuts on the horizon, real yields are easing, while AI-heavy equities look stretched. Central banks built the base for this rally, but retail and ETFs are now driving the next leg.""""We expect gold to reach a cyclical peak when there is greatest market concern about the outlook for Fed independence,"" Macquarie Bank Ltd. analysts wrote in a September 30 note. ""In the event, however, that a compromised Fed were to make clear policy errors, gold's performance should of course be even stronger.""Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers tells TOI, “US Treasury yields remain on the back foot across the curve as investors slightly increase bets on faster Fed easing in the months ahead, with 111 basis points (bps) of interest rate cuts priced in by December 2026. The CME Fed Watch Tool indicates markets are pricing a 94.6% chance that the Fed will lower rates by 25 bps at the October 29-30 FOMC meeting. ”“With the US shutdown still yet to be resolved, prices are likely to continue upward trajectory where we expect a level of $ 4,105 – 4,150 per oz likely to be tested in spot markets in the short term perspective of 1 – 2 weeks. This could be followed by consolidative moves towards the start of November month. finally translating to an likely upside peak up to Rs. 1,23,800 – 1,24,500 per 10 gm. on MCX futures contract. Any resolution towards the US Shutdown process over the weekend could again bring back profit booking moves in next week,” he adds.","Gold has smashed records by climbing above $4,000. The precious metal is heading towards its strongest yearly gains since the 1970s. Central banks around the world are increasing the percentage of gold reserves in their overall foreign exchange reserves. Investors concerned about the stability of major currencies including the dollar are increasingly shifting their investments towards alternative assets.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124459347,imgsize-43512,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-price.jpg"

Trump EXPLODES Over Xi’s ‘SINISTER’ Trade Move, ‘Cancels’ Key Meeting Amid China’s Rare Earth Tiff

Also read:





US president Donald Trump on Friday accused China of taking a “sinister and hostile” step after Beijing imposed sweeping new export controls on rare earth elements, warning that he could respond with a “massive increase of tariffs” on Chinese goods entering the United States.In a post on Truth Social, the US President said “some very strange things are happening in China”, accusing Beijing of becoming “very hostile” by sending letters to countries around the world announcing plans to impose export controls on critical materials used in global manufacturing. “Nobody has ever seen anything like this,” Trump wrote, adding that such a move would “clog the markets, and make life difficult for virtually every country in the world, especially for China. ”The 47th POTUS said he had not spoken to Xi Jinping and no longer saw a reason to meet him at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit later this month, saying the Chinese letters were “especially inappropriate.” He concluded: “I never thought it would come to this, but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come. Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A.Trump said the move came as a “real surprise” given what he described as a previously “very good” six-month relationship with Beijing. “I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!” he said. “There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the world ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘magnets’ and other elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a monopoly position a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least. ”Beijing’s ministry of commerce announced the new rules on Thursday, requiring special approval for any exports of rare earth elements or products that contain even trace amounts of them. China, which dominates global rare earth production and processing, said the curbs are meant to “safeguard national security.” The restrictions are likely to impact key industries, from defence to electronics, that depend on the minerals.Trump suggested the timing of the Chinese announcement, coinciding with what he called a day of “peace in the Middle East,” was no coincidence. “I wonder if that timing was coincidental?” he wrote. He added that he would “financially counter their move,” warning that Washington was preparing tough measures. “One of the policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.”",US President Donald Trump accuses China of taking a ‘sinister and hostile’ step after Beijing imposed sweeping new export controls on rare earth elements.

"US markets today: Wall Street slides, S&P falls 2% as Trump threatens higher China tariffs; investors brace for renewed trade tension",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-markets-today-sp-500-and-dow-hold-near-all-time-highs-crude-oil-slips-on-gaza-ceasefire/articleshow/124456814.cms,"



A months-long calm on Wall Street shattered on Friday after President Donald Trump threatened to sharply raise tariffs on China, triggering a broad market sell-off and pushing the S&P 500 toward its steepest loss since April.The S&P 500 slid 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 622 points and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.7%, as investor sentiment soured following Trump’s remarks on his social media platform Truth Social, AP reported. The president said he was considering “a massive increase of tariffs” on Chinese imports, expressing anger at restrictions China has imposed on exports of rare earths — key materials used in manufacturing electronics and jet engines.“We have been contacted by other countries who are extremely angry at this great trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,” Trump wrote, adding there was “no reason” to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his upcoming trip to South Korea.The flare-up in trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies sent shockwaves across Wall Street, with four out of every five stocks in the S&P 500 declining.Shares of major technology companies including Apple and Nvidia tumbled, alongside smaller firms vulnerable to trade uncertainty.Market analysts said the sell-off also reflected growing concerns about overvaluation, following a nearly 35% surge in the S&P 500 since April that had lifted it to record highs. Critics warned that stock prices have risen far faster than corporate profits, echoing concerns reminiscent of the dot-com bubble in 2000.Levi Strauss was among the day’s biggest decliners, dropping 11.4% despite reporting quarterly earnings that beat analyst expectations. Its full-year forecast met Wall Street estimates, but the stock’s earlier 42% surge this year left little room for disappointment.Oil prices also slid sharply after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect in Gaza, easing fears of supply disruptions in the Middle East. Benchmark US crude fell 4.1% to $58.99 per barrel, while Brent crude dropped 3.9% to $62.66.Bond yields retreated as investors sought safety, with the 10-year US Treasury yield falling to 4.07% from 4.14%.A University of Michigan survey showed consumer sentiment remained subdued, with high prices and weakening job prospects continuing to weigh on confidence. “At this time, consumers do not expect meaningful improvement in these factors,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers.The report also indicated inflation expectations eased slightly, with one-year inflation forecasts dipping to 4.6% from 4.7%. Economists said that could help ease pressure on the Federal Reserve, which cut its benchmark rate last month for the first time this year to support slowing growth.Global markets also mirrored the sell-off. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.7%, Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1%, and major European indices ended lower. South Korea’s Kospi, however, gained 1.7% as trading resumed after a holiday.","The S&P 500 slid 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 622 points.

US tax filing: IRS releases income tax brackets and standard deductions for 2026; here's what has changed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tax-filing-irs-releases-income-tax-brackets-and-standard-deductions-for-2026-heres-what-has-changed/articleshow/124455881.cms,"What’s changing in 2026

Married couples filing jointly will be able to claim $32,200, up from $31,500 in 2025



Single taxpayers can claim $16,100, up from $15,750.



Heads of households will have a deduction of $24,150, according to CBS News.

Understanding your tax

$24,800 taxed at 10% = $2,480



$24,800–$100,800 taxed at 12% = $9,120



$100,800–$117,800 taxed at 22% = $3,740







The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced the new federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for 2026, offering some relief to Americans as they prepare for next year’s tax returns.The IRS usually makes these adjustments in October or November to prevent what's known as “bracket creep.” This occurs when inflation pushes taxpayers into higher income brackets, which can result in them paying more in taxes the following April, though the actual purchasing power has not improved.For the 2026 tax year, which will be filed in 2027, the top federal income tax rate of 37% will apply to individuals with taxable income above $640,600 and married couples filing jointly with income over $768,700.The agency has also raised thresholds for long-term capital gains, estate and gift tax exemptions, and eligibility for the earned income tax credit, ET reported citing CNBC.The standard deduction is also increasing:Seniors could benefit from an extra tax break under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Individuals aged 65 and above may claim a temporary deduction of up to $6,000, available until the end of 2028, for those earning $75,000 or less, or couples earning $150,000 or less.The IRS has warned that an agency-wide furlough will start in October due to a lapse in federal funding caused by the government shutdown. Despite this, taxpayers with an extension deadline of October 15 should continue filing as usual.“Taxpayers should continue to file, deposit, and pay federal income taxes as they normally would; the lapse in appropriations does not change Federal Income Tax responsibilities,” an IRS spokesperson told CBS News.In the US, taxation is progressive, meaning that they increase as the income rises. They come in 7 brackets: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%.To see how the changes affect you, consider a married couple earning $150,000. Subtracting the 2026 standard deduction of $32,200 leaves $117,800 in taxable income. They fall into the 22% marginal tax bracket, but their effective tax rate is lower:This totals $15,340 in federal income tax, resulting in an effective rate of 13%.","Married couples filing jointly will be able to claim $32,200, up from $31,500 in 2025.

China on Friday announced that it will start imposing “special port fees” on ships built or operated by the US.According to the transport ministery, the fees will take effect at Chinese ports from October 14 when US ships arriving in China will pay 400 yuan ($56) per net tonne, rising to 640 yuan in April. The fees will also undergo more increases annually.The ministry clarified that the charges apply to each voyage to China, not each individual port, and no ship will be charged more than five times a year.The move follows Washington’s April fees on Chinese-built and operated ships and the charges will take effect the same day as US port fees. US imposed these charges after an investigation into China’s shipbuilding sector, initiated under the previous US administration.A spokesperson for China’s transport ministry described the charges as a “legitimate measure to safeguard the lawful rights and interests of Chinese shipping companies.”They also said, “We urge the US side to immediately correct its wrongful practices and cease its unwarranted suppression of China's shipping industry.”","US ships arriving in China will pay 400 yuan ($56) per net tonne, rising to 640 yuan in April.

Why can China fly over Russia but US can’t?

US’ new proposal

Effects on market

US-China tensions





The Trump administration has made another attempt to ensure fairness for US workers, asking China to bar its airplanes from flying over Russia as it puts American airlines at a disadvantage.The US government on Thursday presented a proposal to stop Chinese airlines from flying over Russia on routes to and from the United States, arguing that this gives them a major competitive edge over American carriers.The US transportation department said that the current arrangement was “unfair and has resulted in substantial adverse competitive effects on US air carriers,” Reuters reported.By flying through Russian airspace, Chinese airlines can cut travel time, save fuel, and lower costs.American carriers lost access to Russian skies in March 2022, when Washington banned Russian flights over US territory after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.Russia responded by blocking US and many other foreign airlines from its airspace.Chinese airlines, however, were not restricted and have been using this advantage to grow their international market share.The new proposal would apply the same overflight restrictions to Chinese carriers operating passenger routes under US-issued foreign air carrier permits.Cargo-only services would not be affected.If approved, the rule could impact US flights operated by Air China (601111.SS), China Eastern (600115.SS), China Southern (600029.SS) and Xiamen Airlines.Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific (0293.HK) flies over Russia on its New York–Hong Kong route, but it was not named in the order, according to Reuters.Shares in China’s three biggest airlines slipped slightly on Friday after the news. Air China fell 1.3%, China Southern dropped 1.8% and China Eastern eased 0.3% by midday. The state-owned carriers have posted five straight years of losses since the pandemic.The move adds to wider US–China economic tensions. Earlier, Beijing tightened export controls on rare earth minerals, key for some US industries. Meanwhile, Boeing is in discussions to sell up to 500 aircraft to China, a potential breakthrough after years of stalled orders.US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet in South Korea later this month to discuss trade and other issues.Chinese airlines have been given two days to respond to the proposal. A final order could take effect as soon as November.In May 2023, the US allowed more flights by Chinese airlines after they agreed to avoid Russian airspace on new routes. Last year, Washington capped Chinese passenger flights at 50 round trips a week, backing away from further increases after lobbying by US airlines and unions. Before the pandemic in early 2020, both sides allowed more than 150 weekly round trips.Some US airlines have told the Trump administration that direct flights from the East Coast to China are not financially viable without access to Russian airspace. Longer routes mean some planes must fly with empty seats and reduced cargo to manage fuel limits.","The US government on Thursday presented a proposal to stop Chinese airlines from flying over Russia on routes to and from the United States.

The United States will purchase 11 icebreaking vessels from Finland in a move aimed at bolstering its Arctic maritime capabilities, President Donald Trump announced on Thursday during a meeting with Finnish President Alexander Stubb at the White House.Under the agreement, four vessels will be built in Finland, while seven will be constructed in the United States, with the Finnish side providing expertise and technical assistance.“What you're doing is you're going to be teaching us about the icebreaker business,” Trump told Stubb in the Oval Office. “We need these ships very badly because we have a lot of territory...

The specifics of the timeline and total cost of the deal are expected to be finalised in upcoming bilateral defence and infrastructure discussions.","The United States will purchase 11 icebreaking vessels from Finland in a move aimed at bolstering its Arctic maritime capabilities.

The US directly purchased Argentine pesos on Thursday and finalised a $20 billion currency swap framework with Argentina’s central bank, said treasury secretary Scott Bessent. The move is intended to provide assistance amid the Latin American country’s economic turmoil.In a social media post on X, Bessent wrote, “US Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets,” adding that the treasury department conducted four days of meetings with Argentinian finance minister Luis Caputo in Washington DC to come up with the deal.Bessent emphasised that the swap is not a bailout. He highlighted Argentina’s strong economic fundamentals, including structural changes already underway that are expected to generate significant dollar-denominated exports and foreign exchange reserves.“Argentina faces a moment of acute illiquidity. The international community – including @IMFNews – is unified behind Argentina and its prudent fiscal strategy, but only the United States can act swiftly.And act we will,” Bessent said.He also noted the close coordination between Argentina and the International Monetary Fund. “Argentina’s policies, when anchored on fiscal discipline, are sound. Its exchange rate band remains fit for purpose,” he added. Looking ahead, Bessent said he looks forward to the meeting between President Trump and President Milei on October 14 and to further discussions with Minister Caputo at the IMF Annual Meetings.Despite this, US farmers and Democratic lawmakers have criticised the deal as a bailout of a country that has benefited from soybean sales to China, to the detriment of US farmers.Argentina is one of the biggest economies in Latin America and the largest borrower from the International Monetary Fund, with total outstanding credit of $41.8 billion as of August 31.The offer of financial help comes as Trump has frequently promoted his “America First” agenda. Critics contend that the planned intervention is a way to reward a personal friend of Trump’s who is facing a critical midterm election next month.Caputo was in Washington last week for talks with Bessent about the swap line. Following the announcement, Milei celebrated it on social media, hailing his economy minister, Luis Caputo, as “far and away, the best Minister of Economy in all of Argentine history…!!!”Argentina’s deregulation minister, Federico Sturzenegger, also congratulated C ap uto and the rest of the economic team, saying: “Let’s keep working so that our children want to stay and live in Argentina,” and adding a pitch to voters to support Milei in the crucial midterm elections later this month, reported AP.",US Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent announced a $20 billion currency swap with Argentina.

US home loans ease: Average 30-year mortgage rate drops to 6.3%; borrowing costs at lowest level in a year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-home-loans-ease-average-30-year-mortgage-rate-drops-to-6-3-borrowing-costs-at-lowest-level-in-a-year/articleshow/124430542.cms,"



The average long-term mortgage rate in the US fell to 6.3% this week, returning to its lowest level in about a year, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said on Thursday. The rate on a 30-year fixed loan edged down from 6.34% last week, while a year ago it averaged 6.32%.Rates on 15-year fixed mortgages, often used for refinancing, also eased, slipping to 5.53% from 5.55% last week. A year ago, the 15-year rate stood at 5.41%, AP reported.Mortgage rates typically follow the 10-year Treasury yield, which guides lenders on home loan pricing. The 10-year yield was at 4.13% at midday Thursday, up from 4.09% last week, after trending higher from 4.02% on September 11.The drop in mortgage rates comes after weeks of easing in the lead-up to the Federal Reserve’s first interest rate cut in a year last month amid concerns over the US job market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signalled caution on further rate cuts, contrasting with some Fed committee members appointed by President Donald Trump who advocate faster reductions.Experts note that even if the Fed lowers short-term rates further, mortgage rates may not continue to fall. After the Fed’s rate cuts last year, mortgage rates initially ticked higher, eventually surpassing 7% in January this year.","The average long-term mortgage rate in the US fell to 6.3% this week, returning to its lowest level in about a year.

Elon Musk pay package: Tesla CEO could earn billions without achieving key targets; here’s what experts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-pay-package-tesla-ceo-could-earn-billions-without-major-breakthroughs-heres-what-experts-say/articleshow/124420417.cms,"Vehicle and product goals may be easier than they appear

Payouts for modest targets could reach billions

Profit goals remain the toughest hurdle





Elon Musk could claim tens of billions of dollars from Tesla’s record-setting executive pay package without meeting most of the “Mars-shot” goals set by the board, according to a Reuters analysis of his performance criteria and expert review.The September-approved package offers Musk up to $878 billion in stock over 10 years if he achieves ambitious targets. Tesla’s board said Musk must “completely transform Tesla and society as we know it” in robotics, autonomous driving, stock value, and profits, adding he would receive “zero” unless these goals are met.Yet, Reuters report found that Musk could collect more than $50 billion by achieving a few of the board’s easier goals, which would not necessarily transform Tesla’s products or operations. Even hitting just two of the simplest targets along with modest stock growth could net $26 billion—more than the combined lifetime pay of the next eight highest-paid CEOs, including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, according to research firm Equilar.Automotive experts told Reuters that Musk’s vehicle sales targets are relatively easy. Selling 1.2 million cars a year over the next decade, assuming Tesla’s market value grows from $1.4 trillion today to $2 trillion by 2035, would earn him $8.2 billion in stock—well under long-term market-average growth and half a million fewer cars than Tesla sold in 2024.Other product-development targets are written in vague terms that could allow large payouts without substantially boosting profits, six robotics and autonomous-driving experts told Reuters.One goal requires 10 million subscriptions to Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” software, which cannot drive fully autonomously and only requires an “advanced driving system.” William Widen, a University of Miami law professor specialising in autonomous driving, called the term “made-up” with no industry-standard definition. Experts said the target could be easily met by reducing the subscription price, currently $8,000 upfront or $99 a month.Another goal requires one million robotaxis operating “without a human driver in the vehicle.” Four autonomous-vehicle experts told Reuters this could be interpreted to allow remote human control or a passenger-seat operator, as Tesla does in its small-scale Austin test.A third target sets one million robots—likely referring to Tesla’s Optimus humanoid project—but the goal does not specify “humanoid” and defines “bot” broadly as “any robot or other physical product with mobility using artificial intelligence,” two robotics experts said. Christian Rokseth, an analyst at Humanoid.guide, called it a “totally vague formulation.”Achieving any two product goals in a decade, alongside a $2.5 trillion valuation, would pay Musk $26.4 billion in stock. Completing three goals and a $3 trillion valuation could deliver $54.6 billion—without necessarily producing driverless Teslas, the company’s signature promise.Gene Munster, managing partner at Tesla investor Deepwater Asset Management, told Reuters that investors would ultimately hold Musk accountable for delivering transformational products. “If people start smelling there’s something goofy here, he’s in trouble,” he said.The Tesla board described Musk as “motivated by more than just conventional forms of compensation” and the only person capable of transforming the company into an AI leader. The board added that during negotiations, Musk raised the possibility of “prioritising other ventures” if they could not agree on compensation.Corporate governance experts said the board is taking a major risk by tying Tesla’s future to a single executive. Wei Jiang, vice dean at Emory University’s business school, said the board has granted Musk a “monopoly” on Tesla’s top job, noting that good governance requires a competitive market for CEOs.The hardest performance targets for Musk involve profit. The board set eight profit goals between $50 billion and $400 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation, compared with Tesla’s $16.6 billion earnings in 2024.Tesla’s EV business, which accounts for almost all revenue, is facing strong competition and aging models, while the Cybertruck has struggled. Under the compensation structure, Musk could still earn massive stock payouts without hitting any profit target. Every goal paired with a market-value increase offers the same 1% stock award, meaning payouts for easy vehicle and subscription targets are equivalent to meeting ambitious profit targets.Tesla’s valuation goals could also be relatively attainable. Shares could reach $2 trillion if they grow 6.4% annually over the next decade—a slower pace than the S&P 500’s 8.5% long-term average and less than half of the Nasdaq’s 13.2%. Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst tracking Tesla, said the valuation could reach $3 trillion or more with market-average performance, but added that much of the value is based on “future products that don’t exist today. ”Kevin Murphy, a University of Southern California finance professor and Tesla expert witness, told Reuters that vehicle sales and $2 trillion valuation targets “aren’t much of a stretch,” but achieving them alone would not satisfy shareholders. “Shareholders have focused on the hardest goals and biggest payouts because they believe Musk—and only Musk—can hit them. Is it worth it? Shareholders seem to think so,” he said.","Tesla’s board said Musk must “completely transform Tesla and society as we know it’ in robotics, autonomous driving, stock value, and profits.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

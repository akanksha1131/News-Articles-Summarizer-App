Stock market recommendations:Nifty in the last three sessions witnessed a pullback of around 500 points after the sharp decline of 16% in the preceding 5 months as value buying emerged around the key support range of 21,700-22,000. This pullback can be attributed to several factors, including the strength in Asian and European markets, bargain buying in oversold stocks and value buying in blue-chip stocks. The index had been extremely oversold, having declined for 10 consecutive sessions, making the pullback overdue from the deeply oversold zone.Nifty holding above the support area of 21,700-22,000 is expected to extend the pullback towards 22,800 in coming weeks. Key resistance on the higher side is placed at 22,800-23,000 being the confluence of 20 days EMA and recent breakdown area.Nifty has strong support at 22,000-21,700 levels being the confluence of theFactors that support the pullback in the Indian markets in the coming week:Bank Nifty has relatively outperformed the Nifty in the recent weeks and has been consolidating in the last 8 weeks in the broad range of 47,800-50,500. We expect the index to extend the consolidation in the coming weeks. Only a breakout or breakdown in any direction will signal the next directional move in the index.A breach below the lower band of the range will lead to extended decline towards 47,000 levels in the coming sessions. While holding above the support area of will lead to pullback towards the 49,000 levels in the coming sessions.The stock has generated a breakout above the falling channel of the last 6 months signaling reversal of the corrective trend and offers fresh entry opportunity. Buying demand has recently emerged after base at the 200 weeks EMA.The weekly 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal with a positive divergence. We expect the stock to head higher towards 1230 levels in the coming month being the 38.2% retracement of the entire decline (1605-996)The stock has generated a breakout above last 5 weeks consolidation range (1027-978) signaling resumption of up move thus offers fresh entry opportunity.The daily RSI is in uptrend and has also generated a trendline breakout.

Infosys work from office rules: Infosys, the second-largest software services firm in India, has issued a directive on Wednesday requiring its technology staff to comply with the work from office for 10 days monthly mandate, aiming to increase on-campus attendance. Infosys has implemented a new attendance system via a mobile application that mandates employees to be physically present at their designated office locations for at least 10 days monthly. The system will not automatically approve work-from-home requests, according to a senior staff member who requested not to be named.A colleague mentioned this requirement is primarily driven by project needs rather than departmental demands.Department heads at the Bengaluru-based organisation sent emails to their team members, instructing them to restrict their work-from-home requests starting March 10, according to sources who spoke to ET.Also Read | How will Elon Musk-led DOGE’s slashing of federal spending impact Indian IT companies?

These measures are designed to ensure compliance with the new hybrid work requirements while maintaining flexibility for employees.""A senior executive explained that this systematic approach aims to foster better team collaboration whilst maintaining workplace flexibility.The email further said: ""As you know, our hybrid work model expects employees to work from the office for at least 10 days a month, or as per business requirements, whichever is higher.""This directive specifically affects staff at job level 5 (JL5) and below, encompassing team leaders, software engineers, senior engineers, system engineers and consultants.

India calling: Why top startups are moving back home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-calling-why-top-startups-are-moving-back-home/articleshow/118772136.cms,"Representative image

Rise Of

Reverse Flipping

Impact On Indian Startup Ecosystem

The Future of Indian Startups

For years, many Indian startups chose to register their companies abroad — often in the US, Singapore, or even the Cayman Islands — to access global investors and funding. But now, a wave of reverse migration is sweeping through India’s startup ecosystem . Companies that once set up their legal headquarters overseas are moving back to India, a trend known as “reverse flipping”.The list includes big names like Razorpay, Udaan, Pine Labs, and Meesho, with some, like Zepto, having already completed the process. The shift isn’t simple — firms have to secure multiple legal and regulatory approvals and make hefty tax payments. Yet, many are taking the leap, driven by the promise of better IPO prospects, streamlined compliance, and India’s booming economy.Notwithstanding the current state of the secondary market, the Indian capital market has matured significantly for IPOs, offering an attractive alternative to global markets. According to Alok Bathija, Partner at Accel, a software company with $50-$60 million in revenue and stable growth can now list in India, whereas a similar listing in the US would require nearly $500 million in revenue. With Indian markets offering higher valuations and greater accessibility, more startups are seeing the advantage of returning home.Beyond IPO aspirations, shifting back also simplifies compliance, especially for startups in highly regulated sectors like fintech. Many of these companies generate the majority of their revenue in India and operate primarily within its financial system, making it logical for them to align with Indian laws. Amit Nawka, Partner at PwC, explains that fintech startups, as they grow larger and play a bigger role in India’s financial landscape, naturally fit better within the local regulatory framework. “As far as fintechs are concerned, as they get larger and contribute to India’s financial system, it is appropriate for them to be headquartered here, and it also gives regulators a sense of comfort,” he said.The trend is also being fuelled by the expansion of domestic funding options. Previously, Indian startups headquartered abroad had easier access to global investors, particularly US-based venture capital firms, which preferred to invest in companies domiciled within their jurisdiction. But that is no longer the case. According to Siddarth Pai, co-chair at the Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association (IVCA), the rise of family offices and domestic venture capital funds has changed the game. “Not just the IPO-bound startups, but a whole host of other startups are looking to flip back to India, especially those in regulated areas. It becomes easier for a company to plan its expansion and get approvals for setting up new businesses if its parent company is regulated by RBI or Sebi,” he said. The abolition of the angel tax has further encouraged many startups to make the shift.Industry estimates suggest that more than 70 startups are currently in the process of reversing their domiciles, and at least 20 of them are major ecosystem players. However, around 500 Indian startups are still headquartered abroad, mostly in the US and Singapore. Among the most prominent companies to move back was PhonePe , which paid a stagger- ing Rs 8,000 crore in taxes to shift its registration from Singapore to India. Sameer Nigam, co-founder & CEO of PhonePe, emphasised that for a highly regulated company like theirs, being based in India was the most logical decision. “India is where we started, India is where we are focused, and India is where we will stay for decades,” he said.The Indian govt has taken steps to reduce bureaucratic hurdles and speed up the process for startups looking to shift back. Previously, an overseas startup merging with its Indian arm required National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) clearance, a time-consuming procedure. Now, only govt and RBI approvals are needed, making the transition faster and more efficient. The rally in Indian tech stocks has also dispelled the longheld myth that startups must list on NASDAQ to achieve significant valuations. “India is one of the most robust IPO markets globally. In the last year alone, India had the highest number of IPOs globally, and second in value to the US,” said Varun Malhotra, Partner at Quona Capital. In 2024, India had 327 companies listing on the market, versus 183 in the US and 125 in Europe and 98 in China.For startups like Razorpay, moving back to India was an obvious choice. The company is paying over $100 million in taxes to make the transition, but CEO and co-founder Harshil Mathur believes it’s worth it. “The process of going public in India is much more streamlined today, making it a natural choice for startups like ours to grow and thrive in one of the world’s most dynamic economies. For Razorpay, reverse flipping aligns us closer to our primary market. India understands what Razorpay does, and it just makes logical sense for us to list on the market where people know us,” Mathur said.With India rapidly emerging as a global startup powerhouse, this trend is only expected to accelerate. Sunil Khaitan, head of the financing group at Goldman Sachs India, predicts the “trend (will) accelerate in 2025, further positioning India as a key hub for entrepreneurial activity and leading to increased capital market access.” As regulatory reforms continue and the domestic investment ecosystem strengthens, the era of Indian startups incorporating overseas may soon be a thing of the past.","Razorpay, Udaan, Pine Labs, and Meesho are among the startups moving back to India.

Wall street in red as US stocks tumble down amid tariff war and economic fears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-in-red-as-us-stocks-tumble-down-amid-tariff-war-and-economic-fears/articleshow/118774310.cms,"Wall Street took another hit on Thursday rattled by a fresh wave of sell offs rattled. The US market, which was already on the edge over US tariffs and economic uncertainty, suffered massive lows as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 427 points (1 per cent) to 42,579.08, while the Nasdaq fell 483.48 points to 18,069.26, 2.6 per cent down at the end of the day.The S&P 500 index slid 1.8 per cent or 104.11 points to 5,738.52, resuming its recent downturn after a brief recovery spell the previous day.Stocks kept falling despite US President Donald Trump's decision to delay the 25 per cent tariff on Mexican, Canadian and Chinese imports for one month. Investors found little relief, though concerns persisted over whether Trump is using tariffs as a negotiation strategy or if an extended trade war is unavoidable.Despite hopes for a softer stance, Trump is still pressing ahead with additional tariffs set to take effect on 2nd April. The constant back-and-forth tariff imposition has also fuelled the market uncertainty as earlier.Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management said, “These exemptions don’t do much to resolve the general air of uncertainty.” He further added that businesses will continue to opt for a cautious stance in the current scenario until the tariff picture is clear.US firms are already struggling with the instability, while consumers brace for rising prices.All eyes are now on the US jobs report, a key indicator of economic health. So far, strong hiring and consumer spending have helped prevent a recession, and economists expected hiring to ramp up in February.However, some major retailers are flashing warning signs. Macy’s reported lower-than-expected revenue for the end of 2024, despite profits beating forecasts. It also issued a weaker profit outlook for 2025, sending its shares down 0.7 per cent.Victoria’s Secret followed a similar path, beating Q4 estimates but forecasting disappointing revenue for the year ahead, which caused its stock to plunge 8.2 per cent.Some of Wall Street's biggest tech firms are also falling.Chipmakers, which soared in recent years due to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, also took a heavy hit. Marvell Technology fell almost 20 per cent despite recording better-than-expected earnings and predicting over 60 per cent revenue growth this quarter. Even Nvidia, the face of the AI revolution, fell 5.7 per cent, while Broadcom slid 6.3 per cent ahead of its earnings release.These firms are also facing increasing competition with Chinese companies ramping up their own AI development.European markets showed mixed results after the European Central Bank cut interest rates as expected. Germany’s DAX rose 1.5 per cent, while shares across Asia also gained, including a 3.3 per cent jump in Hong Kong and a 1.2 per cent rise in Shanghai.In the bond market, the 10-year US Treasury yield edged up slightly to 4.29 per cent from 4.28 per cent on Wednesday.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 427 points (1 per cent) to 42,579.08.

NEW DELHI: Automobile retail sales across categories, including passenger vehicles and two-wheelers, witnessed a drop of 7% in Feb, amid declining demand, dealers' body FADA said on Thursday. Overall, retail sales in the domestic market stood at 18.9 lakh units last month compared to 20.5 lakh units in the year-ago period.""Feb witnessed a broad-based downturn across all categories,"" FADA president C S Vigneshwar said. During the month, dealers began expressing concerns about inventory being pushed to them without their consent. ""While such initiatives may serve broader business objectives, it is critical to align wholesale allocations with genuine demand to protect dealer viability and ensure healthy inventory management,"" Vigneshwar said.Passenger vehicle retail sales declined 10% year-on-year to 3 lakh units in Feb. ""Dealers noted weak market sentiment, which specially continues in the entry-level category, delayed conversions, challenging targets and stressed that OEMs should avoid overburdening dealers with excessive inventory - a practice that risks unmanageable stock levels given the cyclical nature of the industry,"" Vigneshwar said. Inventory levels in this segment remained in the range of 50-52 days, he said.Two-wheeler sales witnessed a drop of 6% year-on-year in Feb at 13.5 lakh units as compared to 14.4 lakh units sold in Feb last year. Dealers attributed this to inventory imbalances, aggressive pricing adjustments, weak consumer sentiment, lower enquiry volumes and limited finance availability, Vigneshwar noted.","Automobile retail sales across categories, including passenger vehicles and two- wheelers, witnessed a drop of 7% in Feb.

However, the recovery could face disruptions as (US President Donald Trump)'s tariff statements will continue to make investors nervous and trigger selling going ahead,"" Tapse said.The day's upside came despite foreign fund selling while domestic funds were net buyers.

Kiranas move CCI against quick commerce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/kiranas-move-cci-against-quick-commerce/articleshow/118770749.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Kirana stores and FMCG distributors have approached the fair trade regulator seeking an investigation into the anti-competitive practices of quick-commerce platforms like Swiggy Instamart, Zepto & Blinkit.In a petition submitted to the Competition Commission of India on Feb 28, industry body All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF), which represents small retail businesses , alleged that these platforms are resorting to deep discounting and predatory pricing , pushing small retailers out of business. Their conduct, the industry body, said ""appears to eliminate"" competitors from the market. TOI has reviewed parts of the petition. AICPDF confirmed submission of the petition but declined to share details. Zepto and Swiggy Instamart declined to comment on the matter while Zomato did not respond.The industry body alleged that the platforms have deep pockets and are ""indulging in deliberate losses by way of predatory pricing"" to expand in the market. It said that small retailers and traditional distributors are not able to match the discounts offered by the platforms, thereby taking a business hit and slipping into losses.In certain cases to lure new customers, quick-commerce platforms dole out introductory offers in addition to the discounts, which often are in the nature of predatory pricing, AICPDF alleged.The federation has been taking on quick commerce platforms , having sent a letter to the CCI in Oct through the ministry of commerce. This time, however, they have directly filed a petition with the CCI.Quick commerce, or 10-minute delivery platforms, which initially started out selling groceries have rapidly expanded especially in the metros and have moved beyond kitchen staples to sell a range of non-grocery items including small appliances, mobile phones, electronics,jewellery and apparel. Brands, which have found a new avenue of distribution with quick commerce, are more than willing to test the rapid delivery model and continue to partner with these platforms as they are being able to reach more customers.A survey by market research firm Datum Intelligence late last year covering 3,000 respondents across 10 cities had showed that about 82% of buyers have moved at least 25% of kirana purchases to quick commerce. Investor appetite for quick commerce has surged amid wide consumer adoption with Zepto bagging $1.2 billion in funding last year in an otherwise tepid market. The company is planning to file for public listing this year. AICPDF said that quick commerce is ""wiping out millions of retail shops and distributors from the market"".Offline retailers across segments who have already been hit by the advent of online commerce is up against rapid delivery platforms. Already, the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) is pursuing a separate legal case against 10-minute food delivery services (offering private labelled food) by Zomato and Swiggy.","Kirana stores and FMCG distributors have approached the fair trade regulator seeking an investigation into the anti-competitive practices of quick-commerce platforms like Swiggy Instamart, Zepto & Blinkit.

""There is a clear expectation that IPO sizes and valuations will be reassessed,"" said Agarwal.Many startups that are preparing to file their draft IPO papers are opting for the confidential filing route as they navigate an unpredictable market. A confidential filing allows a company the flexibility to adjust the issue size and time of listing while keeping its financial details private.

The Indian stock market closed higher on Thursday, driven by strong domestic investor activity and positive global cues. Financial stocks gained after the RBI's $21 billion liquidity infusion, while energy stocks benefited from lower crude prices. The BSE Sensex rose by 609.86 points (0.83%) to 74,340.09, and the Nifty 50 added 207.40 points (0.93%) to close at 22,544.70.US stocks fell on Thursday as investors grew concerned about the potential impact of tariffs on inflation and economic growth. Wall street’s main indices struggled after President Donald Trump announced a one-month suspension of most tariffs on Mexican goods, with Canada potentially receiving a similar reprieve. European equities saw gains, buoyed by optimism surrounding a rate cut and increased government spending in the eurozone, as AP reported.The following factors will decide the direction of Indian stock market on Friday:The Reserve Bank of India ’s liquidity support helped uplift market sentiment, particularly in the banking sector. Analysts noted that the RBI’s move was timely, offering much-needed relief to businesses and consumers alike.Energy stocks surged as crude prices dipped, while strong liquidity supported the banking and consumption sectors, contributing to the market’s rally.US President Donald Trump's temporary tariff reprieve on auto imports from Mexico and Canada also improved global market sentiment , further supporting the Indian rally. This provided a temporary boost amid worries over potential trade wars.While the Indian market saw gains, Wall Street faced setbacks. Chip stocks, including Marvell, saw steep declines, dragging the broader technology sector lower.

Competition Commission Of India: FMCG distributors’ body seeks CCI investigation against quick commerce platforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fmcg-distributors-body-seeks-cci-investigation-against-quick-commerce-platforms/articleshow/118766427.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: The All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation ( AICPDF ) which represents scores of small retail businesses has petitioned India’s fair trade regulator, seeking an investigation into the anti-competitive practices of quick commerce platforms Swiggy Instamart, Zepto and Zomato’s Blinkit.In its petition to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) submitted on February 28, AICPDF alleged that the platforms are resorting to deep discounting and predatory pricing , pushing small retailers out of business. Their conduct, the industry body, said “appears to eliminate” competitors from the market. TOI has reviewed parts of the petition.AICPDF confirmed submission of the petition but declined to share details. Zepto and Swiggy Instamart did not comment while Zomato did not respond.The industry body alleged that the platforms have deep pockets and are “indulging in deliberate losses by way of predatory pricing” to expand in the market. They alleged that the small retailers and traditional distributors are not able to match the discounts offered by the platforms, thereby taking a business hit and sinking in losses.In certain cases, to lure new customers, AICPDF alleged that the quick commerce platforms dole out introductory offers in addition to the discounts, which often are in the nature of predatory pricing.AICPDF has been fighting against the quick commerce platforms, having sent a letter to the CCI in October through the ministry of commerce. This time, however, they have directly filed a petition with the CCI. Quick commerce or 10-minute delivery platforms which initially started out selling groceries have rapidly expanded especially in the metros where people are often pressed for time and have moved beyond kitchen staples to sell a range of non-grocery items including small appliances, mobile phones, electronics, jewellery and apparel. For brands which have found a new avenue of distribution with quick commerce, they are more than willing to test the rapid delivery model and continue partnership with the platforms as long as they are being able to reach more customers.A survey by market research firm Datum Intelligence late last year covering 3,000 respondents across 10 cities had shown that about 82 per cent of buyers have moved at least 25 per cent of kirana purchases to quick commerce. Investor appetite for quick commerce has surged amid wide consumer adoption with Zepto bagging $1.2 billion in funding last year in an otherwise tepid market. The company is planning to file for public listing this year. AICPDF said that quick commerce is “wiping out millions of retail shops and distributors from the market.”Offline retailers across segments who have already been hit by the advent of online commerce are up against rapid delivery platforms. Already, the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) is pursuing a separate legal case against 10-minute food delivery service offering private labelled food by Zomato and Swiggy.","The All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation ( AICPDF) has petitioned India’s fair trade regulator.

Dollar rally may lose steam as tariffs hurt consumption: S&P,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dollar-rally-may-lose-steam-as-tariffs-hurt-consumption-sp/articleshow/118771020.cms,"Photo/Agencies

MUMBAI: The US dollar may have run out of steam, with weaker economic data resulting in a decline in the dollar index. More weakness may be forthcoming as the announced tariffs will push up prices, reduce spending, and hit growth in the US.""The reversal of the dollar index in the last two-three weeks has been in parallel with the weakened data that has been coming up. When weaker data comes up, the view of what the Fed might do changes towards a more easing bias which in turn leads to less of a pressure on foreign exchange,"" said Satyam Panday, chief economist US & Canada at S&P. He was speaking at Crisil's India outlook event.According to Panday, the US outperformance narrative is probably not going to hold this year, going by the impact of tariffs. ""Without getting into the issue of reciprocal tariffs, the tariffs that have already been implemented - Canada, Mexico and the Chinese tariffs, back of the envelope calculation indicate a 60-70-basis-point price rise impact on the basket. If you look at the marginal propensity to consume you would probably see a 20-30 basis points impact on consumer spending .""According to D K Joshi, chief economist at Crisil, every time the rupee has fallen sharply from its trend rate of depreciation, it has been followed by an appreciation or a long period of stability.""Our forecast of the rupee-dollar exchange rate for March 2025 was at 87 and for March 2026, it was mild depreciation leading up to 88. I between I think there will be volatility but beyond that, this is our projection,"" said Joshi. ""We are going through the volatile phase right now, where you'll see ups and downs in currency. But if it depreciates too much it will also appreciate.""According to Joshi, the outflow of capital now has nothing to do with the interest rate differential but with uncertainty, because of which money was going back to its home market.","The reversal of the dollar index in the last two-three weeks has been in parallel with the weakened data that has been coming up.

"Trump wants India to lower tariffs on autos, but do Harley and Tesla really need them?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-wants-india-to-lower-tariffs-on-autos-but-do-harley-and-tesla-really-need-them/articleshow/118767003.cms,"US President Donald Trump (File Photo-AP)

NEW DELHI: Ironic as it may sound, but while US President Donald Trump pushes for lower import duty on Tesla cars and the iconic Harley-Davidson motorcycles when they come in to India, but neither of the two companies currently source them from America and rather prefer to get them from factories in other countries.While Harley is importing its bikes from its mega manufacturing set-up in Thailand, Tesla – which is close to launching its cars in India – will also not be shipping the electrics from the US, but rather from its factory in Germany (India has requested the company not to import from China).This, industry officials say, clearly brings out the fact that while there is noise and complaints from the new US administration regarding high duties on autos in India, American companies do not see the need to import fully-built products, or even semi- or completely-knocked down kits, from the US.Companies find it better and beneficial to use other manufacturing countries due to locational advantages (that saves freight as well as time when importing to India) or because of economies of scale.For example, look at the business case of Harley-Davidson motorcycles even after the govt decided to cut duty on imported bikes in the just-announced Union Budget. The Budget had slashed the customs duty on fully-built bikes bigger than 1600cc from 50% to 30%, while for SKD (semi-knocked down) kits, it came down from 25% to 20% and for CKD (completely-knocked down) from 15% to 10%. And for bikes with engines smaller than 1600cc, the customs duty was reduced from 50% to 40% for fully-built ones, while on SKDs from 25% to 20%, and on CKDs from 15% to 10%.Despite this, Harley – which makes only the 440cc model (called X440) in India in partnership with Hero Moto -- prefers to get the other models them from Thailand, instead of using its US factories. “There is a mega set-up in Thailand that the company uses to get its bikes to India. Beyond the 440cc that it makes here, all the other bikes – including bigger ones like Pan America, Nightster, Street Glide and Fat Bob -- are being imported from Thailand,” an analyst specializing in foreign trade told TOI.Interestingly, Harley imports its bikes to India at zero duty due to trade agreements between the two countries. “So even if India reduces the duty on imported bikes from the US to zero, Harley will still find it beneficial to get them from Thailand. This is because Thailand is closer to India and so the freight cost will be lower and products can reach faster,” another analyst said.","US President Donald Trump pushes for lower import duty on Tesla cars and the iconic Harley-Davidson motorcycles.

"European central bank cuts interest rates amid looming trade war, growth concern",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/european-central-bank-cuts-interest-rates-amid-looming-trade-war-growth-concern/articleshow/118765117.cms,"European Central Bank (Photo-AP)

The European central bank (ECB) reduced interest rates by 25 basis point on Thursday, aiming to stimulate economic activity as the eurozone grapples with sluggish growth.This move, which lowers borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, comes amid mounting concerns about the impact of potential trade conflicts with the US and rising defence spending.The ECB’s decision to cut its benchmark deposit rate to 2.5% is aimed at supporting the economy by making it cheaper to borrow for investment and consumption. The bank previously raised rates to a record 4% in response to inflation peaking at 10.6% in October 2022, but has been easing rates since June as inflation has since moderated to 2.4%, according to AP report.Despite the decline in inflation, growth remains a pressing concern for the 20 nations using the euro. The eurozone’s economy showed zero growth in the final quarter of 2024, and the outlook for 2025 is uncertain due to shifting dynamics in global trade and the possibility of heightened defence spending.ECB President Christine Lagarde , speaking after the meeting, emphasized that the rate cut would make borrowing conditions “meaningfully less restrictive” for the economy.She cautioned that the central bank was not committing to a specific rate trajectory going forward, acknowledging the complexities presented by global trade tensions and increased government spending.As economic uncertainty continues, Lagarde noted that increased defence and infrastructure spending could spur growth, but growing global trade tensions—particularly with the US—pose a major challenge to inflation expectations in the eurozone.Economists, including Carsten Brzeski from ING Bank, pointed out that with increasing uncertainty and the possibility of large fiscal stimulus, the ECB’s future rate path is unclear. ""A pause at the next meeting to reassess the economic landscape seems likely,"" said Brzeski.The new fiscal realities in Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy, have added another layer of complexity. A new government coalition has agreed to loosen budget restrictions to allow for significantly more borrowing, potentially injecting up to a trillion euros into defence and other sectors over the next decade. This shift in fiscal policy could stimulate growth, but may also lead to increased inflationary pressures.Meanwhile, concerns are rising about US President Trump's potential new tariffs on European goods, which could further hinder growth in the export-driven eurozone economy . The looming trade war adds another layer of uncertainty for businesses already wary of inflation and political shifts.Despite these challenges, some analysts, like Julien Lafargue of Barclays Private Bank, expect the ECB to remain flexible, making future decisions based on incoming economic data. The central bank faces a delicate balancing act: boosting growth while managing inflationary risks, with external pressures such as US tariffs potentially complicating this task.","ECB reduced interest rates by 25 basis point on Thursday.

Trump tariffs: Is China really ready for a trade war with US?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-tariffs-is-china-really-ready-for-a-trade-war-with-us/articleshow/118763757.cms,"Fight

Driving the news

""If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.""

Why it matters

It isn’t just trade. The competing agendas of the leaders of the world’s two largest economies are poised to lead to precisely what China is trying to avoid: a superpower clash not seen since the Cold War, an all-encompassing rivalry over economic, technological and overall geopolitical supremacy. An article in the WSJ

China’s countermeasures

Is China really ready for a trade war against US?

What they’re saying

Trump’s trade advisers: “The US can no longer afford to let China dictate global trade rules. We are reclaiming our economic independence.”

Michael Pillsbury, China expert: “They are kind of desperate. Their economy is in trouble. Now that Trump put the tariffs on, they know this campaign [to avoid them] has failed.”

Chinese officials: “Xi believes that must be avoided,” said a person who consults Beijing, referring to the risk of Soviet-style isolation.

US defense secretary Pete Hegseth : “Those who long for peace must prepare for war. We are strengthening our military to deter China’s aggression.”

Trump’s strategy

Even though Trump may be the one who currently looks isolated on the world stage—picking trade fights with erstwhile allies like Mexico and Canada, alarming Europe over his handling of the war in Ukraine and vowing to annex Greenland and the Panama Canal—the truth is that China doesn’t hold a strong hand. An article in the WSJ

US leverage play

Trump is not stopping at tariffs. His administration is weighing additional measures to tighten restrictions on Chinese investment in the US, limit US companies’ business operations in China, and impose stricter export controls on high-tech goods.

Trump’s team also sees an opportunity to reshape global trade by striking deals with other nations before negotiating with China. The US has been in talks with Mexico, Vietnam, and India to strengthen trade relations and prevent China from using third countries as a backdoor into the US market.

The stakes extend beyond trade. Washington’s push to decouple key industries from China, restrict technology transfers, and rally partners against Beijing’s economic practices suggests a long-term strategy of containment. If successful, these moves could erode China’s ability to sustain high-growth levels, advance its technological ambitions, and project power internationally.

Between the lines

Trump’s trade war is as much about politics as it is about economics. He is betting that his tough stance on China will rally his base, reinforcing his image as a fighter against unfair trade practices.

For China, the challenge is existential. Xi Jinping is determined to avoid the fate of the Soviet Union, which collapsed under economic pressure from the US and its allies. That means China is likely to double down on efforts to insulate itself from US influence—whether through technological self-sufficiency, expanded trade partnerships, or military posturing.

The bottom line: The US-China trade war is entering a new, more intense phase. Trump believes he has the upper hand and is willing to let China “stew” in economic distress until it concedes to US demands, the WSJ report said.","The US-China trade war is entering a new, more intense phase.

In an escalation of the trade-war between US and China, Beijing announced it will impose new tariffs on a range of agricultural imports from the United States, effective next week. This came hours after US President Donald Trump announced increased tariffs against China.The tariffs, as outlined by China's finance ministry, will see an additional 15% tax on imports such as chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton. A 10% tariff will also be levied on a range of other products, including sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy.Also read: US markets tumble as Trump confirms tariffs on Canada, Mexico “China has decided to include 15 US entities that endanger China’s national security and interests in the export control list, prohibiting the export of dual-use items to them,” China's commerce ministry said.The US has been increasing tariffs on several countries, including China, in an ongoing trade dispute. On Monday, President Donald Trump signed an order to increase the existing 10% tariff on Chinese imports to 20%.

‘An act of war’: Warren Buffett on Trump tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/an-act-of-war-warren-buffett-on-trump-tariffs/articleshow/118695693.cms,"Market reaction and economic concerns

Trump’s justification

Buffett’s market moves and long-term outlook

President Donald Trump ’s latest round of tariffs on major US trading partners has sparked concerns about inflation and economic disruption , with legendary investor Warren Buffett weighing in on the potential fallout.In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Buffett called tariffs “an act of war, to some degree,” drawing from decades of experience in the global economy. The billionaire investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway warned that tariffs function as a tax on goods, ultimately leading to higher prices for consumers.“The Tooth Fairy doesn’t pay ‘em!” Buffett quipped during the interview, emphasizing that the financial burden of tariffs will fall on consumers.Buffett’s remarks come as Trump moves forward with imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, effective Tuesday. The administration has also announced an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20%, a move that is likely to escalate tensions with Beijing. In response, China has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs, raising concerns of a renewed trade war .Economists widely agree that tariffs disrupt international trade and lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers. The Trump administration has presented tariffs as a tool to pressure foreign governments and boost domestic manufacturing, but critics warn that such policies could backfire, especially given the deeply integrated supply chains across North America.Trump’s tariff announcement sent financial markets into turmoil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 649 points (1.48%), while the S&P 500 dropped 1.76% and the Nasdaq fell 2.64%. Automaker stocks took a significant hit, with General Motors declining 4% and Ford down 1.7% due to their manufacturing dependencies in Mexico.The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar also declined in response to the news, while officials in both countries signaled that they were preparing countermeasures. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly criticized Trump’s move, calling it “unpredictable and chaotic.”Trump defended the tariffs at a White House event, arguing that they would encourage companies to move production to the U.S. “They’re going to have to have a tariff. So what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs,” he said.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick dismissed Buffett’s concerns, calling them “silly” in an interview on CNN’s The Situation Room. Lutnick went further, suggesting that tariffs could replace the need for the Internal Revenue Service, falsely claiming that the IRS was created when the US entered World War I. In reality, the IRS was established in 1862 during the Civil War, and the modern federal income tax was introduced in 1913.Despite the administration’s claims, experts argue that shifting government revenue away from income taxes to tariffs would be impractical, given the complexity and scale of the modern US economy.Buffett has historically been critical of tariffs, calling Trump’s past trade policies “a very bad idea.” His recent actions in the financial markets suggest caution about the economic outlook. Over the past year, Berkshire Hathaway has significantly increased its cash reserves, reaching a record $334.2 billion in the fourth quarter while selling off shares of major companies like Apple and Bank of America.Although Buffett refrained from directly commenting on the economy in his CBS interview, he described it as “the most interesting subject in the world.”Berkshire Hathaway’s stock has reached record highs, with both Class A and Class B shares surging. However, Buffett’s conservative investment approach has raised speculation that he is preparing for economic uncertainty.(With inputs from agencies)","Warren Buffett calls tariffs “an act of war, to some degree,” drawing from decades of experience in the global economy.

What’s next

US stocks fell sharply on Monday, wiping out much of their gains since President Donald Trump ’s election, after he announced that tariffs on Canada and Mexico would take effect within hours.The S&P 500 dropped 1.8% following Trump's statement that there was ""no room left"" for negotiations to lower the tariffs, which will begin Tuesday. The move dashed Wall Street 's hopes for a softer trade policy.Monday’s losses cut the S&P 500’s post-Election Day gains to just over 1%, down from a peak of more than 6%. The market had rallied on hopes that Trump’s policies would strengthen the economy, but recent trade tensions and economic data have raised fears of a slowdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 649 points, or 1.5%, while the Nasdaq composite slumped 2.6%.The market decline came amid broader concerns about US economic growth. A report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday showed that manufacturing activity remained in expansion but at a slower pace than economists expected. More concerningly, manufacturers saw a contraction in new orders, while prices rose amid discussions over who will bear the cost of Trump’s tariffs.Timothy Fiore, chair of ISM’s manufacturing survey committee, noted, “Demand eased, production stabilized, and destaffing continued as panelists’ companies experience the first operational shock of the new administration’s tariff policy.”Wall Street had anticipated that Trump might use the tariffs as leverage for negotiations rather than enforcing them. However, the decision to proceed unsettled investors already wary of economic uncertainties.“Markets were looking for another 11th-hour deal to further delay tariffs, but aren’t going to get one this time,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. “The next phase is to endure them. Markets have to price that reality, and those numbers are painted red.”James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management, echoed the concerns: “It’s just more of a continuation of a string of bad economic news that tends to put a little bit of a dampener on the optimism we saw from fourth-quarter earnings.”Certain sectors and stocks were hit particularly hard. Nvidia fell 8.8%, and Tesla slipped 2.8%. Retail giant Kroger dropped 3% after its Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an internal investigation into his personal conduct.Even stocks connected to cryptocurrency took a hit. MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy, slid 1.8%, while Coinbase dropped 4.6% despite Trump’s weekend announcement that his administration was moving forward with a crypto strategic reserve.The effects of Trump’s trade policies are being felt worldwide. In China, manufacturers reported an increase in orders in February as buyers rushed to secure goods ahead of higher US tariffs. Trump’s 10% tariff on Chinese imports is set to rise to 20% on Tuesday, and the administration has also ended the “de minimis” loophole that exempted imports worth less than $800 from tariffs.European markets, in contrast, performed better. Germany’s DAX surged 2.6%, and France’s CAC 40 rose 1.1% following a report that showed inflation was easing in February. This bolstered expectations that the European Central Bank may cut interest rates later this week. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, bubble tea chain Mixue Bingcheng soared 43% in its market debut, boosting the Hang Seng index by 0.3%.Investors will be closely watching upcoming economic reports and Federal Reserve signals. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.16% from 4.24% before the manufacturing report’s release, reflecting concerns about a slowing economy. Typically, falling Treasury yields can boost stocks, but this time the decline is driven by fears of a broader economic downturn.With inflation worries still present, the Federal Reserve may have limited room to cut interest rates to stimulate growth. Market expectations currently point to at least two 25-basis-point rate cuts by the end of the year, but economic conditions could force a reassessment of that outlook.(With inputs from agencies)","The S&P 500 dropped 1.8% following Trump's statement that there was ""no room left"" for negotiations to lower the tariffs, which will begin Tuesday.

The US treasury department announced Sunday that it will no longer enforce the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) and its associated Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirements.The decision effectively suspends penalties for US citizens and domestic companies, shifting enforcement efforts toward foreign businesses.The move was welcomed by US President Donald Trump. He celebrated the decision on Truth Social, calling the BOI rule ""outrageous and invasive.""He wrote, ""Exciting news! The treasury department has announced that they are suspending all enforcement of the outrageous and invasive Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirement for US citizens. This Biden rule has been an absolute disaster for small businesses nationwide. Furthermore, treasury is now finalising an emergency regulation to formally suspend this rule for American businesses. The economic menace of BOI reporting will soon be no more.""The BOI rule, introduced under the CTA, required businesses to disclose details about their owners to the treasury’s financial crimes enforcement network (FinCEN) to curb money laundering and financial crimes.However, according to Irish Star, the enforcement of these requirements had already faced multiple delays due to legal challenges.As per Fox Business, treasury secretary Scott Bessent supported Trump’s stance, calling the decision ""a victory for common sense.""He added, ""Today’s action is part of President Trump’s bold agenda to unleash American prosperity by reining in burdensome regulations, in particular for small businesses that are the backbone of the American economy.""The treasury department also confirmed on X that “penalties or fines associated with BOI will not be enforced,” and clarified that the agency will issue a new proposed rule to limit the reporting requirement to foreign companies only.The CTA, which was signed into law in January 2021, was initially set to take effect in January 2024 but repeated federal court rulings delayed its implementation. The law aimed to increase financial transparency by making it harder for criminals to use shell companies for illicit activities such as money laundering and drug trafficking.Trump’s latest policy shift aligns with his broader economic agenda, which includes regulatory rollbacks and spending cuts ranging from $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion, according to Fox Business.","The US treasury department announced Sunday that it will no longer enforce the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) and its associated Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirements.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

Gold and silver price prediction: MCX Gold and MCX Silver have been volatile in the last few days with geopolitical events and Donald Trump’s tariff related developments weighing on investor sentiment. While gold is traditionally a safe haven asset, it has fallen from its peak in the last few sessions. What is the outlook for gold and silver today and for the next few days? What are the target levels investors should look at?MCX Gold has shown a bullish breakout from the lower end of its support zone, indicating a shift in sentiment and the potential for upward momentum. This breakout suggests that the recent downside pressure has likely been absorbed, and the bulls are regaining control. The key resistance is placed at the 95,700 level, and a decisive move above this mark will likely trigger further upside, pushing prices toward the 98,000 level in the near term.On the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reversed direction from the neutral 50 level and is now trending upward toward the overbought zone.This shift in RSI reflects strengthening momentum and supports the bullish outlook for prices.From a technical standpoint, the trend appears constructive, and as long as prices sustain above the support zone of 94,100, the bias remains positive. The formation of higher lows, along with improving momentum indicators, reinforces the possibility of continued gains.In conclusion, MCX Gold is well-positioned for further upside. With support at 94,100 and resistance at 95,700 expected to be breached, the next potential target lies at 98,000. Traders may consider a bullish stance as long as the price holds above key support levels.The daily chart analysis indicates that MCX Silver prices have successfully broken above the consolidation range of 97,500–94,000, signalling a bullish breakout and opening positive potential. With this breakout, there is a possibility for silver prices to extend their upward movement and test the previous swing high at the 1,02,000 level.The Relative Strength Index (RSI), which was previously hovering around the neutral zone (50), has begun to rise, suggesting increasing bullish momentum. The RSI is on its way toward the overbought zone (70), indicating that there is sufficient room for further price appreciation in the near term.Based on Fibonacci analysis, the 61.8% projection from the range of 86,260 to 98,800, coupled with the support zone at 93,700, suggests a potential target for silver prices around the 101,800 level.Given the current market conditions, we are optimistic about Silver’s short-term prospects. Prices are expected to move towards 101,800 with stop loss at the 95,600 level. At the current market price (CMP) of 97,750, the outlook remains positive, and a rally could materialize as the price continues its upward momentum post-consolidation.",Gold and silver have been volatile in the last few days with geopolitical events and Donald Trump’s tariff related developments weighing on investor sentiment.

According to Bajaj Broking Research, NMDC and Polyplex Corp are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for May 23, 2025:

Index View: NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in the broad range of 56,000-53,500 in the last 5 weeks.

A key technical observation on the daily chart is that the index has been trading within a downward-sloping channel for the past 21 sessions. In the last 21 sessions it has retraced just 38.2% of the prior 9-session rally (49,157–56,098), indicating a shallow pullback that suggests underlying strength and potential higher bottom formation

We expect the index to extend the last 5 weeks’ consolidation in the range of 53,500-56,000.

Within the consolidation we believe dips should be used as a buying opportunity. Key support placed at 53,000-53,500 being the confluence of the lower band of the last 5 weeks range, key retracement and 50 days EMA.

Stock market recommendations:Indian equity markets traded with downward bias during the current week weighed down by weak global cues and profit-taking in key sectors. Investor sentiment turned cautious following Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. government’s credit outlook, which led to a spike in U.S. Treasury yields and triggered a broad-based sell-off across global equity markets. The risk-off sentiment reverberated through Asian and European bourses, with Indian benchmarks mirroring the global weakness.The India VIX rose more than 5% over the week, signaling heightened volatility and risk aversion among market participants.On the technical front, the Nifty registered a high of 25,116 last week. However, profit-booking at elevated levels over the past 4-5 sessions led to a retracement, with the index currently hovering near the 24,600 marks.In the near term, we expect the index to enter a consolidation phase within the 24,350–25,000 range, thereby alleviating the overbought conditions indicated by the daily stochastic oscillator following the recent sharp uptrend.Crucial support is seen at the 24,350–24,400 zone, which coincides with the prior week’s low, the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the preceding rally from 23,935 to 25,116. On the upside, resistance is seen around 25,000–25,200 levels, aligning with the 78.6% retracement of the entire decline (26,277-21,744).The stock is at the cusp of generating a breakout above last 2 months consolidation range (71-60) signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.It is currently seen sustaining above the short- and medium-term moving averages. With the 20-, 50- and 200-days EMA all placed around 265-275 highlighting strong support at lower levels.The 14 periods RSI in the daily chart is seen sustaining above its nine periods average thus validates positive bias in the stock. We expect the stock to head higher towards 78 levels in the medium term being the 161.8% external retracement of the previous decline (71-60).The stock has recently generated a breakout above a bullish Cup & Handle formation with strong volume signaling continuation of the up move thus offering fresh entry opportunity.It is currently seen forming higher high and higher low in the daily and weekly chart thus supporting the positive bias in the stock.The daily MACD has recently generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validates positive bias in the stock. We expect the stock to head higher towards 1478 being the confluence of all time high and the measuring implication of the bullish cup & handle breakout.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, NMDC and Polyplex Corp are the top stock picks for today.

Coconut oil on the boil: Price hikes pinch users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/coconut-oil-on-the-boil-price-hikes-pinch-users/articleshow/121350178.cms,"MUMBAI: The humble coconut oil-a must-have product in almost every Indian household-may be the reason your grocery bills pinched you a bit more. Companies like Marico and Dabur collectively took close to 40% price hikes in coconut oil over the past 12 months due to high inflation in the category.Prices of commodities have more or less 'peaked', and any major price increases are unlikely to be passed on to consumers unless there's a 'black swan event', said Saugata Gupta, MD & CEO at Marico, who is betting on better volume growth for the FMCG sector this financial year. For Marico, which makes Parachute coconut oil, copra (from which coconut oil is derived) makes up a large share of its commodity basket. Copra prices soared by 40%-50% over the past year, pushing Marico to take nearly 30% price increases over the past 12 months, Gupta told TOI. Marico leads the coconut oil market with more than a 50% share, according to market estimates. Firms with a bigger play, like Marico, use copra to derive coconut oil, while some buy the oil directly from the market.Dabur took around a 10% price hike in the category in the past three to six months, stockist sources said. ""We mitigated the impact of inflation through a mix of value engineering, cost-saving initiatives, and judicious price increases, keeping the competitive intensity in mind,"" said Ankush Jain, CFO at Dabur India.Coconut oil is on the boil globally, with prices hitting a record high. Earlier this month, the benchmark wholesale price for Filipino coconut oil delivered in Rotterdam rose above $2,700 a metric ton, about 200% higher than the 2000-2020 average, Bloomberg reported. Bad weather hit coconut production in Southeast Asia.The local consumer goods industry is contending with high input cost inflation in a few other commodities, such as cocoa and edible oils, as well. Crude, though, has been soft, giving some relief to firms. FMCG companies have also been struggling with a demand slowdown led by weak urban consumption, which firms hope will see revival going ahead, helped by easing food inflation.The biggest player, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), expects the first half of FY26 to be better than the second half of FY25. Marico's Gupta said that the industry will see better volume growth this FY. ""Urban demand didn't deteriorate further. It's subdued but not stressful,"" Gupta said, adding that companies will have to continue premiumising to sustain growth even in a sluggish environment. ""The extra disposable income that consumers will get through the tax breaks will be spent on upgrading and discretionary, not necessarily only staples,"" said Gupta.","Coconut oil is on the boil globally, with prices hitting a record high.

RBI buys $14 billion in March to stabilise rupee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-buys-14-billion-in-march-to-stabilise-rupee/articleshow/121350241.cms,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India made net spot market purchases of $14.4 billion in March 2025, signalling a concerted effort to stabilise the rupee and inject liquidity into the banking system. This is the highest net purchase in close to four months.These interventions were the outcome of dollar-rupee swaps that helped replenish foreign exchange reserves and reduced net dollar sales for FY25 to $34.5 billion. RBI's FY25 dollar sales were around 14% higher than the $29.6 billion remitted abroad by Indians under the liberalised remittance scheme, largely for travel and education. In March alone, outward remittances under LRS stood at $2.5 billion.The central bank executed $10 billion in dollar-rupee swaps that settled in March, resulting in rupee liquidity injection of nearly Rs 86,000 crore. Such swaps effectively act as short-term borrowing of dollars, as the RBI agrees to resell the dollars to the same counterparties at a later date, with the spread serving as interest income for banks.Apart from augmenting reserves, these swaps ease rupee liquidity pressures. As a result of these operations, foreign exchange reserves climbed $6.6 billion in the final week of March to a five-month high of $665 billion.",The Reserve Bank of India made net spot market purchases of $14.4 billion in March 2025.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated as many as 103 newly redeveloped railway stations under the Indian Railways’ ambitious Amrit Bharat Station Scheme. The initiative is a part of the government’s efforts to modernise railway infrastructure across the country, with a focus on comfort, cleanliness, and connectivity.The Amrit Bharat Station Scheme is a nationwide project aimed at revamping railway stations in step by step manner. Each station is given a customised plan based on its specific needs, with improvements rolled out over time. The goal is to gradually elevate stations to modern standards while preserving their regional character.By making stations more functional, beautiful, and accessible, the scheme hopes to redefine India’s rail travel experience while boosting local economies and urban development.Passengers can expect a significant upgrade in comfort and convenience. Key improvements include:Many stations will also feature executive lounges and dedicated areas for business meetings. The “One Station One Product” initiative will promote local crafts and products through kiosks within the station premises.The scheme also includes beautification efforts, with more greenery and thoughtful design to enhance the look and feel of the stations.The scheme goes beyond cosmetic upgrades. Station buildings are being modernised and designed to connect both sides of the city, making them important urban hubs. Improvements include:The scheme aims to make these stations more than just places to catch a train, transforming them into vibrant community spaces that are shaped by the unique character of the region. Each redevelopment will draw inspiration from local culture, heritage, and architecture, making every station a gateway to the region’s identity.For instance Ahmedabad’s station from the grandeur of the Modhera Sun Temple, Dwarka station will feature design elements inspired by the Dwarkadheesh Temple. In the east, Odisha’s Baleshwar station will carry Jagannath Temple’s essence while in the south, Kumbakonam station will showcase traditional Chola architecture. Gurugram station will embrace a modern look, reflecting its status as an IT hub.This initiative is designed to promote India’s rich tradition of local crafts and produce. Kiosks will showcase and sell items unique to the region, including handlooms and handicrafts, tribal artefacts, embroidered textiles such as chikankari and zari-zardozi and locally grown spices, tea, coffee, and other food products.These stalls will not only give travellers a taste of the region’s heritage but also support local artisans and small businesses.As part of the government’s Sugamya Bharat Mission, Indian railways is working to ensure that stations are accessible to all, including persons with disabilities (Divyangjans) and passengers with reduced mobility.The accessibility guidelines include a wide range of features such as:A detailed set of accessibility guidelines has been developed to make train stations and services more inclusive for people with disabilities (Divyangjans) and passengers with limited mobility. These guidelines cover five key areas: information systems, station facilities such as toilets, drinking water booths, lifts, subways, lighting, and platform design; train coach design both inside and out, including seating arrangements; and a monitoring and feedback system to ensure continuous improvement.The roots of the Amrit Bharat Station Scheme date back to 2021, when Gandhinagar in Gujarat became the first railway station in India to be modernised under the initiative. The revamped station was equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, including a five-star hotel built within the premises, a first for Indian Railways. Later that same year, Bhopal’s Habibganj station was transformed and renamed Rani Kamalapati Station, setting another example of modern, passenger-friendly infrastructure.","The Amrit Bharat Station Scheme is a nationwide project aimed at revamping railway stations in step by step manner.

Sales of previously owned homes in the US declined for the second month in a row in April, marking the slowest April pace since 2009, as elevated mortgage rates and record prices continued to squeeze out potential buyers.The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported that existing home sales fell 0.5% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million units.Compared to April last year, sales were down 2%, and the figure fell short of economists’ expectations of 4.10 million units, according to FactSet.April’s performance follows a persistent trend of sluggish activity in the US housing market. “The affordability condition is clearly hurting the market, particularly higher mortgage rates,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR, as quoted by news agency AP.Home sales have hovered at roughly 75% of pre-pandemic levels since 2022 when rates started rising from record lows.Prices continue to rise, albeit more slowly. The median home price hit $414,000 last month, up 1.8% from April 2023, the highest for any April on record. This marked the 22nd consecutive month of annual price increases, though the gain was the smallest since July 2023.The average rate on a 30-year mortgage climbed to 6.86% this week, up from 6.81% last week and nearing the year’s high of just over 7%, reported AP.These high borrowing costs are deterring many first-time buyers, even as inventory increases.The number of unsold homes rose to 1.45 million in April, a 20.8% jump from the same month last year and the highest since September 2020. However, this remains below the 2 million homes typical before the pandemic.Buyers who can navigate the tough market, either through savings or cash offers, are still active.First-time buyers accounted for 34% of April’s sales, the highest since July 2020, while cash buyers made up 25% of transactions, down from 28% a year earlier. Investor purchases also dipped to 15% from 16%.The increased supply means homes are sitting on the market longer. Properties typically spent 29 days on the market in April, up from 26 days a year earlier. The unsold inventory equates to a 4.4-month supply, up from 3.5 months in April 2023, but still shy of the 5 to 6 months seen as a balanced market.Economists quoted by AP say mortgage rates are expected to remain volatile through 2024, likely staying within a 6% to 7% range. This instability, driven by Treasury yield movements and broader economic uncertainty, suggests homebuyers may continue facing affordability challenges during the year’s busiest buying season.","Existing home sales fell 0.5% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million units.

When will Trump’s $5 million gold card visa be launched? US Commerce Secretary Lutnick provides big update,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/when-will-trumps-5-million-gold-card-visa-be-launched-us-commerce-secretary-lutnick-provides-big-update/articleshow/121344096.cms,"What is the Gold Card visa scheme?

International investors with at least $5 million in capital will have access to a new ""gold card"" visa programme in about a week, granting permanent residency and work authorization in the United States, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced on Wednesday.Speaking at Axios’ Building the Future event in Washington, DC, Lutnick revealed that the initiative, introduced by President Donald Trump, aims to attract high-net-worth individuals to invest in the country in exchange for a streamlined path to US residency. “I expect there will be a website up called TrumpCard.gov in about a week,” Lutnick said, as reported by CNN. “The details of that will come soon after, but people can start to register,"" he added.While full specifics of the programme will be disclosed in the coming weeks, Lutnick confirmed that it is intended to replace the existing EB-5 Immigrant Investor Programme. Under the current EB-5 scheme, green cards are available to foreign investors who contribute $1.8 million to the US economy—or $900,000 in designated economically distressed areas.The proposed ""gold card"" would require a significantly higher investment of $5 million but would offer expanded privileges, including a route to US citizenship.Trump had first proposed this visa in February earlier this year. “We’re going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million,” he said in an announcement from the Oval Office. “That’s going to give you green card privileges, plus it’s going to be a route to citizenship. And wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card,"" he further stated.Lutnick suggested that interest in the programme is already strong, particularly among high-net-worth individuals abroad. Referring to a recent trip to the Middle East, he said, “Basically, everyone I meet who is not an American is going to want to buy this card- if they have the fiscal capacity.”He also framed the initiative as part of a broader economic strategy, claiming it could help reduce the US federal debt, which currently exceeds $36 trillion. “These are going to be great people who are going to come and bring businesses and opportunity to America, and they’re going to pay $5 million,” he said adding, “If there are 200,000 people who pay, that’s a trillion dollars. That pays for everything.”However, immigration experts have noted that creating a new visa category would require approval from the US Congress, raising questions about the legal and legislative feasibility of the plan.The US Gold Card initiative, priced at $5 million, is proposed as a successor to the existing EB-5 immigrant investor visa scheme.The EB-5 programme, established in 1990, currently enables foreign nationals to secure green cards through business investments. The qualifying criteria include a minimum investment of $1 million in a business venture, or $800,000 in economically disadvantaged regions, with the requirement to create at least 10 jobs.In 2024, authorities granted over 4,500 EB-5 visas. The proposed Gold Card programme, according to Trump's announcement, would operate without any numerical restrictions on issuance.Further details, including eligibility criteria and implementation timelines, are expected to be released by the Commerce Department in the coming weeks.","US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced a new visa programme on Wednesday.

Wall Street slips as US bond market worries intensify after House passes Trump tax bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-slips-as-us-bond-market-worries-intensify-after-house-passes-trump-tax-bill/articleshow/121343139.cms,"AI-generated image

NEW YORK: US stocks slipped in early Thursday trading amid growing concerns over rising government debt and surging Treasury yields, following House approval of President Donald Trump ’s sweeping tax cut legislation.The S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent in early trade, putting it on track for its worst week in two months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 101 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 41,829.75 around 9.35 am Eastern time, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2 per cent to 19,535.10.The pullback comes after a turbulent week driven by volatility in the bond market, the epicentre of investor anxiety. Yields on government debt spiked in response to fiscal concerns, with the 10-year US Treasury climbing as high as 4.63 per cent before edging back to 4.59 per cent. The 30-year bond yield also rose, reaching 5.12 per cent. Rising yields reflect investor unease over the US government’s growing debt load and are seen as a headwind for equity valuations and borrowing costs.Swissquote Bank analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya said the spike in yields is “the market’s way of signaling a lack of confidence in the US government and its policy direction.”The tax legislation approved by the House aims to extend around $4.5 trillion in tax cuts from Trump's 2017 plan while introducing additional reductions.However, it also scales back clean energy subsidies and includes cuts to certain social programmes. The bill is expected to undergo substantial revisions in the Senate before potentially reaching the president’s desk.Investors are cautious about the long-term economic implications of the tax bill, particularly its projected impact on the national debt. Higher Treasury yields not only increase borrowing costs for the government but also ripple through the broader economy—raising expenses for households and businesses, and dampening appetite for riskier assets like equities.Sector-specific losses were also notable. Solar energy stocks took a hit following the proposed rollback of production tax credits. Sunrun plunged 40 per cent, Enphase Energy dropped 16.5 per cent, and First Solar fell 4 per cent. Health care shares declined after the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced an immediate expansion of Medicare Advantage audits. UnitedHealth Group fell 1.4 per cent, while Humana slid 3.6 per cent.Global markets mirrored the cautious sentiment. France’s CAC 40 declined 1.1 per cent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.2 per cent, and South Korea’s Kospi also shed 1.2 per cent in one of the day’s sharper losses.","The S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent in early trade, putting it on track for its worst week in two months.

Donald Trump's trade policy volatility deters business investment; could trigger global slowdown: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-trade-policy-tariff-volatility-deters-business-investment-could-trigger-global-slowdown-reportn-nomura-report/articleshow/121338421.cms,"NEW DELHI: Increased trade tariff uncertainty under US President Donald Trump is prompting businesses to delay or scale back investments, potentially paving the way for a global economic slowdown , according to a comprehensive analysis by Nomura Research Institute The report warns that the unpredictability of US trade and foreign policy is already dampening investor sentiment and could have prolonged repercussions on global markets. “Businesses are likely to shelve, scale back, or delay new investments as long as concerns remain elevated, and that has the potential to trigger a global economic slowdown or recession,” the report stated.Nomura categorised the Trump administration’s tariff strategy into three phases- shock, backlash, and tactical recalibration, highlighting that the erratic nature of policymaking continues to pose systemic risks.Following the April 2 announcement of steep reciprocal tariffs, financial markets experienced what the report called an unusual “triple decline”, a simultaneous drop in US equities, Treasury bonds, and the dollar. ""The reciprocal tariff announcement sparked a triple decline in stocks, bonds, and the US dollar. This suggests that at least some investors decided to sell their dollar-denominated assets,” it added.The report noted that volatility in trade costs and the risk of abrupt policy changes are deterring organisations from committing to long-term investments. Many firms are now incorporating extreme tariff scenarios into their strategic planning, which could restrict capital flows for years to come.Trump’s broader geopolitical approach is adding layers of complexity. His attempts to isolate China through outreach to North Korea and Russia have largely fallen flat, with Beijing countering by offering economic incentives to maintain regional alliances.Looking ahead, Nomura suggests a possible policy pivot. As tariffs become politically contentious, Trump may shift his focus toward addressing trade imbalances through currency adjustments, a move that could introduce fresh instability into global foreign exchange markets.Some currencies, such as the Taiwanese dollar, have already appreciated significantly in anticipation of potential US pressure.Overall, the report gives a cautious outlook: global economic and financial conditions could remain strained if policy uncertainty persists and investment sentiment continues to deteriorate.","Nomura categorised the Trump administration’s tariff strategy into three phases- shock, backlash, and tactical recalibration.

About Vaibhav Taneja

Vaibhav Taneja, the chief financial officer of Elon Musk-led Tesla, is in the news. The 47-year old Indian origin executive has garnered significant attention after his compensation details were revealed on Tuesday. Taneja received $139 million in 2024, which notably exceeds the pay of top tech leaders such as Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Google's Sundar Pichai Sundar Pichai received a total compensation of $10.73 million from Alphabet, Google's parent organisation, whilst Microsoft gave Satya Nadella $79.1 million in 2024.Experts have noted that the substantial sum of $139 million encompasses various forms of compensation beyond direct salary. Taneja's basic salary at Tesla was $400,000 (Rs 3.33 crore). The remainder consisted of stock options and equity linked to performance metrics. When the equity benefits were realised, Tesla's share price stood at $250.Also Read | Tesla India entry: Why Donald Trump has said it would be ‘very unfair’ for Elon Musk’s Tesla to set up a factory in India ""For the year 2024, this headline figure included a cash remuneration of only $303,864,"" said Dhruv Janssen-Sanghavi, international taxation expert and founder of Janssen-Sanghavi & Associates.""The other elements included an equity award and equity options. The value of these stocks on the day on which he acquires them over and above the discounted price he must pay for them would also count as his remuneration,” he told ET.Vaibhav Taneja completed his Bachelor of Commerce from Delhi University in 1999, followed by chartered accountancy in 2000 and certified public accountancy in 2006. Following the acquisition of SolarCity by Musk in 2016, Taneja who worked in the former company transitioned to Tesla, beginning as an assistant corporate controller before advancing to his present position. Previously, he had 17 years of experience at PwC, working across India and the US offices.Since joining Tesla in 2017, Vaibhav Taneja rose through the ranks. He became chief accounting officer by 2019, and in 2023, assumed the role of chief financial officer, overseeing Tesla's worldwide financial operations.His tenure as CFO spans more than two years, during which he has significantly contributed to Tesla's India-focused initiatives. In January 2021, he was designated as a director for Tesla India Motors and Energy Pvt. Ltd, the organisation's Indian subsidiary.Following Zach Kirkhorn's resignation, Taneja stepped into the CFO position. According to an industry expert, Taneja was clearly the most suitable candidate for the role, particularly given Tesla's preference for internal promotions over external recruitment.Also Read | ‘Elon Musk doing amazing work, but…’: Why Sajjan Jindal believes Tesla won’t find it easy in India Notably, Taneja isn't the first person of Indian origin to serve as Tesla's CFO.

""He was always very calm, collected and grounded and had absolutely no airs. His approach was always very practical and that is something that is extremely necessary in a place like Tesla where things can change overnight. His rise is very much of a function of his ability as well as Tesla's meritocratic culture.""Taneja’s remarkable achievements have led to discussions about Indian-origin executives' potential to excel beyond technology sectors in leading organisations, without necessarily possessing engineering qualifications, unlike the typical pattern observed with prominent leaders such as Pichai and Nadella.","Vaibhav Taneja, the chief financial officer of Elon Musk-led Tesla, is in the news.

This marks a downward revision from the earlier prediction of 0.4 per cent growth, made in November under the previous administration.Germany's economy has now shrunk for two consecutive years, and hasn't posted notable growth in five years, AP reported.“Trump's tariff policy is increasing uncertainty and endangering economic growth worldwide,” said Monika Schnitzer, chair of the advisory panel. She noted, however, that a major investment package unveiled by Merz’s coalition government “offers opportunities for a modernization of infrastructure in Germany and a return to a higher path of growth.”Chancellor Merz has vowed to cut red tape, boost digitization, introduce corporate tax incentives, and promote expanded European trade agreements to stimulate economic revival.Germany, once a global export powerhouse in industrial machinery and luxury vehicles, has seen its competitive edge eroded by rising Chinese competition and weakening global demand.

"IEA warns of growing global dependence on few nations for critical minerals, highlights China’s dominance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/iea-warns-of-growing-global-dependence-on-few-nations-for-critical-minerals-highlights-chinas-dominance/articleshow/121319416.cms,"The global supply of critical minerals essential for clean energy technologies is becoming increasingly concentrated in a handful of countries, particularly China, posing a significant risk to global economic stability, according to a report released Wednesday by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ).The Paris-based agency’s “Global Critical Minerals Outlook” highlights the strategic vulnerabilities stemming from the limited diversification of key mineral sources—such as copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite, and rare earth elements—which are crucial for manufacturing electric vehicles, batteries, wind turbines, and other clean energy infrastructure.The report found that the market share held by the top three producing countries for these minerals rose to 86 per cent in 2024, up from 82 per cent in 2020. China, in particular, has solidified its position as the world’s leading refiner for 19 of the 20 most critical minerals, with an average global refining share of around 75 per cent. Indonesia has also emerged as a key player in nickel production, driven by its expanding role in stainless steel and battery component manufacturing.“Critical mineral supply chains can be highly vulnerable to supply shocks, be they from extreme weather, a technical failure, or trade disruptions,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.“The impact of a supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness.”Birol pointed to the energy crisis in Europe following Russia’s gas supply cuts and the global chip shortage during the pandemic as recent examples of the devastating effects of supply chain disruptions.“The golden rule of energy security is diversification,” Birol told The Associated Press. “And it goes beyond energy security — it is also economic security.”While markets play an important role in driving investment and innovation, Birol emphasized that government intervention through strategic policies and financing will be necessary to ensure resilience and meet rising global demand.The IEA’s findings arrive amid rising global tensions around trade and resource control. China’s tightened export restrictions on several strategic minerals have escalated concerns among Western nations about supply vulnerability, especially as clean energy goals ramp up.Former US President Donald Trump, now back in office, has prioritized reducing America’s dependence on foreign mineral supplies. His administration recently finalized a controversial deal with Ukraine to access its vast mineral reserves and is actively exploring deep-sea mining, despite environmental opposition.Trump has also issued executive orders to fast-track domestic copper mining, reviewed a minerals agreement with the Democratic Republic of Congo, and attempted to secure mineral supplies from Greenland. These actions are part of his broader agenda to reinforce national security and economic resilience by diversifying supply chains and boosting domestic production.The IEA noted that global critical mineral markets are currently well-supplied, and prices have generally declined. However, it issued a stark warning that planned global copper production is falling behind projected demand, forecasting a 30 per cent supply shortfall by 2030. Copper is vital for electrical grids, renewable energy systems, and infrastructure electrification.The agency stressed the importance of accelerating investment in new mining projects, refining capabilities, and recycling technologies, while also establishing robust trade partnerships and reducing overreliance on any single nation.As the global economy shifts toward clean energy, the need for secure, transparent, and sustainable mineral supply chains will only intensify, the IEA concluded.","The top three producing countries for these minerals rose to 86% in 2024, up from 82% in 2020.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 816.80 points, or 1.91%, to 41,860.44. The S&P 500 slid 95.85 points, or 1.61%, to 5844.61, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 270.07 points, or 1.41%, to 18,872.64.The pullback across major indices comes as markets remain on edge over the Federal Reserve’s interest rate outlook. Treasury yields continued to rise, with the benchmark 10-year US note yielding 4.543%, up 6.2 basis points. Higher yields tend to pressure equity valuations, particularly for growth and tech stocks, which are more sensitive to borrowing costs.In commodities, gold and oil prices saw modest gains. Gold rose by $24.50, or 0.75%, to $3,309.10 per ounce, as investors looked to hedge against market uncertainty. Oil also advanced, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude climbing $0.69, or 1.11%, to $62.72 per barrel, supported by expectations of tighter global supply.Market volatility also picked up, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rising 6.52% to 19.27.In currency markets, the euro edged higher against the US dollar, with the EUR/USD pair up 0.43% to 1.133, reflecting diverging central bank policy outlooks between the US and the eurozone.US stock futures declined early Wednesday as disappointing corporate earnings and ongoing trade concerns weighed on investor sentiment. Futures for the S&P 500 were down 0.5%, while those for the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8%. Nasdaq futures also fell by 0.5%, signaling a soft start to the trading session.Retail giant Target reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter sales and issued a cautious outlook for the year, citing pressure from consumer pullback driven by trade uncertainty and tariff concerns. The company now expects a low-single-digit decline in sales for 2025, with adjusted earnings per share between $7 and $9 — a downgrade from its previous forecast of $8.80 to $9.80 made in March.Target’s revised guidance echoes growing concern across the retail sector, where companies are grappling with tariff-related costs and unclear economic signals. While Walmart recently acknowledged potential price hikes to offset import taxes, investors are closely watching whether further tariff rollbacks from President Donald Trump may offer relief. Markets have rebounded in recent weeks, supported by Trump’s decision to pause or reduce some of the tariffs as trade negotiations progress.Not all retail news was negative. Lowe’s posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue, reaffirming its full-year forecast and lifting investor confidence in the home improvement sector.Meanwhile, oil prices rose nearly 1% following reports from CNN citing intelligence officials who believe Israel may be preparing an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. Any escalation in Middle East tensions typically lifts oil prices due to potential disruptions in supply. US benchmark crude rose 50 cents to $62.53 per barrel, while Brent crude climbed 48 cents to $65.86.President Trump has also warned of possible military action against Iran if nuclear talks fail.

UK inflation hits 3.5% in April amid soaring household bills and tax pressures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-inflation-hits-3-5-in-april-amid-soaring-household-bills-and-tax-pressures/articleshow/121316034.cms,"Inflation in the UK surged to its highest level since January 2024 in April, driven by sharp increases in domestic bills such as energy and water, official data revealed on Wednesday.The Office for National Statistics reported that the consumer prices index rose to 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to April, up from 2.6 per cent in March — surpassing economists’ expectations of a rise to 3.3 per cent, news agency AP reported.This marks the steepest monthly inflation jump since October 2022, during the height of the global energy crisis following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Economists had anticipated a notable rise in April due to substantial annual increases in utility costs, higher business taxes, and a significant boost to the minimum wage.With inflation expected to remain above 3 per cent for the rest of 2025, prospects for additional interest rate cuts by the Bank of England may diminish. The central bank, which targets a 2 per cent inflation rate, has been gradually reducing rates since last August from a 16-year high of 5.25 per cent. Earlier this month, it lowered the main rate to 4.25 per cent.Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill, speaking on Tuesday, expressed concern that borrowing rates may have been cut too swiftly, highlighting persistent underlying inflation pressures.Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that further rate cuts following a “precise quarterly schedule” are now “far from certain.”Although inflation is set to stay above target this year, economists expect it to ease in 2026, partly due to the recent UK-U.S. trade deal that scrapped several planned tariffs introduced during the Trump administration.The sudden jump in inflation presents a political challenge for the Labour government, which returned to power last July after 14 years. The party has recently emphasized signs of economic progress, including stronger-than-expected Q1 growth and a series of trade deals — not only with the US, but also with India and the European Union.“I am disappointed with these figures, because I know cost of living pressures are still weighing down on working people,"" said Treasury chief Rachel Reeves.The Conservative Party, now in opposition, blamed the inflation spike on Labour’s fiscal policies.“Families are paying the price for the Labour Chancellor’s choices,"" said Mel Stride, the Tories' economy spokesman.","Consumer prices index rose to 3.5% in the 12 months to April, up from 2.6% in March.

How India’s boycott of Turkish products & services may aggravate Turkey’s dire economic state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-indias-boycott-of-turkish-products-services-may-aggravate-turkeys-dire-economic-state/articleshow/121314302.cms,"India's Stern Message To Pak Ally Erdogan Amid 'Boycott Turkey' Chorus: Expect | Watch

The widespread boycott call by Indian citizens and businesses on Turkish products and services, which was caused by Turkey's blatant support of Pakistan in the conflict that erupted after Operation Sindoor is expected to aggravate further the dire economic problems faced by ordinary Turks due mainly to rampant inflation and the devaluation of the Turkish Lira.Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has always supported Pakistan's claims in Kashmir, rportedly supplied more than 350 drones and some military operatives to Pakistan during the conflict.In a message to Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Erdogan reiterated his support for Pakistan saying, ""As in the past, we will continue to stand by you in good times and bad in the future.""This uncalled-for intervention in a conflict far away from Turkey's borders in which Ankara has absolutely no reason to get involved as well as its attempt to change its outcome, by helping to coordinate Pakistani drone strikes on India, has greatly angered the Indian people and businessmen who decided to stop importing goods and services from Turkey and sever business relations with Turkish traders and manufacturers.Already, major tourist platforms reported a 60 per cent reduction in bookings by Indians in holidays in Turkey and a more than 250 per cent increase in cancellations. As in 2024 this number stood at 3,30,100 visitors, the cancellations could mean dozens of millions in lost revenue.According to Indian Brand Equity Foundation, India's imports from Turkey stood at USD 3.78 billion in 2023-24. Furthermore, the Indian government has cancelled a USD 2.3 billion shipbuilding deal.Also, Turkish Firms like Celebi Aviation that operate ground handling at key airports would be replaced by local or international partners from other countries, while Turkish contractors will be gradually phased out from public works in India.It should be mentioned that according to the United Nations COMTRADE database on international trade in 2024, Turkish exports to Pakistan amounted to USD 918.22 million, and cannot compensate for the loss of exports to India.Undoubtedly, the boycott will deprive Turkey of desperately needed foreign exchange and trade with one of the world's biggest economies and strain its diplomatic ties with India, but it will also affect other important sectors such partnerships between Turkish and Indian universities, like the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Millia Islamia University and Kota University.There is no doubt that the Turkish economy is facing one of the most serious economic crises in Turkey's recent history, with extremely high inflation, while the Turkish Lira has sunk to unprecedented lows. Ordinary people find it very hard to buy food and pay the skyrocketing rents prevailing in major towns and are becoming increasingly desperate.According to the latest real estate rent index calculated by the OECD based on March results, rental fee inflation in Turkey recorded the highest rate among OECD members reaching 96.25 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared to the previous quarter.Erdogan's misguided economic policies, such as his insistence on keeping interest rates unrealistically low, his public spending spree and his penchant for constructing mega projects- which he always awards to his cronies - as well as his government's disastrous intervention in markets, have depleted the country's foreign exchange reserves and state coffers.The Turkish lira has fallen to a new record low of 38.7 per USD as investors worry about the country's political and economic outlook, while Turkey's Central Bank continues to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the currency. The sharp depreciation of the Turkish Lira, instead of boosting exports as Erdogan hoped, has only contributed to a loss of real wages and a declining standard of living for the Turkish people.It is noted that last March the Lira fell to a record low of 40 to 1 USD following the arrest on trumped-up charges of Istanbul's popular Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, President Erdogan's main political rival, who continues to be in jail. The incident triggered the largest protests in Turkey in a decade and raised worries about deepening political instability.Major credit agencies such as Moody's, Fitch and S&P have downgraded Turkey's sovereign debt rating to near junk status, warning of heightened risks of default.As Erdogan's follows unorthodox economic and monetary policies, foreign direct investment (FDI), which used to be a strong pillar of the Turkish economy, has plummeted and foreign firms which in the past considered Turkey as an attractive market are now quite reluctant to invest.According to official figures released by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) annual consumer price inflation slowed to 38.01 per cent in March 2025, down from a peak of around 75 per cent in May of the previous year. However, independent institutes as well as many citizens believe that in reality, inflation is much higher than that.For the majority of ordinary Turks, as a result of high inflation and the devaluation of the currency, which makes imported goods much more expensive, necessities such as food, fuel and housing have become increasingly unaffordable.Erdogan's insistence on implementing his unorthodox monetary policies and the Indian boycott of Turkish products triggered by Ankara's intervention in the conflict between India and Pakistan will undoubtedly make the life of ordinary Turks much more difficult.","The widespread boycott call by Indian citizens and businesses on Turkish products and services was caused by Turkey's blatant support of Pakistan in the conflict that erupted after Operation Sindoor.

"World's supply of critical minerals concentrated in fewer countries, including China, leaves global economy vulnerable: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/worlds-supply-of-critical-minerals-concentrated-in-fewer-countries-including-china-leaves-global-economy-vulnerable-report/articleshow/121314557.cms,"(Photo credit: AP)

The world's supply of critical minerals needed for clean energy is becoming more concentrated in a few countries, especially China, raising concerns about economic vulnerability and potential supply disruptions, according to a new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Wednesday.The report analysed the supply of key minerals and metals that, although used in small amounts, are crucial for the shift from fossil fuels to electricity and renewable energy. The research further revealed that for copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements, the combined market share of the top three producing nations increased to 86% in 2024 from 82% in 2020.China refines 19 out of the 20 key minerals studied in the report, holding about 75% of the global market share. Indonesia has also made strong progress in producing nickel, which is important for making steel and batteries for electric vehicles.The IEA expressed concerns about increasing export limitations and trade conflicts. ""Critical mineral supply chains can be highly vulnerable to supply shocks, be they from extreme weather, a technical failure or trade disruptions,"" the IEA executive director Fatih Birol told The Associated Press.""The impact of a supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness,"" Birol noted.Birol further cited Europe's energy crisis following Russia's natural gas supply reduction over the Ukraine conflict. He also mentioned the global silicon-based computer chip shortage during and after the pandemic that affected automobile production.China is a major global supplier of critical minerals used in products like computer chips, electric vehicles, batteries, drones, robots, and military equipment. It also leads in refining and processing key minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and graphite.In recent years, China has tightened export controls on many of these materials, especially during trade tensions with the US under President Donald Trump.These restrictions have made it harder for US industries to find alternative sources, affecting their competitiveness and increasing pressure on global supply chains.Trump has prioritised reducing US reliance on foreign critical minerals as a fundamental component of his first 100 days back in office, as part of national security and economic resilience initiatives.The situation extends beyond China; the Trump administration recently concluded a complex agreement with Ukraine, securing American access to their substantial mineral resources.Trump has pushed for deep-sea mining in international waters, despite opposition from environmental groups. He has also called for expanding the domestic copper industry through a February executive order and urged faster approvals for new mining projects.Trump reviewed a mining proposal from the mineral-rich but conflict-prone Congo and even tried to pressure Greenland into supplying more minerals to the US.Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that while global markets currently have adequate mineral supplies and prices are generally down, copper production is not expected to meet future demand. The agency warned of a possible 30% shortfall in copper—vital for electric wiring and power grids—by 2030.","China refines 19 out of the 20 key minerals studied in the report, holding about 75% of the global market share.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

"Crypto isn’t dead, it’s evolving rapidly to create a new world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-isnt-dead-its-evolving-rapidly-to-create-a-new-world/articleshow/101324954.cms,"Regulatory landscape



There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online. “Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN



NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance.

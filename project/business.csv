Waaree Energies has shown notable resilience over the past few weeks and is currently consolidating in a tight range. The overall trend remains strongly bullish. The stock is now on the verge of a breakout, with ₹2745 being the key level to watch. A decisive move above this can trigger a sharp up-move towards ₹3000–3100. Traders are advised to initiate fresh longs above ₹2700, keeping a stop-loss at ₹2550 and targeting ₹3000 in the near term.Premier Energies had witnessed a breakout above ₹950 around 16th April, followed by a rally towards ₹1100. Post this move, the stock has retested its breakout level and has now reclaimed its medium-term EMAs. A fresh range breakout has also been observed on the hourly charts, indicating a potential resumption of the uptrend. Traders can consider buying near ₹1000, with a stop-loss at ₹920, and aim for a target of ₹1160.GMMP Faudler appears deeply oversold and is showing a classic positive RSI divergence on the weekly timeframe.On the daily chart, a double bottom formation is visible around the ₹990 zone. These signals collectively point to a high-probability bounce setup. Traders may look to enter around ₹1070 with a stop-loss at ₹990, targeting ₹1230 on the upside.","According to Mehul Kothari, DVP - Technical Research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, Waaree Energies, Premier Energie, and GMMP Faudler are the top stocks to buy today.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121137329,imgsize-77878,width-400,resizemode-4/121137329.jpg"

Piyush Goyal to lead delegation to US for key trade talks from May 17,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/piyush-goyal-to-lead-delegation-to-us-for-key-trade-talks-from-may-17/articleshow/121144967.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union minister Piyush Goyal will head to Washington from May 17, leading a delegation of senior Indian officials for talks with US counterparts regarding the proposed bilateral trade agreement (BTA), according to an official's statement on Tuesday.During the four-day visit from May 17 to 20, the Commerce and Industry minister is expected to meet with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick to discuss ways to advance the agreement.The talks come as both countries work toward an interim trade deal focused on goods to secure ""early mutual wins"" before finalising the first phase of the broader agreement by September–October this year.Chief negotiators from both sides will continue discussions from May 19 to 22. Key issues on the table include market access, rules of origin, and non-tariff barriers.The talks will address India's proposed retaliatory duties on select US products, responding to American tariffs on steel and aluminium. Officials from both capitals aim to utilise the 90-day tariff pause period to progress in negotiations.The US has temporarily suspended the additional 26 per cent tariffs on India until July 9, announced on April 2 to address the growing trade deficit.The standard 10 per cent baseline tariff remains applicable to the countries.Earlier in March, Goyal conducted bilateral meetings with Greer and Lutnick. Both nations have begun sector-specific discussions for the agreement, covering both tariff and non-tariff matters.India seeks duty reductions for labour-intensive sectors including textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods, garments, plastics, chemicals, shrimp, oil seeds, chemicals, grapes, and bananas in the proposed US agreement.The US is pursuing duty concessions in sectors such as industrial goods, automobiles (particularly electric vehicles), wines, petrochemical products, dairy, agriculture items including apples, and tree nuts.The BTA's terms of reference, agreed upon by both nations, encompass 19 chapters addressing tariffs, goods, services, rules of origin, non-tariff barriers, and customs facilitation.The US has frequently expressed concerns about certain non-tariff barriers affecting American goods in Indian markets.The United States stands as India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $129 billion in 2024. India maintains a trade surplus of $45.7 billion with the US.Goyal’s visit comes after US Vice President JD Vance’s trip to New Delhi last month and is part of renewed efforts to secure a trade deal that would help avoid US tariffs and strengthen ties with President Donald Trump’s administration.During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US in February, both countries agreed to work toward finalising the first phase of a trade deal by fall 2025, with a goal of boosting bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.","Union minister Piyush Goyal will head to Washington from May 17 to 20.

Income tax department notifies all 7 ITR forms for AY 2025-26; Check key changes in capital gains reporting and disclosure norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/income-tax-department-notifies-all-7-itr-forms-for-ay-2025-26-check-key-changes-in-capital-gains-reporting-and-disclosure-norms/articleshow/121117524.cms,"Income tax department has notified all seven Income Tax Return (ITR) forms for the assessment year 2025-26. While ITR Forms 1 and 4, used by small and medium taxpayers, were notified on April 29, ITR-7, applicable for trusts and charitable institutions, was notified on May 11.One important change has been introduced in ITR-1 and ITR-4, notified on April 29, relating to the reporting of capital gains income from listed equities, as reported by news agency PTI.Now, salaried individuals and those under the presumptive taxation scheme, having long-term capital gains (LTCG) of up to Rs 1.25 lakh in a financial year, will be able to file ITR-1 and ITR-4, respectively. Earlier, such persons/entities were required to file ITR-2.Under the Income Tax law, LTCG of up to Rs 1.25 lakh from the sale of listed shares and mutual funds is exempt from tax. Gains exceeding Rs 1.25 lakh per annum are subject to 12.5 per cent tax.The last date for filing ITR for individuals and those who do not have to get their accounts audited is July 31.One change which has been introduced in ITR forms 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 pertains to rationalisation of capital gains tax. In Schedule Capital Gains of the ITR, capital gains must now be split based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024.In the Budget presented on July 24, 2024, the government had proposed to lower long-term capital gains tax on real estate to 12.5 per cent without indexation benefit, from 20 per cent with indexation.Indexation benefit allows taxpayers to arrive at the cost price of the property after adjusting for inflation.With this, individuals or HUFs who purchased houses before July 23, 2024, can opt to pay Long Term Capital Gain (LTCG) tax under the new scheme at the rate of 12.5 per cent without indexation or claim the indexation benefit and pay 20 per cent tax.Also, in ITR-3, which is filed by individuals and HUFs having income from profits and gains of business or profession, the threshold for reporting assets and liabilities under 'Schedule AL' has been raised from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore, thus reducing the disclosure burden on middle-income taxpayers.ITR Form 1 (Sahaj) and ITR Form 4 (Sugam) are simpler forms that cater to a large number of small and medium taxpayers.Sahaj can be filed by a resident individual having annual income of up to Rs 50 lakh and who receives income from salary, one house property, other sources (interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000 a year.Sugam can be filed by individuals, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), and firms (other than Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs)) having a total annual income of up to Rs 50 lakh and income from business and profession.ITR-2 is filed by individuals and HUFs not having income from profits and gains in business or profession, but having income from capital gains.ITR-5 is filed by firms, Limited Liability Partnerships, and Cooperative Societies. ITR-6 is filed by companies registered under the Companies Act. ITR-7 is filed by trusts and charitable institutions.","ITR Forms 1 and 4, used by small and medium taxpayers, were notified on April 29. ITR-7, applicable for trusts and charitable institutions, was notified on May 11. The last date for filing ITR for individuals and those who do not have to get their accounts audited is July 31.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121117572,imgsize-339145,width-400,resizemode-4/121117572.jpg"

MUMBAI: The India-UK free trade agreement will benefit Jaguar Land Rover 's future cars, as customers will be able to access them much faster, driving its performance in India, said the company's top executive.""The current cars already in India, the Range Rover franchise-Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, Evoque, and the Velar-are being manufactured in India on a CKD (completely knocked down) basis, so they won't be impacted by this FTA that is coming in,"" said director PB Balaji. ""This will benefit future cars, meaning customers will be able to access these global cars at global prices much faster.""Under the FTA, a fully-built car imported from the UK will be levied a 10% duty as against the existing 100%. JLR sold 6,183 vehicles in India in FY25.Regarding the US-UK trade deal , Balaji said, ""The situation is much better than what we were facing before. We await the fine print in terms of timings, whether it's applicable retrospectively or not. We also need a few clarifications in terms of what is due to parts and accessories.""The trade deal reduces tariffs on UK-built vehicles exported to the US to 10% from 27.5%, within a quota of one lakh vehicles. Any export beyond this quota will face the 27.5% tariff.The US accounts for a quarter of JLR's sales. It recently restarted shipments to the US after pausing them following the US's 27.5% tariffs on foreign-built vehicles that came into effect on April 3.""Whatever was shipped to the US will not have any impact if it is going to be a retrospective effect, as we will continue shipping from here on. We will have to wait to quantify the impact of the change in tariffs,"" Balaji said. The US tariff impacted Defender, one of JLR's most sold models in the US, as it is manufactured in Nitra, Slovakia. ""We remain optimistic that there will be a deal done between the EU and US as well, just like what happened between the UK and US,"" Balaji said.","The India-UK free trade agreement will benefit Jaguar Land Rover's future cars.

NEW DELHI: In a push to promote domestic shipbuilding and meet the growing demand, government is set to provide support of over Rs 20,000 crore for rollout of the second phase of Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Policy and developing four greenfield shipbuilding and repair hubs in the next six years.For shipbuilding and repair hubs, four land parcels of 2,000-3,000 acres each, have been identified in Odisha (Kendrapara near Paradip Port), AP (Dugarajapatnam), Gujarat (Kandla) and TN (Tuticorin) for developing the greenfield shipbuilding and repair hubs, TOI has learnt.The thrust on shipbuilding comes amid a requirement of around 112 ships (estimated cost Rs 85,700 crore) for carrying crude, petroleum products, LPG, LNG, black oil, bitumen and other products in the next five years.

UnitedHealth Group announced Tuesday that CEO Andrew Witty is stepping down for personal reasons as the company grapples with unexpectedly high medical costs and withdraws its full-year financial outlook for 2025.Chairman Stephen Hemsley will return as CEO, effective immediately. Hemsley, who previously served in the role from 2006 to 2017, will continue as chairman of the company’s board. Witty, 60, will remain with the company as a senior adviser, as per news agency AP.UnitedHealth’s decision comes during a turbulent time for the healthcare giant, which has faced growing scrutiny and financial headwinds in recent months. In December, executive Brian Thompson was killed outside a New York City hotel. While the incident was not tied to the company’s financial operations, it sent shockwaves through the corporate world and was followed by a dramatic decline in UnitedHealth shares.“I’m deeply disappointed in and apologize for the performance setbacks we have encountered from both external and internal challenges,” Hemsley said during an early Tuesday conference call.“Many of the issues standing in the way of achieving our goals as well as our opportunities are largely within our control. I am optimistic about our future as these issues are within our capacity to resolve. We will approach them with humility, rigor and urgency. ”Witty joined UnitedHealth in 2018 after a nearly decade-long tenure as CEO of British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. He took over the helm of UnitedHealth in February 2021, succeeding Dave Wichmann.Under Witty’s leadership, UnitedHealth experienced significant growth. The company’s revenue soared to more than $400 billion last year, a 55% jump from the $257 billion it posted the year before he became CEO. Its stock price also surged during that period, rising 60.5%.However, the last several months have marked a period of considerable challenge. UnitedHealth cut its financial forecast last month following its first quarterly earnings miss in over a decade. On Tuesday, the company withdrew its full-year guidance entirely, citing higher-than-expected medical expenses tied to newly enrolled Medicare Advantage members.The backdrop of rising costs and public scrutiny has added to investor unease. The ongoing high-profile case surrounding Luigi Mangione, who was indicted last month on federal murder charges in the death of Thompson, has stirred national attention and contributed to a broader wave of criticism toward health insurers.Shares of UnitedHealth have fallen sharply—down 38% since Thompson’s killing on December 4—plunging more than 16% on Tuesday to their lowest levels in nearly five years.UnitedHealth Group Inc. serves more than 50 million Americans through its various health insurance offerings. In addition to its core insurance operations, it runs a major pharmacy benefit manager and its Optum division, which provides healthcare services and technical infrastructure.The company is also the nation’s largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans, with over 8 million enrollees in privately run versions of the government health program for seniors.","UnitedHealth Group announced Tuesday that CEO Andrew Witty is stepping down for personal reasons.

Wall street rallies on cooling inflation; S&P 500 rebounds to erase 2025 losses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-market-today-wall-street-mixed-as-nasdaq-climbs-dow-slips-despite-cooling-inflations/articleshow/121142523.cms,"Most US stocks climbed on Tuesday following a promising inflation report that showed price pressures unexpectedly eased across the country in April, giving fresh momentum to a market already buoyed by optimism over US-China trade developments.The S&P 500 rose 0.8% in midday trading, building on Monday’s strong performance after the United States and China agreed to a 90-day pause in their tariff dispute to allow for further negotiations. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.6%, powered by strength in artificial intelligence and technology stocks, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, down 152 points, or 0.4%, as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern.The rally helped the S&P 500 erase its year-to-date losses, recovering nearly 20% from its recent lows and moving within 4.1% of its all-time high set in February. The index, a key component of many retirement portfolios, has rebounded amid expectations that the administration may ease tariffs to prevent a deeper economic slowdown and inflationary surge.Tuesday’s inflation data offered relief to markets. The consumer price index rose 2.3% in April compared to a year earlier, down from 2.4% in March. It was a welcome sign for investors worried about the toxic mix of high inflation and stagnant growth — a scenario economists call “stagflation.”“It’s encouraging because such data pulls the economy further from a worst-case scenario called ‘stagflation,’” the report noted. “The Federal Reserve has no good tools to fix the toxic combination. It could try to lower rates to help the economy, for example, but that would likely lead to worse inflation in the short term.”Despite the good news, analysts cautioned that the impact of ongoing tariffs could still push inflation higher in the months ahead, keeping the Federal Reserve in a wait-and-see mode.“It’s similar to the wait that investors in general are enduring,” said Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, global cohead and co-chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “With the Fed set to make no moves on interest rates for the time being, markets will likely trade ‘with negotiation and reconciliation headlines.’”Louis Wong, director for Phillip Securities Group in Hong Kong, echoed the sentiment. “I think investors are aware that the trade deal is not done yet,” he said. “I would advise investors to remain cautious in the near term and to be prepared for unexpected news from the trade front.”On Wall Street , Coinbase Global surged 19.2% after it was announced that the cryptocurrency exchange will be added to the S&P 500 index next week, replacing Discover Financial Services, which is being acquired by Capital One Financial.AI stocks also led the charge. Nvidia gained 5.5%, acting as the largest contributor to the S&P 500’s advance. Super Micro Computer jumped 13%, GE Vernova added 5.6%, and Palantir Technologies climbed 7.3%.The strength in tech and AI helped offset a sharp drop in UnitedHealth Group shares, which plunged 16.1% after the insurer suspended its full-year forecast due to unexpectedly high medical costs. The company also announced that CEO Andrew Witty would step down for personal reasons, with Chairman Stephen Hemsley set to take over as CEO immediately.UnitedHealth's decline was the primary reason for the Dow's underperformance.In the bond market, Treasury yields rose slightly on optimism about the economy. The 10-year Treasury yield inched up to 4.48% from 4.45%, while the two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed policy, ticked up to 4.00% from 3.98%.Overseas, market performance was mixed. Tokyo’s Nikkei rose 1.4%, with automakers among the top gainers. Nissan Motor Co. added 3% ahead of plans to lay off 20,000 workers as part of its restructuring efforts.

US inflation softens to 2.3% in April despite tariffs; Economists caution on future price pressures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-softens-to-2-3-in-april-despite-tariffs-economists-caution-on-future-price-pressures/articleshow/121141873.cms,"US inflation eased for a third consecutive month in April, as falling grocery and gasoline prices offset early impacts from recently imposed tariffs. However, economists caution that price pressures may re-emerge in the coming months as the full effects of trade duties begin to filter through the economy.Consumer prices rose 2.3% in April from a year ago, the Labor Department said Tuesday, down from 2.4% in March and the smallest increase in more than four years. On a monthly basis, prices rose modestly, increasing 0.2% from March to April after falling 0.1% the previous month, the first drop in five years.Grocery prices fell 0.4%, pulled down in part by a big 12.7% drop in the price of eggs. It was the biggest decline in food costs at home since September 2020, the government said.Food prices at home declined 0.4%, with egg prices falling a sharp 12.7%, contributing to the largest single-month drop in grocery prices since September 2020. Energy prices also eased, helping moderate overall inflation.The data indicates that tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump have yet to significantly influence consumer prices. Despite broad-based duties — including 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, a 10% universal tariff enacted on April 2, and previously announced 145% import taxes on Chinese goods (now reduced to 30%) — many product categories saw minimal price changes.Apparel prices declined 0.2%, new car prices remained unchanged, and furniture costs rose 1.5% over the month.“Firms have indicated... that they are unsure how much of the tariff cost increase they can pass through to consumers without denting demand, and we expect some testing of the waters and a staggered pattern of price increases,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, cofounder, Macro Policy Perspectives.Economists suggest that the full impact of tariffs may not be reflected immediately, as many businesses had already stockpiled inventory and some imports were in transit before the duties took effect.Meanwhile, core CPI, which excludes food and energy, increased 2.8% annually, unchanged from March. On a monthly basis, core prices rose 0.3%, up from 0.1% the previous month — a potential signal of building underlying inflation.The White House announced Monday that it had reached a trade agreement with China, reducing tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China also lowered duties on US imports. The agreement includes a 90-day review window, after which 24% tariffs could return if further progress is not made.Despite the deal, the average US tariff remains historically high. The Yale Budget Lab estimates the current average is 18%, the highest since 1934. According to their analysis, tariffs at this level could lift prices by 1.7% and cost the average US household approximately $2,800 per year.Gasoline prices, meanwhile, averaged $3.14 per gallon, according to AAA, contradicting Trump's repeated claims that prices had fallen to $1.98 per gallon nationwide.“Tariffs is the most beautiful word,” Trump has said in support of the policy, suggesting duties will continue to play a central role in his economic strategy.While inflation is currently nearing the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, the combination of persistent tariffs, volatile global trade dynamics, and constrained consumer spending could complicate future monetary policy decisions.“The duties have raised the risk of both higher inflation and higher unemployment,” said Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week. “Two challenges that rarely occur simultaneously.”In such a scenario, the Fed would be forced to balance its dual mandate. Lower interest rates might stimulate growth amid rising joblessness, while elevated inflation typically calls for tighter monetary policy — a contradiction that could restrict the Fed’s room to maneuver.Economists expect more pronounced tariff impacts in the second half of the year, depending on supply chain adjustments, consumer tolerance for higher prices, and further developments in international trade agreements.","Consumer prices rose 2.3% in April from a year ago, down from 2.4% in March and the smallest increase in more than four years.

India plans retaliatory tariffs on US steel and aluminium duties under WTO norms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/india-plans-retaliatory-tariffs-on-us-steel-and-aluminium-duties-under-wto-norms/articleshow/121136657.cms,"India plans retaliatory tariffs on US steel and aluminium duties under WTO norms

India on Monday proposed to impose retaliatory tariffs on US products under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, in response to American safeguard measures on steel and aluminium imports. The move comes as both countries engage in bilateral trade negotiations.According to a formal communication to the WTO, India said the US safeguard tariffs, extended earlier this year, affect Indian exports worth $7.6 billion, and would lead to a duty collection of approximately $1.91 billion. In response, India has proposed to suspend equivalent trade concessions by imposing similar duties on imports from the US.""The proposed suspension of concessions or other obligations takes the form of an increase in tariffs on selected products originating in the United States,"" the WTO document noted. India has notified the WTO's Council for trade in goods of its intent and said it reserves the right to enforce these duties 30 days after the date of the notification, that is, May 9, 2025.The US first imposed 25 per cent tariffs on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium imports in March 2018, invoking national security concerns under Section 232 of its trade laws. While the US maintains these duties are not safeguard measures, India argues otherwise, citing inconsistencies with the general agreement on tariffs and trade (GATT) 1994 and the agreement on safeguards (AoS).India had earlier sought formal consultations with the US under the WTO's dispute settlement framework in April 2025.India contends that since the US revised and extended these tariffs indefinitely in February 2025, the continued imposition of duties is harming Indian exporters and violates multilateral trade norms.The timing of the proposal is crucial as it coincides with India-US bilateral trade negotiations. An Indian delegation is currently in the US for discussions on a potential bilateral trade agreement (BTA). The retaliatory step could cast a shadow over the talks, although both sides have continued dialogue even amid previous disputes.This isn't the first instance of such tensions. India had previously retaliated in June 2019 with higher tariffs on 28 US products including almonds, apples, and walnuts, after the Trump administration imposed the initial steel and aluminium duties in 2018.The WTO filing said that India reserves the right to adjust tariffs, change targeted products, or modify the notification depending on future developments. India also reaffirmed its intention to notify the WTO's committee on safeguards regarding its next steps.","India plans retaliatory tariffs on US steel and aluminium duties under WTO norms.

Nissan Motor Corp is slashing about 15% of its global workforce—around 20,000 employees—and cutting its number of auto plants from 17 to 10, as the Japanese automaker reported a 670.9 billion yen ($4.5 billion) loss for the fiscal year ending in March. The sharp downturn comes amid falling vehicle sales in China and other key markets.The Yokohama-based company outlined the sweeping cuts as part of a broader recovery plan designed to carry out what it called “decisive and bold actions to enhance performance and create a leaner, more resilient business that adapts quickly to market changes.”The company also cited US tariffs on auto imports under President Donald Trump as a factor that hurt its performance, according to news agency AP.Nissan is targeting a cost reduction of 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion) during the next fiscal year, compared to its results from the year that just ended.The 2024 fiscal year loss marks a dramatic reversal from the previous year, when Nissan posted a 426.6 billion yen profit. Restructuring expenses also weighed heavily on its bottom line.Chief Financial Officer Jeremie Papin told reporters the automaker faces serious challenges in achieving a turnaround, but stressed it has enough financial resources to carry it through.“We have enough cash to do so,” he said.Nissan is expected to be the hardest hit by the 25% U.S. import tariff. “Its clientele has historically been more price-sensitive than that of its rivals,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tatsuo Yoshida told AFP, adding that Nissan “can’t pass the costs on to consumers to the same extent as Toyota or Honda without suffering a significant loss in sales units.”As part of its restructuring strategy, Nissan said it will aim to cut costs by 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion) over the next fiscal year. The company described its new direction as a move to implement “decisive and bold actions to enhance performance and create a leaner, more resilient business that adapts quickly to market changes.”""In China, we will strengthen our market performance by unleashing multiple new-energy vehicles,"" Nissan added in a statement. The company, like many traditional automakers, has struggled to keep pace with the rapid rise of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers.Ratings agencies have downgraded Nissan to junk status, with Moody’s citing “weak profitability” and an “ageing model portfolio” as key factors. Shares in the company have plummeted nearly 40% over the past year.Earlier this month, Nissan also scrapped plans for a $1 billion battery plant in southern Japan, citing the difficult “business environment."", as reported news agency AFP.A potential merger with Japanese rival Honda had been viewed as a possible lifeline, but talks collapsed in February after Honda proposed turning Nissan into a subsidiary. Despite that, Chief Operating Officer Ivan Espinosa—who became CEO in March—said the company remains “open to collaborating with multiple partners,” including Honda.Nissan has faced numerous setbacks in recent years, most notably the 2018 arrest of former chairman Carlos Ghosn on financial misconduct charges. Ghosn later escaped Japan in a dramatic and controversial fashion, reportedly hiding in an audio equipment box.Espinosa acknowledged on Tuesday that the automaker faces serious challenges in achieving a turnaround but emphasized its financial stability: “We have enough cash to do so,” he told reporters.",Nissan Motor Corp is slashing about 15% of its global workforce and cutting its number of auto plants from 17 to 10.

China lifts Boeing ban after trade truce with US; jet deliveries set to resume,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-lifts-boeing-ban-after-trade-truce-with-us-jet-deliveries-set-to-resume/articleshow/121131147.cms,"China has lifted a month-long ban on Boeing aircraft deliveries , following trade talks with the United States, according to The Guardian, which cited sources.The decision follows a breakthrough in trade negotiations between the world's two largest economies. As part of the tentative agreement, the US has slashed tariffs on most Chinese imports from a steep 145 per cent to 30 per cent for a 90-day window, while China has lowered its 125 per cent duties on US goods to 10 per cent and suspended several retaliatory measures.Sources said that Chinese authorities have begun informing state-owned airlines and aviation agencies this week that they may now resume deliveries of US-made aircraft. Airlines have been given discretion to arrange the timing and logistics of those deliveries independently.The move offers a much-needed lift to Boeing Co., which has been struggling with multiple headwinds, including safety concerns, production issues, and the fallout from global trade disputes. The resumption of deliveries will not only spare the US aerospace giant the cost and time of finding new buyers for approximately 50 planes destined for Chinese carriers this year, but will also unlock a fresh round of payments once the jets are handed over.China is expected to account for 20 per cent of global aircraft demand over the next 20 years, making it a crucial market for both Boeing and its European rival Airbus. In 2018, about a quarter of Boeing's production went to China, but relations have cooled since then due to trade hostilities and a series of safety and quality issues plaguing the US manufacturer.Boeing's troubles in China began in earnest after the Trump administration's tariff blitz, which triggered retaliatory duties from Beijing. The Chinese government then barred local carriers from accepting new Boeing deliveries, pushing some jets to be returned to the US and prompting Boeing to explore alternative markets like India, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia.Signs of a possible détente first emerged in late April when China expressed its willingness to normalise trade ties with US firms. Beijing offered to temporarily lift duties on certain American products, including medical devices, chemicals, and aviation leases — a gesture seen as a soft opening for further talks.Despite the progress, uncertainties remain. A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment on the development, and the Civil Aviation Administration of China has yet to issue an official statement. The three-month reprieve could prove fleeting if broader trade negotiations fail to yield a long-term resolution.China lifts Boeing ban after trade truce with US; jet deliveries set to resume.","China lifts Boeing ban after trade truce with US; jet deliveries set to resume.

US & China agree to cut tariffs for 90 days in bid to defuse trade war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-china-agree-to-cut-tariffs-for-90-days-in-bid-to-defuse-trade-war/articleshow/121122737.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: The US-China trade deal has increased the headache for Indian negotiators, who are once again headed to Washington DC to discuss the proposed bilateral trade deal.While signalling movement towards a deal between the world's two largest trading nations, the 90-day truce, which will see them slash tariffs by 115 percentage points, opens the door for the flow of goods from China. As a result, some of the interest in Indian products is bound to come down as supply lines will reopen for 90 days, apart from some front-loading of consignments in case the pause is not extended.Explaining that many of the tariffs that he imposed remain in place, Trump said talks would be focused in part on “opening up” China to American businesses. He said he expected to talk to President Xi Jinping later this week, but putting a full deal on paper would take a while.The outcome of the frenzied weekend of negotiations in Switzerland brought tariff rates close to where they were before Trump ratcheted them higher on April 2, which he billed as “Liberation Day”. However, the talks did not appear to yield any meaningful concessions beyond an agreement to continue discussions.“We concluded that we have a shared interest,” said treasury secretary Scott Bessent at a news conference in Geneva where US and Chinese officials met over the weekend.“The consensus from both delegations is that neither side wanted a decoupling,” he said.China said it will suspend or revoke countermeasures adopted in retaliation for escalating tariffs. In early April, the Chinese govt had ordered restrictions on the export of rare earth metals and magnets, critical components used by many industries.The agreement breaks an impasse that had brought much trade between China and US to a halt. Many American businesses had suspended orders, holding out hope the two countries could strike a deal to lower the tariff rates. Economists have warned the disautomakers, aerospace manufacturers and semiconductor firms.Bessent said the two countries may also discuss purchase agreements of American goods by Chinese govt. pute will slow global growth, fuel inflation and create product shortages, potentially tipping US into a recession. “We came with a list of problems we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that,” Bessent said.Global markets jumped on the announcement. The two countries said the ongoing negotiations will involve Bessent; Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative; and He Lifeng, China’s vice-premier for economic policy, who led the talks for the Chinese.Global markets jumped on the announcement. Bessent said the Chinese “understood the magnitude” of the fentanyl crisis in US and that there is a “positive path forward”.Greer said the talks were underscored by “mutual understanding and mutual respect”, but noted China was the only country to retaliate after Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries last month.","The 90-day truce, which will see them slash tariffs by 115 percentage points, opens the door for the flow of goods from China.

'We'll no longer tolerate': Donald Trump signs executive order giving drugmakers 30 days to slash drug prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/well-no-longer-tolerate-donald-trump-signs-executive-order-giving-drugmakers-30-days-to-slash-drug-costs/articleshow/121117011.cms,"President Donald Trump on Monday signed a sweeping executive order aimed at slashing prescription drug prices in the United States, giving pharmaceutical companies a 30-day deadline to cut costs or face action.""Starting today, the United States will no longer subsidise the healthcare of foreign countries... and we’ll no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from Big Pharma,"" Trump told reporters as he signed the executive order at the White House that drug prices should fall by at least 59 percent -- and in some cases as high as 80 or 90 percent.The directive instructs the health department, under Robert F Kennedy Jr.'s leadership, to negotiate new drug prices within a month. Should negotiations fail, Kennedy must create a rule linking US medication prices to lower international rates.Trump further stated, ""We're going to equalize. We're all going to pay the same. We're going to pay what Europe pays.""The impact of the Republican president’s executive order on Americans with private health insurance is still unclear. The government mainly has the power to control drug prices through Medicare and Medicaid programs.The announcement of potential drug price reductions coincided with House Republicans unveiling their proposal to reduce Medicaid funding by $880 billion.The proposed ""Most Favoured Nation"" policy seeks to align US drug prices with the lowest international rates for identical medications. ""Whoever is paying the lowest price, that's the price that we're going to get,"" Trump said.The implementation largely depends on pharmaceutical companies' willingness to negotiate prices and might face legal opposition, similar to Trump's previous attempt during his first administration.Trump criticised the current pricing system, highlighting disparities in costs between the US and Europe, particularly regarding the obesity medication Ozempic.""It was really the countries that forced Big Pharma to do things that, frankly, I'm not sure they really felt comfortable doing, but they've gotten away with it,"" Trump said.He announced plans to investigate nations allegedly pressuring pharmaceutical companies through product restrictions to secure lower prices. He acknowledged challenging ""the most powerful lobby in the world -- the drug and pharmaceutical lobby.""Earlier on Monday, Trump previewed the reduction: ""DRUG PRICES TO BE CUT BY 59%, PLUS! Gasoline, Energy, Groceries, and all other costs, DOWN. NO INFLATION!!!"" he wrote on Truth Social.Trump said that lower prescription drug prices in the US would be offset by higher costs in other countries.This isn’t his first attempt to lower drug prices. During his 2017–2021 term, he proposed similar measures, but they were blocked by strong resistance from the pharmaceutical industry.","President Donald Trump on Monday signed a sweeping executive order aimed at slashing prescription drug prices in the United States.

"Dow jumps nearly 1,000 points, S&P 500 soars 2.6% after 90-day US-China tariff truce sparks market rally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-markets-today-dow-jones-index-sp-nasdaq-us-china-tariff-us-markets-future/articleshow/121113040.cms,"US stocks surged Monday in a powerful rebound after the United States and China agreed to a 90-day truce in their ongoing trade war, easing tensions that had weighed heavily on markets for months. The deal, which includes mutual tariff rollbacks, ignited a broad rally across sectors and asset classes.The S&P 500 climbed 2.6% in early trading, bringing it within 5.5% of its all-time high from February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 957 points, or 2.3%, while the Nasdaq composite surged 3.6%.The rally came after both nations announced substantial reductions in tariffs, a move many analysts labeled the ""best-case scenario"" from the weekend negotiations in Geneva. The US will cut tariffs on Chinese goods from highs of 145% down to 30%, while China will slash its own levies from 125% to 10%. The 90-day window is intended to provide time for deeper trade discussions aimed at resolving long-standing disputes.This development comes on the heels of last week’s US-U.K. agreement, which reduced tariffs on many British imports to 10%, further fuelling investor optimism.Markets responded with enthusiasm beyond just equities.Crude oil prices rose more than 3%, anticipating stronger global demand. The US dollar strengthened against major currencies, and Treasury yields jumped as investors dialed back expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.45% from 4.37%, while the two-year yield jumped to 3.99% from 3.88%.Still, investors remain cautious. The tariff reductions are temporary, and Wall Street has been whipsawed before by sudden reversals in trade policy. The joint statement acknowledged “substantial progress” but also signaled significant work ahead in talks between the world’s two largest economies.Market gains were widespread. Apparel stocks surged due to their exposure to Chinese manufacturing: Lululemon soared 10%, and Nike gained 7.3%. Travel companies also rebounded, with Carnival up 8.9% and Norwegian Cruise Line rising 8%, as investors bet on a consumer spending boost. Retailers like Best Buy and Amazon rose over 7% as easing tariffs could help protect their margins and prices.Global markets mirrored the upbeat tone. European and Asian indexes posted gains, though smaller than those in the US India’s Sensex rallied 3.7% after a separate ceasefire agreement with Pakistan calmed geopolitical tensions in the region. Pakistan’s KSE 100 index skyrocketed over 9%, briefly halting trading, following both the ceasefire and the IMF’s approval of a $1 billion bailout tranche.Monday’s rally reflects investors’ relief—but also underscores how fragile market sentiment remains in the face of policy unpredictability. With only 90 days until the truce expires, eyes will be on Washington and Beijing for signs of lasting resolution.","The S&P 500 climbed 2.6% in early trading, bringing it within 5.5% of its all- time high.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

"Crypto isn’t dead, it’s evolving rapidly to create a new world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-isnt-dead-its-evolving-rapidly-to-create-a-new-world/articleshow/101324954.cms,"Regulatory landscape



There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online. “Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN



NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance.

Stock market recommendations:In recent weeks, the Nifty index has showcased remarkable resilience, maintaining its upward trajectory and investor confidence despite a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Escalating tensions in key global regions, which typically heighten market volatility, have not deterred the index's momentum. Additionally, the recent spike in crude oil prices—a factor that historically weighs heavily on the Indian economy due to its import dependence—has had a surprisingly muted impact on market sentiment. This strength in the face of adversity reflects underlying market optimism, robust domestic fundamentals, and continued participation from both institutional and retail investors.The Nifty has delivered a technically significant breakout, moving above the last 6 weeks’ range 25,200-24,500, closing decisively above the 25,200 marks. In Thursday's session it closed above 25,500 levels, its highest closing level in over eight months. This move not only reinforces the prevailing bullish momentum but also validates the sustained higher high–higher low-price structure, a classic hallmark of a well-established uptrend.Importantly, the positive market breadth—reflected in broad-based participation across sectors—adds conviction to the ongoing rally.Given this strength, we are revising our near-term upside target for the index to the 25,700–25,900 zone. This revised projection aligns with the measured move objective derived from the recent consolidation range between 24,500 and 25,200. The breakout from this congestion zone suggests a continuation pattern, and with technical indicators supporting the trend, we anticipate these levels to be achieved over the coming weeks.We are upwardly revising the immediate support base for the Nifty to the 24,800–25,000 zone. This zone now emerges as a critical demand area, as it coincides with the current week’s swing low and the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), thereby forming a strong confluence support region.Sustained price action above this zone will reinforce the bullish bias and provide a launchpad for further upside. This area is expected to act as a key pivot in the near term, where any potential pullbacks could find buying interest. A hold above this support band will be instrumental in maintaining the current trend structure and confirming the strength of the ongoing breakout.Bank Nifty staged a strong uptrend last week, culminating in a fresh all-time high during Thursday’s session, driven in part by improved global risk sentiment following reports of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This breakout underscores the index's robust bullish undertone, further validated by its sustained position above the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) since April—a key indicator of persistent upward momentum.From a structural standpoint, the index continues to exhibit a classic higher-high, higher-low formation, reflecting a well-established uptrend. The breadth of the rally remains healthy, with participation expanding across key banking constituents, thereby reinforcing the directional strength. Notably, Bank Nifty is displaying characteristics of trend elongation, where extended rallies are followed by shallow and orderly retracements—a technical sign of a strong and maturing trend.Given the recent breakout from the consolidation zone of 56,000–53,500, the implied pattern target projects an upside potential towards the 58,500 mark over the coming weeks. This projection is further supported by bullish price structure and momentum indicators.On the downside, the key support base has been recalibrated to the 55,000–55,500 region, which marks a confluence of technical factors—namely, the 50-day EMA and the recent swing lows of the past three weeks. This zone is likely to act as a strong accumulation area, and any corrective pullbacks into this region should be viewed as incremental buying opportunities within the broader uptrend.The stock has generated a breakout above the falling channel containing last 1 month’s corrective decline signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock is currently seen rebounding after a base formation around the 50 days EMA signaling overall positive bias.The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias. We expect the stock to head higher towards 176 levels in the coming months being the 80% retracement of the entire previous decline (184-123).The stock has recently generated a breakout above a bullish cup and handle formation and is seen sustaining above the short- and medium-term moving averages thus supporting the positive bias.The breakout is supported by strong volume and the base of recent consolidation is placed at the 200 days EMA which supports the positive bias.The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal above its nine periods average signaling positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 319 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the entire decline (395-201).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Tata Steel, and Lloyds Engineering Works are the top stock picks for today.

Gold has been dipping after a recent surge amidst tensions in the Middle East. With the US declaring a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, the safe haven demand for gold has somewhat gone down. What’s the outlook for gold and silver prices in the near future and what gold and silver rate levels should investors look at? Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group shares his views:Gold is currently holding a crucial support level around ₹95,800. This zone is significant, as a strong reversal from here could potentially trigger a recovery in prices, targeting the ₹98,500 mark. This level also coincides with a previously unfilled gap, making it a key technical target for traders watching for a bounce.Despite a recent 4% correction in gold prices, the broader trend remains positive. The pullback is being viewed as a healthy retracement within a larger bullish structure, and market sentiment continues to favor the upside, especially amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and global demand for safe-haven assets.A sustained move above ₹98,500 would be a strong bullish signal, clearing the way for a possible retest of the psychological ₹100,000 mark. Momentum traders may closely watch for confirmation above this resistance level to enter fresh long positions. On the downside, if ₹95,800 fails to hold, it could invite further selling pressure, but for now, the support remains intact. Overall, the bias remains positive, with technical indicators pointing to a potential recovery, provided key levels are respected. Investors are advised to stay alert for price action cues around the ₹95,800–₹98,500 range.MCX Silver has recently witnessed a sharp decline of around 5% from its recent highs, triggering short-term concerns among traders. However, despite this pullback, the broader trend for silver remains firmly positive. The recent correction appears to be a temporary pause within an ongoing bullish trajectory, rather than a reversal of the larger trend.The ₹102,500 level is emerging as a crucial support zone, and price action near this area will be key in determining the next move. This level has historically provided a base for reversals, and a strong bounce from here could reignite bullish momentum. Technical indicators suggest that as long as this support holds, the upside potential remains intact.On the higher side, silver prices have the potential to reclaim the ₹109,000 level, which represents a significant resistance zone and a near-term target for buyers. A sustained move above this resistance could pave the way for further gains in the medium term.Overall, while short-term volatility may persist, the underlying strength in silver remains. Traders and investors should closely monitor the ₹102,500 support for signs of reversal, as it could offer a favorable risk-reward entry point for the next leg higher.","Gold has been dipping after a recent surge amidst tensions in the Middle East.

Tesla shake-up: Who is Omead Afshar? Senior executive reportedly fired by Elon Musk amid slumping sales in key markets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-shake-up-who-is-omead-afshar-senior-executive-fired-by-elon-musk-amid-slumping-sales-in-key-markets/articleshow/122103380.cms,"File photo: Omead Afshar (left) and Elon Musk (Picture credit: X, ANI)

Who is Omead Afshar?

Omead Afshar, one of Elon Musk ’s closest aides and Tesla’s vice president of manufacturing and operations, has been reportedlyfired by Musk as the electric vehicle maker grapples with declining sales across North America and Europe.According to CNBC, Afshar’s termination comes just days before the end of the second quarter, amid ongoing pressure from investors following Tesla’s fifth consecutive monthly sales drop in Europe and a 15% decline in deliveries in China.Afshar’s dismissal marks the latest high-profile exit from Tesla following the recent departure of Milan Kovac, head of the company’s Optimus humanoid robotics program.Afshar had been leading a critical team overseeing Tesla’s business across major markets, including executives in sales and policy.His ouster comes at a time when Tesla’s brand has also taken a reputational hit, partly due to Musk’s controversial political positions and the underperformance of the Cybertruck. Analysts are forecasting a global drop of at least 10% in Tesla’s Q2 deliveries. The stock is down 19% this year.Often described as “Musk’s fixer,” Afshar was one of the most powerful and trusted executives within Elon Musk’s business empire.According to Forbes, he began his journey with Tesla as an engineer in 2011 and rose through the ranks to eventually become vice president, overseeing operations in North America and Europe.An American citizen born to Iranian parents, Afshar studied biomedical engineering with a focus on mechanical engineering at the University of California, Irvine.Known for his perfectionism and operational discipline, Afshar gained Musk’s trust early on and became involved in some of Tesla’s most high-stakes projects.He played a key role in building Tesla’s massive Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, a project that solidified his reputation for delivering under pressure.In 2022, he was the subject of an internal probe over the acquisition of rare construction materials, including speciality glass, for a secretive Musk-led initiative, as reported by Bloomberg.Following that investigation, he worked briefly at SpaceX, where he was later promoted to vice president before returning to Tesla.Afshar also had a hand in Musk’s 2022 acquisition of Twitter, now known as X. According to ET, he helped implement cost-cutting measures during the platform’s restructuring.Despite his abrupt firing, Afshar continued praising Musk on social media in recent days, calling the robotaxi pilot launch in Austin “absolutely historic” and thanking the CEO “for pushing us all.”His influence was such that The Wall Street Journal once described him as one of the few insiders who could both understand and execute Musk’s most ambitious visions.","Omead Afshar, Tesla's vice president of manufacturing and operations, has been reportedly fired by Elon Musk.

Torrent Pharma revives talks to buy KKR stake in JB Chem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/torrent-pharma-revives-talks-to-buy-kkr-stake-in-jb-chem/articleshow/122122732.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ahmedabad-based Torrent Pharma has revived talks with PE major KKR to buy its stake in Mumbai-based JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals in a deal which could cost around Rs 20,000 crore.KKR's nearly 48% stake in JB Chem is valued approximately Rs 13,400 crore at its stock's closing price of Rs 1,803 per share on BSE on Friday. The transaction, which will trigger an open offer by Torrent for up to 26% of the company's stake held by public shareholders, is expected to be finalised soon, sources said.Discussions between KKR and other bidders, including Torrent and Micro Labs, ended last year due to valuation concerns. Efforts to reach Torrent Pharma and JB Chem were futile, and KKR officials were not available for comments.The US private equity major has been seeking to exit its investment in JB Chem for some time, and sources indicated this time the deal with Torrent Pharma is likely to proceed. Typically, private equity firms aim to exit investments within three-to-four years. In March, KKR divested about 7% stake through block deals.In July 2020, the PE major had acquired 54% in JB Chem from the promoters, the Mody family, for approximately Rs 3,100 crore or Rs 745 per share.Post acquisition, the company scaled up its domestic formulations business with a strong growth in cardiac, ophthalmology and anti-parasitic therapies. Over the years, the company ramped up its domestic play and improved its revenue from segments that offer sustainable growth and margins. Using organic and inorganic routes, it launched new products that have helped plug gaps in the business. For 2024-25, JB Pharma recorded a revenue of Rs 3,918 crore, registering 12% growth.

"Before the clock runs out: India, US race to seal trade deal before Donald Trump’s tariffs kick in; top things to expect",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/before-the-clock-runs-out-india-us-race-to-seal-trade-deal-before-donald-trumps-tariffs-kick-in-top-things-to-expect/articleshow/122112327.cms,"India-US trade deal: Currently, India's main trade representative is conducting negotiations in Washington. (AI image)

India-US Trade Deal: What To Expect

The final result could be a reduced-scope trade arrangement, structured similarly to the US-UK compact finalised in May, GTRI said according to an ANI report.

This framework would require India to lower Most Favoured Nation (MFN) duties on various industrial products, including automobiles, which has been a persistent request from Washington, GTRI said.

Regarding agricultural commerce, India might grant restricted entry for American products including ethanol, almonds, apples, avocados, wine, and spirits through modest duty reductions and tariff-rate quotas, the GTRI report said.

India aims to safeguard crucial sectors including dairy, rice and wheat sectors, considering their vital role in rural sustenance and food security for its population.

The agreement could include strategic arrangements involving substantial procurement of American oil, LNG, commercial aircraft and nuclear power equipment.

The negotiations might require India to relax regulations concerning multi-brand retail and remanufactured goods importation, potentially creating opportunities for international retail corporations, the report said.

As a concession, the United States would likely maintain a 10% baseline tariff on most Indian exports, rather than implementing the previously announced 26% increase, GTRI said.

Nevertheless, the US position on maintaining its existing MFN tariffs on Indian goods raises questions about equitable treatment and mutual benefits.

India-US Trade Deal Hurdles:

India-US trade deal: The United States and India appear to be in the final stages of discussions to finalise the first-cut of the US-Indian trade deal. With US President Donald Trump’s July deadline looming, the trade deal could determine the trajectory of their economic relationship, according to the Global Trade and Research Initiative (GTRI).Currently, India's main trade representative is conducting negotiations in Washington, whilst both nations strive to achieve a limited arrangement -- commonly known as a ""mini-deal"" -- before the deadline expires.The timeframe corresponds to President Trump's 90-day suspension of nation-specific tariffs, declared on April 2. Should negotiations fail to conclude by July 8, India might encounter renewed tariff pressures, although analysts suggest substantial duties are improbable.Also Read | ‘Like H-1B without a lottery’: What is O-1 visa? New route to US becomes popular among Indians; check details The negotiations could potentially break down if the United States persists in demanding extensive access to India's fundamental agricultural sector or continues to advocate for GMO product allowances.India has explicitly declared that these requirements pose risks to food security and impact the sustenance of more than 700 million individuals within the nation's agricultural economy.Although agricultural products constitute a minor share of American exports to India, the US administration continues to press strongly for enhanced market accessibility.Experts in India are concerned that any concessions might pave the way for subsequent requests that could undermine the country's established public procurement framework and the minimum support price (MSP) mechanism, which are vital components of its agricultural policies.Also Read | China plays hardball! After choking rare earth magnets supply, China blocks important agriculture-related shipments to India; continues exports to others Should the discussions fail to progress, there remains uncertainty about whether President Trump would reinstate the previous 26% duties. Trade specialists consider this scenario unlikely, noting that India was not a primary target in the initial tariff directive. Nevertheless, considering Trump's unconventional policy decisions, all possibilities remain open.Irrespective of how negotiations conclude, trade authorities advise that India should maintain its position and advocate for an agreement based on mutual benefit, equilibrium and clarity.GTRI emphasises ""Any trade deal with the US must not be politically driven or one-sided; it must protect our farmers, our digital ecosystem, and our sovereign regulatory space.""Today, President Donald Trump indicated that a significant trade agreement with India is on the horizon.""We're not going to make deals with everybody. Some we are just going to send them a letter, say thank you very much. You are to pay 25, 35, 45 per cent. That's the easy way to do it, and my people don't want to do it that way. They want to do some of it, but they want to make more deals than I would do,"" he said.""""But we're having some great deals. We have one coming up, maybe with India. Very big one. Where we're going to open up India, in the China deal, we're starting to open up China. Things that never really could have happened, and the relationship with every country has been very good"" he added.","The United States and India appear to be in the final stages of discussions to finalise the first-cut of the US-Indian trade deal.

While reviewing the performance of state-run banks, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman asked banks to prioritise deposit mobilisation to support credit growth and pushed them to undertake special drives and leverage their massive branch network to raise resources.During bank-wise presentations, the financial services secretary asked the lenders to make use of the clean books to lend, especially to small businesses. The finance minister flagged the energy sector, especially renewables, as a focus and asked banks to develop a credit model to support small modular nuclear reactors. ""Deepening corporate lending in productive sectors was also emphasised, with a strong focus on maintaining robust underwriting and risk management standards,"" an official statement said.The finance minister also suggested that banks should ""proactively identify"" emerging commercial growth areas for the next decade, which can aid profitability and growth. The other important message was on improving customer experience, including in branches and simple online and offline platforms. Sitharaman focused on expanding the branch presence, especially expansion in metro and urban centres.The comments come at a time when private lenders have stepped up efforts in urban centres, which are seen to be more profitable.This will mean public sector players will have to double down on effort on this front, while balancing rural and semi-urban focus. In fact, Sitharaman also asked banks to focus on manpower requirements - including existing and arising vacancies - as branches are often not adequately staffed following expansion initiatives. Several banks have already started initiatives on improving customer service and improving the overall branch experience.Banks have been instructed to scale up efforts on financial inclusion schemes and expand their presence in GIFT City.

Solar players make a fast buck by blocking plug points to the grid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/solar-players-make-a-fast-buck-by-blocking-plug-points-to-the-grid/articleshow/122117787.cms,"AI generated image

NEW DELHI: A grey market for grid interconnect facilities has emerged in the solar sector as installation of projects outpace expansion of grid interconnect and transmission infrastructure. Smaller players are exploiting this mismatch by booking interconnect capacity for reselling at a hefty premium of Rs 40 lakh per MW (megawatt).Industry executives said these players book the grid interconnect, or ISTS (interstate transmission system) capacity, the moment bookings open. But they have little or no intention of setting up solar projects. Some of them hold on to the capacity by installing only a small part of the promised project.For example, 80% of the 40 GW interconnect capacity expected to be commissioned next year has already been booked. The executives suspect that a majority of the 8.8 GW (gigawatts) capacity in the Fatehgarh and Bikaner interconnect corridors in Rajasthan, the largest hubs in India, have been booked by such players.The situation has led to the underutilisation of the existing green corridors, while serious developers get stranded with their projects since they are unable to tie up consumers in the absence of a grid interconnect or wheeling capacity.“Securing interconnect capacity from the grey market can affect project viability because of the substantial additional costs,” means taking a huge financial hit, which can affect the viability of projects,” one executive said. Interconnect capacity bought from the grey market for a 1,000 MW project can entail an additional expenditure of Rs 400 crore or so, he said.Interconnect capacity is currently allotted under three modes: LoA (letter of award of a project), land availability, and/or BGs (bank guarantees). Allottees are allowed to convert to another at a later stage. It is mostly the land- and bank guarantee-based allotments that being misused by developers.Nine developers were some time back served notices for revocation, which is likely to be appealed at the regulatory level. Some have invoked ‘force-majeure’ clause to delay the revocation.",Smaller players are exploiting this mismatch by booking interconnect capacity for reselling at a hefty premium.

Rise of Zohran Mamdani

Wall Street worried

The possible victory of Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, in the upcoming New York mayoral polls has people on Wall Street worried.In Manhattan's financial district, pessimistic predictions are circulating. According to Wall Street recruitment specialist Michael Nelson, his clientele, typically earning above $1 million annually, express serious concerns.""This will be the end of New York City as we know it"" reflects the sentiment amongst his affluent clients regarding Mamdani's potential November victory, he told Bloomberg.The impact is already visible in New York City property-related stocks. Flagstar Financial Inc., which provides loans to apartment complexes, experienced up to 6.7% decline on Wednesday. Property companies Empire State Realty Trust, SL Green Realty and Vornado Realty Trust also registered losses.Even critics acknowledge that Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist, has garnered significant public support.""It's officially hot commie summer,"" wrote hedge fund billionaire Dan Loeb on X, following Mamdani's unexpected victory over Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary for the New York City mayoral position.Also Read | Days of South Asians being ignored and erased in New York politics are gone, says Zohran Kwame Mamdani The statement reflects the genuine concern amongst the city's wealthy circles that a Mamdani victory in the November general election would result in increased taxation, potentially causing affluent residents to leave the five boroughs.An important detail is that Mamdani’s tax proposals would require approval from New York State Governor Kathy Hochul, who has expressed opposition. Additionally, Mamdani's plan to raise $70 billion in debt faces significant obstacles.According to Kathy Wylde, a prominent New York intermediary who has facilitated connections between business leaders from finance, real estate and media with city officials for years, whilst Mamdani appeals to the youth, his ideological stance causes significant concern among taxpayers and employers.However, Mamdani successfully gained support from voters across diverse socioeconomic and racial communities.In his Wednesday morning address, he emphasised that ""a life of dignity should not be reserved for a fortunate few.""The foundation of his success lay in a strategic social media campaign that combined populist economic policies and progressive cultural messaging through viral-worthy video content.On Tuesday, he featured in an Instagram video alongside Emily Ratajkowski, who commands over 29 million followers. The model and actress sported a ""Hot Girls for Zohran"" t-shirt whilst encouraging voter turnout.This exemplified the clever strategy that enabled Mamdani to build a substantial volunteer base numbering in tens of thousands. These supporters diligently canvassed neighbourhoods, maintained street presence and utilised social media to reach voters. They promoted his policy agenda: Free childcare, state-operated grocery shops with reduced prices, complimentary bus transport, rent controls and additional measures - largely funded through increased taxation of wealthy individuals.New York's establishment elite supported Cuomo, a 67-year-old Democratic veteran who positioned himself as an experienced centrist capable of addressing the city's challenges, from underground transit safety to the widely recognised cost-of-living issues.His campaign received substantial financial backing from prominent figures, including Michael R. Bloomberg, founder and primary owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, along with Bill Ackman, Loeb and Vornado's Steven Roth. His political action committee, Fix the City, accumulated an unprecedented primary campaign fund of nearly $25 million.However, the campaign's advertising strategy predominantly focused on criticising Mamdani rather than highlighting Cuomo's administrative plans. Despite resigning as New York governor following sexual harassment claims, which he contests, Cuomo maintained strong establishment support, including an endorsement from former President Bill Clinton.In contrast, Mamdani received endorsements from progressive leaders, including Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders.Some financial sector representatives appear to be considering a more accepting stance towards the democratic socialist candidate.""While we might disagree on certain issues, we should always be hopeful that Mamdani — if he ends up being elected mayor — can unite the city to address its critical education, public safety, housing and economic development needs,"" said Ralph Schlosstein, former head of Evercore Inc. and a longtime Democrat, according to the Bloomberg report.According to Rich Farley, an experienced Wall Street legal expert, numerous affluent residents view the November general election as crucial. A Mamdani victory could prompt wealthy individuals to seriously consider relocating from the city.Before this contest, high-net-worth donors must determine their stance towards Mamdani. Cuomo, potentially running as an independent, needs to convince supporters of his viability outside the Democratic primary framework.Should he continue his campaign, he will face Republican Curtis Sliwa and incumbent Eric Adams, who is running independently after avoiding the primary following corruption allegations.Some Wall Street professionals are contemplating more decisive actions.""I've already talked to hedge fund guys who have told me they have got a foot out the door,"" said Eric Rosen, who previously held senior positions at JPMorgan and in hedge fund management.""I left New York City 8 years ago because I didn't like the way the city was being run,"" he said. ""I sold my Park Ave. co-op and its now down 25% and my house in Florida is up 250%.

In the past 24 hours, Trump has dramatically suspended trade talks with Canada over its digital services tax, vaguely confirmed a fresh agreement with China, and teased a “very big” breakthrough soon with India. Central to this flurry of announcements is his revived strategy of issuing reciprocal tariffs—by letter—to nations wishing to access the US market.Trump’s decision to halt negotiations with Canada came after Ottawa unveiled a 3 per cent levy on major US tech firms, which he denounced as “a direct and blatant attack on our country.” He declared via social media that he would determine and impose appropriate tariffs within a week, citing the US’s dominant position in the relationship. Meanwhile, officials in Washington emphasise that Canada holds more to lose, reinforcing Trump’s image of maximum leverage.But Trump also struck a softer tone on India, calling a potential trade deal “very big.” He hinted this could result in sweeping access for US businesses, dismantling barriers that have thus far kept them at bay: “Right now, it’s restricted.You can’t walk in there… we agree that going to India and trade…” He added that the China deal was already underway, giving US firms a shot at rare earths and other vital commodities, though details remain under wraps.President Donald Trump’s trade agenda took a dramatic turn over the past 24 hours, as he announced a series of sweeping moves on tariffs, suspended trade talks with Canada, signalled a breakthrough with China, and hinted at a “very big” deal with India. The moves mark a sharp escalation in his second-term strategy to assert US dominance over global trade, even as allies and rivals alike push back.Trump stunned officials on both sides of the border by immediately halting trade negotiations with Canada.“Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately,” Trump posted on his social media network. “We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period.”Canada’s new digital services tax, due to take effect Monday, imposes a 3% levy on tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta and Airbnb — applying retroactively and totalling nearly $2 billion in US company obligations.Read more: Donald Trump calls off trade talks with Canada, slams digital services tax Speaking from the White House, Trump reinforced his hardline stance. “They did something with our tech companies today trying to copy Europe. It’s not going to work out well for Europe either. And it’s not going to work out well for Canada. They were foolish to do it,” he said.When asked if Canada could reverse his decision, Trump responded, “No… It doesn’t matter to me. We have all the cards.”The broader context is Trump’s push to impose reciprocal tariffs — some as high as 50% — on countries with whom the US runs a trade deficit. The 90-day negotiation window, set to expire on July 9, could usher in a new wave of tariffs.“We have 200 countries, you could say 200 countries plus. You can’t do that,” Trump said. “So at a certain point over the next week and a half or so, or maybe before we’re going to send out a letter.”Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney sought to downplay tensions, saying, “We will continue to conduct these complex negotiations in the best interests of Canadians. It’s a negotiation.”But Trump appears unmoved, accusing Canada of levying “very, very severe” taxes on American companies, including tariffs of up to 400% on dairy products.The Canadian tax mirrors EU regulations and specifically targets companies with significant online revenues generated from Canadian users. Trump blasted the policy as “a direct and blatant attack on our country.”Matt Schruers, head of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, praised Trump’s swift response: “We appreciate the Administration’s decisive response to Canada’s discriminatory tax on US digital exports.”At a White House press conference, Trump confirmed that the US is preparing to send letters to several countries within the next 10 days.“We’re just going to tell them what they have to pay to do business in the United States,” he said. “We can do whatever we want. We could extend it. We could make it shorter. I’d like to just send letters out to everybody: Congratulations, you’re paying 25 per cent.”Turning to India, Trump expressed optimism that a long-pending deal may soon materialise.“India, I think we are going to reach a deal where we have the right to go and do trade,” Trump told reporters. “Right now, it’s restricted. You can’t walk in there, you can’t even think about it. We are looking to get a full trade barrier dropping, which is unthinkable and I am not sure that that is going to happen. But as of this moment, we agree that going to India and trade…”In remarks during the “Big Beautiful Bill” event, Trump said: “We have one coming up, maybe with India. Very big one. Where we’re going to open up India, in the China deal, we’re starting to open up China.”Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed that sentiment, saying: “You should expect a deal between the United States and India in the not-too-distant future because I think we found a place that really works for both countries.”Commerce minister Piyush Goyal confirmed talks were ongoing, stressing that the goal was a “fair, equitable and balanced agreement.”Trump also confirmed that a deal had been signed with China “the other day,” though details remain limited. China’s Commerce Ministry acknowledged the agreement, mentioning a review of rare earth exports, but offered no timeline.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said China had agreed to make it easier for American firms to acquire key minerals. “What we’re seeing here is a de-escalation under President Trump’s leadership,” he told Fox Business.","US President Donald Trump has swiftly reset his global focus, zeroing in on trade, tariffs and new deals.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 510 points, or 1.2%, as broad-based gains lifted nearly every sector in the S&P 500.The rally marks a sharp turnaround from earlier this year, when the S&P 500 fell nearly 20% on fears that President Donald Trump’s trade policies would derail the economy. As of 12:13 p.m. Eastern, the S&P 500 was up 0.7% and the Nasdaq 0.6%, AP reported.Nike led market gains with an 18.5% jump, despite warning of a $1 billion tariff impact and announcing “surgical” price hikes in the US starting this fall. Other consumer and industrial stocks also advanced, buoyed by easing tensions in the Middle East and signs of progress in US-China trade talks.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday that a new trade deal will ease access to rare earth materials critical for manufacturing. China's Commerce Ministry also said both sides had ""confirmed the details of the framework"" for talks, though it did not specifically mention rare earths access.Meanwhile, a ceasefire between Israel and Iran remained in effect, helping stabilise oil prices. US crude held flat, retreating to pre-conflict levels.Inflation continues to shadow market optimism. On Friday, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge—the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index—rose to 2.3% in May, up from 2.1% in April and still above the central bank’s 2% target. Analysts warn that more pronounced inflationary effects from tariffs could emerge in the coming months.""While we also would have expected to already be seeing a bit more pass through into the inflation statistics, we still expect these impacts to show up in a more meaningful way in the next few months,"" said Greg Wilensky, head of US fixed income at Janus Henderson, quoted AP.The Fed has not cut rates in 2025 so far, maintaining caution amid lingering concerns that tariffs could reignite price pressures. Economists still anticipate two cuts before year-end.Bond yields were little changed, with the 10-year Treasury yield ticking up to 4.25% and the two-year note at 3.73%.Stocks in Europe were mostly higher, with investors tracking the US rally and global trade developments.

"Industrial profits dip again: China sees sharp fall in May; Donald Trump's tariffs, price wars add pressure",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/industrial-profits-dip-again-china-sees-sharp-fall-in-may-donald-trump-tariffs-price-wars-add-pressure/articleshow/122108671.cms,"AI-generated representative image

Industrial profits in China fell sharply in May, reversing a brief recovery and highlighting growing challenges in the world’s second-largest economy. The decline reflects a slowdown in factory activity, mounting deflationary pressures, and persistent instability in trade relations with the United States.According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday, quoted by Reuters, industrial profits dropped 9.1 per cent year-on-year in May, ending two consecutive months of growth. The slide comes amid weak domestic demand and continued stress in the property sector.NBS statistician Yu Weining attributed the contraction to ""insufficient effective demand, declining prices of industrial products and fluctuations in short-term factors.""In the first five months of 2025, industrial profits fell 1.1 per cent from a year earlier, following a 1.4 per cent rise recorded in the January-April period. The downturn coincides with the steepest factory-gate deflation China has experienced in nearly two years, as well as continued declines in consumer prices.Despite isolated signs of resilience, such as an unexpected uptick in retail sales in April, economists suggest more policy support is needed to strengthen what remains a fragile recovery.ANZ senior China strategist Xing Zhaopeng noted that commodity tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump have affected prices, while fierce domestic price competition has compressed manufacturers’ margins.The automotive sector, in particular, has come under strain. Sustained high US tariffs and aggressive pricing strategies have led Chinese authorities to intervene, urging manufacturers to halt price wars. Automotive dealers have complained about excessive inventory pressure, stating that manufacturers are oversupplying dealerships, which is eroding profitability and forcing some outlets to shut down.Feng Jianlin, chief economist at Beijing FOST Economic Consulting, said, ""The impact of overcapacity and falling prices on enterprises is still emerging, and efforts need to be made to adjust supply and stabilise demand.""A sectoral breakdown of the data revealed that state-owned enterprises saw profits decline by 7.4 per cent in the January-May period, while private sector firms posted a slight increase of 0.3 per cent. Foreign enterprises registered profit growth of 3.4 per cent.","Industrial profits in China fell sharply in May, reversing a brief recovery.

Crude oil price to slump? Prices set for biggest weekly drop since March 2023; supply risk premium from Israel-Iran conflict fades,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/crude-oil-price-to-slump-prices-set-for-biggest-weekly-drop-since-march-2023-supply-risk-premium-from-israel-iran-conflict-fades/articleshow/122107033.cms,"AI-generated image

Oil prices were on track for their biggest weekly decline since March 2023, as fears of supply disruptions from the Iran-Israel conflict faded, erasing any risk-driven premiums.As of 0637 GMT on Friday, Brent crude futures were up 36 cents, or 0.53 per cent, at $68.09 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 33 cents, or 0.51 per cent, to $65.57. Despite the modest intraday gains, both benchmarks were poised for a weekly drop of around 12 per cent, according to Reuters.Prices have now fallen back to levels seen before the escalation began on June 13, when Israel launched missiles at Iranian military and nuclear facilities. At the start of the week, prices had surged to a five-month high following US strikes on Iranian nuclear installations. However, markets reversed course after US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, leading to a steep drop on Tuesday.Analysts noted the lack of a meaningful disruption to oil flows from the geopolitical tensions. ""Absent the threat of significant supply disruption, we still view oil as fundamentally oversupplied, with our 2025 balances indicating a roughly 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) surplus,"" Macquarie analysts said in a research note quoted by Reuters.The firm revised its WTI price forecast upward by $2, now expecting an average of $67 per barrel in 2025 and $60 in 2026, factoring in lingering geopolitical risks.Some support for prices emerged from US government data, which showed a decline in crude and fuel stockpiles last week, alongside a rise in refining activity and demand. ""The market is starting to digest the fact that crude oil inventories are very tight all of a sudden,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at the Price Futures Group.Additional bullish sentiment followed a Wall Street Journal report suggesting that President Trump is considering an early nomination for the next Federal Reserve chair. The move has revived expectations of potential interest rate cuts in the US, which could bolster oil demand.","Brent crude futures were up 36 cents, or 0.53 per cent, at $68.09 per barrel.

US-China Trade Deal

US-China trade deal: Soon after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal, China has also confirmed that details have been finalized. China also said that United States will 'cancel a series of restrictive measures'.Earlier in the day, Trump said that the United States and China have reached a trade agreement. He also indicated an anticipated deal with India.According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's interview with Bloomberg TV, the agreement was finalized earlier this week, though specific details were not disclosed.""We just signed with China the other day,"" Trump said. Lutnick confirmed the agreement was ""signed and sealed"" two days prior.This development follows initial discussions in Geneva in early May, where both nations agreed to delay substantial tariff increases that threatened bilateral trade. Subsequent talks in London established a negotiation framework, with Trump's mentioned deal appearing to formalise these arrangements.Also Read | 'Very big one': Donald Trump hints India, US on cusp of 'great' trade deal; 10 things to know ""The president likes to close these deals himself. He's the dealmaker. We're going to have deal after deal,"" Lutnick said, according to an AP report.China disclosed earlier this week an acceleration in rare earth export approvals, crucial materials for high-technology products including electric vehicles. Beijing's export restrictions on rare earths have been a significant point of dispute.The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced Thursday that Beijing was expediting the review process for rare earth export licence applications and had approved several applications that met requirements.Export restrictions on minerals overshadowed tariffs during recent trade talks between Beijing and Washington, following China's implementation of licensing requirements for seven rare earth elements in April. This action potentially threatened to affect production of vehicles, robotics, wind turbines and advanced technological items in the United States and globally.The Geneva accord reached in May required both nations to reduce retaliatory tariff increases implemented during Trump's trade war escalation. However, certain elevated tariffs persist, including Washington's duties related to fentanyl trade and those on aluminium and steel.Also Read | Indian team in US for fresh talks on trade deal These dynamic policy changes are negatively impacting both leading global economies.The US economy declined at a 0.5 per cent annual rate from January through March, partially due to increased imports as businesses and consumers acquired foreign products before Trump's potential tariff implementation.Chinese manufacturing profits decreased by more than 9 per cent year-over-year in May, with automotive manufacturers experiencing significant losses. The January-May period showed a decline exceeding 1 per cent compared to the previous year.Trump and US officials expressed optimism about securing trade agreements with numerous countries, including India.""We're going to have deal after deal after deal,"" Lutnick said.","US President Donald Trump said that the United States and China have reached a trade agreement.

Chinese tech giant Xiaomi stunned the electric vehicle (EV) market on Thursday night after it received an overwhelming response to the launch of its new electric SUV, the YU7, clocking 289,000 pre-orders within the first hour of sales.The flood of demand sent the company’s Hong Kong-listed shares soaring to a record high, reinforcing Xiaomi's rapid rise in China's competitive EV sector.According to news agency AFP, Xiaomi founder and CEO Lei Jun expressed astonishment at the unprecedented customer interest. “My goodness, in just two minutes, we received 196,000 paid pre-orders and 128,000 lock-in orders,” Lei said in a video following the launch.“We may be witnessing a miracle in China's automotive industry.”The YU7, a five-seater electric SUV, starts at 253,500 yuan (around $35,360), pricing it nearly 4% below Tesla’s Model Y in China. The sharp price point and Xiaomi’s aggressive feature set appear to have fueled the rapid pre-sale demand.The vehicle boasts a range of up to 760 kilometres on a single charge, significantly above the 719 kilometres advertised for Tesla’s extended-range Model Y.Reuters reported that the YU7's early orders surpassed market expectations of 100,000 and were more than triple the initial response to Xiaomi’s debut sedan, the SU7, launched last year. Analysts at Jefferies noted that while the YU7 is “slightly below” Tesla’s Model Y in price, it “offers much better specs and performance.”Citi analysts, as cited by Reuters, warned that Tesla may need to offer more incentives or even cut prices to keep pace with Xiaomi’s momentum.The YU7 also includes high-end tech features like Apple CarPlay, Apple Music support, and AI-enhanced driver-assist capabilities powered by Nvidia’s Thor chip. Despite being behind Tesla in full self-driving technology, Lei Jun claimed the YU7 beats the Model Y “on a range of metrics.”As per CNBC, the launch was originally planned for July but was moved up, possibly to capitalise on strong market momentum and an intensifying EV price war in China. The vehicle will begin deliveries within one to five weeks.Beyond cars, Xiaomi also launched AI-enabled smart glasses that can take photos, scan QR codes for payments, and perform real-time translations, positioning the brand against Meta’s Ray-Ban smart offerings. Priced at 1,999 yuan ($279), the glasses are currently available only in China.The launch comes at a critical time for China’s economy. Premier Li Qiang, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin this week, highlighted EVs as a cornerstone of Beijing’s push to become a “major consumption powerhouse.” The Xiaomi launch aligns with that strategy, helping drive demand for high-value, tech-forward products.Following the overwhelming reception, Xiaomi’s stock jumped 8% in early trade before paring gains to end 3% higher.According to Reuters, its market capitalisation has now surpassed $200 billion, making it the best-performing large-cap stock in the Asia-Pacific region this year.","Xiaomi's new electric SUV, the YU7, received 289,000 pre-orders within the first hour of sales.

Asian equities surged to multi-year highs on Friday, mirroring Wall Street’s optimism, as easing geopolitical concerns and expectations of interest rate cuts lifted investor sentiment across the region.Meanwhile, oil prices posted modest gains but remained on track for a significant weekly decline amid easing Middle East supply risks and growing optimism over US-Iran diplomacy.According to news agency Reuters, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched its highest level since November 2021 and was last up 0.2%, set to end the week nearly 3% higher.Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5%, crossing the 40,000 mark for the first time in five months, supported by improved sentiment and robust earnings.The rally was buoyed by several positive developments, including a breakthrough between Washington and Beijing on rare earth shipments and news that the US may scrap a controversial tax proposal, a move that had earlier worried foreign investors.Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ, was quoted by Reuters as saying that the reversal ""allays one of the concerns from foreign investors.""European markets also reflected the upbeat tone, with futures on the EUROSTOXX 50 and Germany’s DAX up 0.6%, while FTSE futures climbed 0.16%.The optimism comes amid growing speculation that the US Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates soon.As per Bloomberg, a sharp drop in the US dollar has helped lift Asian currencies and fuel demand for regional assets. The Bloomberg Dollar Index is set for its sixth consecutive monthly decline, its worst losing streak since 2017.With Trump reportedly considering a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell by October, concerns about the Fed’s independence have further weakened the greenback.Investor appetite in Asia has also been driven by blockbuster fundraising activity, with IPO volumes across Hong Kong and Tokyo rising sharply. Regional companies have raised over $90 billion through share sales this year, a 25% increase from the same period in 2024.In commodities, oil prices rose slightly on Friday but remained poised for their steepest weekly decline in over a year. Brent crude gained 0.41% to $68.01 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate rose 0.46% to $65.53, Reuters reported.Despite the modest rise, both benchmarks were down more than 10% this week, reversing gains from the initial surge following the Israel-Iran conflict.According to the US Energy Information Administration, crude inventories dropped by 5.8 million barrels in the week to June 20, far exceeding expectations, as summer driving demand increased.Still, a ceasefire between Israel and Iran has eased fears of major disruptions, limiting further gains.As per Bloomberg, markets are now shifting their attention to upcoming trade decisions in Washington and a crucial OPEC+ meeting on July 6, where production policy for August will be determined.Reuters quoted Phil Flynn of the Price Futures Group as saying, “The market is starting to digest the fact that crude oil inventories are very tight all of a sudden,” adding that a weaker dollar is also supporting prices.Despite lingering uncertainties around US trade tariffs and Iran’s future oil exports, the market’s focus has returned to fundamentals. Citi analysts noted that Trump’s swift ceasefire push “suggests he remains sensitive to high oil prices,” potentially capping geopolitical risk premiums.With investor optimism returning and central banks signalling support, Asia’s equity and credit markets appear well-positioned, though analysts warn the road ahead may still hold “a few more twists,” especially with upcoming trade deadlines.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched its highest level since November 2021.

As Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez prepare for a jaw-dropping $23–$34 million wedding in Venice, many American couples are facing the opposite challenge, trimming costs and rethinking their dream celebrations in the face of economic pressures and rising tariffs.According to USA Today, the extravagant Bezos-Sánchez affair, expected to draw stars like Mick Jagger, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Oprah Winfrey, comes at a time when the average US wedding cost just $33,000 in 2024.That’s nearly 1,000 times less than what the billionaire founder of Amazon and his fiancée are reportedly spending.Even the engagement ring Sánchez sports, a pink diamond worth $2.5 million, as revealed to Vogue, dwarfs the $5,200 average spent on rings last year, according to The Knot’s Real Weddings 2025 Study.Meanwhile, American couples are feeling the pinch from more modest but still significant financial challenges. As per USA Today, tariffs on imported flowers, gowns, and wedding supplies are quietly pushing budgets upward.Nearly 80% of flowers and 90% of bridal gowns sold in the US are imported, making them vulnerable to international trade policies.Florist and bride-to-be Allison Krivachek was quoted by USA Today as saying that she’s seen floral costs rise 10–25% due to tariffs, pushing her to get creative with sustainable, local options.“I want to make that a trend,” she said, explaining her use of potted plants and bushes that couples can replant after the ceremony.Vendors are also stepping in to help couples navigate pricing pressures. As per USA Today, Lauren Kay of The Knot said, “They want to help you have the best wedding ever... whether that’s avoiding a tariff or making a trade-off so your budget isn’t terribly impacted.”In a recent survey by The Knot, 73% of engaged couples said staying within budget was their top priority. About 36% admitted they were already adjusting plans due to inflation or economic uncertainty, with 28% reducing guest counts and others booking early or opting for US-made goods.While Bezos’ upcoming wedding has drawn sharp criticism in Venice, with protestors accusing him of symbolising inequality and exploiting the city, many Americans are simply trying to make their big day affordable.The stark contrast between the Venice spectacle and the financial reality of average weddings underscores a growing economic divide, even in moments meant for joy and celebration.","Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez are reportedly spending $23–$34 million on their wedding.

Donald Trump’s tariff wars deal a blow! US economy shrinks 0.5%; worse than estimates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-tariff-wars-deal-a-blow-us-economy-shrinks-0-5-worse-than-estimates/articleshow/122093162.cms,"Markets Cheer As Federal Court Strikes Down Trump’s Global Tariffs In Unanimous Ruling

How did imports drag down US GDP ?

The US economy shrank by 0.5% on an annual basis in the first quarter of 2025, as President Donald Trump’s trade war prompted a rush of imports, disrupting businesses, the commerce department announced on Thursday.This unexpected sharp downgrade from an earlier estimate of a 0.2% decline, reflects the economic fallout from Trump’s trade policies, which saw American firms scrambling to import goods before tariffs could take effect.The surge in imports, up by a staggering 37.9%, the fastest pace since 2020, dragged down the GDP by almost 4.7 percentage points, AP reported.This contraction marks the first quarterly decline in the US economy in three years, reversing the 2.4% growth recorded in the final three months of 2024.Consumer spending also took a significant hit, slowing to just 0.5% growth, a steep fall from the 4% recorded in the previous quarter and well below earlier government estimates.A key measure of the economy’s underlying strength, grew at an annual rate of 1.9% between January and March. That’s a noticeable slowdown from the 2.9% pace seen in the final quarter of 2024. The category includes consumer spending and private investment while excluding more volatile components such as exports, inventories and government spending.Federal government spending also slumped, falling at a 4.6% annual rate, the steepest decline since 2022.GDP or the Gross Domestic Product includes only what is produced domestically, not what is imported from foreign lands. Hence, the imports that are reflected in the GDP report as consumer spending or business investments, must be subtracted to avoid inflating figures.Economists, however, believe the slump may prove short-lived. The import-driven distortion seen in the first quarter is not expected to repeat in the April-to-June period. Many forecasters anticipate a rebound, with second-quarter GDP growth projected to reach 3%, according to a FactSet survey.The first official estimate of second-quarter GDP is due on 30 July.","US economy shrank by 0.5% on an annual basis in the first quarter of 2025.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

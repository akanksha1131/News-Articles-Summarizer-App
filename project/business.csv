Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday as the December 2025 futures contract climbed to Rs 1,70,415 per kilogram. This marks an increase of Rs 1,977 or 1.18% for the day.The surge in silver prices has resulted in a remarkable 19.8% gain for the month of October, rising from a closing price of Rs 1,42,145 on September 30. This significant monthly increase highlights strong festive demand and growing industrial interest in the metal.The recent rally has sparked renewed interest in silver's long-term potential, with analysts attributing the uptrend to solid underlying fundamentals. Mahendra Patil, Founder and Managing Partner at MP Financial Advisory Services LLP (MPFASL), noted that silver is experiencing ""a phase of structural endurance rather than speculative exuberance"", as quoted by Economic Times.Patil pointed out that while silver has historically been volatile, its past performance offers valuable insights. The metal previously approached the $50 per ounce mark in 1980 and 2011, and with 2025 marking its third such approach, the focus is now on whether it can maintain sustained momentum.In 2025, silver prices surged from $29 to over $47 per ounce, reaching ""its highest level in more than a decade."" MPFASL attributes this momentum to several factors, including ""higher expectations from US rate cuts, sustained central-bank buying, and industrial restocking across solar and electronics supply chains.""Highlighting silver's dual appeal, Patil said, ""Silver is gaining ground as both a symbolic and practical substitute. Beyond its decorative appeal, the industrial demand linked to solar panels, electronics, and electric mobility provides fundamental support to prices, creating a dual-use demand base that gold lacks.""The rise in silver demand is not limited to global markets. In India, silver imports have increased significantly. ""Silver imports have expanded, reflecting its growing relevance as an industrial and investment metal within the renewable-energy and electronics value chains,"" MPFASL reported.Data from the firm also revealed that silver delivered an annualized return of 32.92% in the CY2023–CY2025 period, with a volatility of 24.66%, based on historical performance. The correlation between gold and silver during this period stood at 0.95, indicating closely linked price movements, although silver's trajectory has increasingly been driven by industrial factors.Looking ahead, MPFASL suggests that silver may continue to benefit from its industrial underpinnings. ""Silver exceeded expectations, crossing $47 per ounce on renewed industrial restocking in solar and electronics,"" the report noted.Most projections indicate that silver is expected to remain in the $44–50 per ounce range through FY2026. While gold may experience consolidation, ""silver amplified the momentum as the cyclical bellwether of a broader industrial revival.""As India enters the festive season and global industrial restocking continues, the metal's trajectory will likely depend on sustained demand from the electronics and renewable sectors. MPFASL adds that silver's ability to surpass the $50 per ounce mark may depend on whether it can ""finally build sustained momentum and move toward the next big landmark, its metaphorical 'century.'""For domestic traders, Rs 1,70,415 now serves as a key resistance level on MCX. With industrial and festive tailwinds in play, attention will remain on whether silver can build upon this rally or consolidate near its current highs.","Silver prices soared to a record high on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Friday.

"US government shutdown: Trump admin's closure hits workers, economy; Which sectors are affected?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-government-shutdown-trump-admins-closure-hits-workers-economy-which-sectors-are-affected/articleshow/124681495.cms,"DRONE VISUALS: Millions Of Americans Revolt Against Trump Amid 'NO KINGS' Flood In U.S.

Unpaid days and job cuts

Shutdown hits economy

Tourism

Travel

Small businesses

Political standoff hardens





The federal government shutdown in the United States is moving closer to becoming the second longest in history, with no signs of a breakthrough. Some lawmakers have even warned that it could soon surpass the record 35-day shutdown that took place during US President Donald Trump’s first term.The standoff began on October 1.The Trump administration is using the shutdown to advance its priorities and cut funding for programmes it opposes, while Democrats insist that any funding deal must include support for millions of Americans who risk losing health insurance or facing steep premium increases if Congress fails to act.Here's how it has affected workers, economy and government services:As of March 31, the federal government employed around 2.3 million civilian workers. Each day, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, about 750,000 of them are furloughed, forced to stay home without pay until the shutdown ends.Others are considered “excepted” and continue working in essential services.Both groups will eventually be paid retroactively, but many could miss a full paycheck later this month after already receiving only a partial one for late September.Active-duty military personnel, roughly 1.3 million people, narrowly avoided missing their pay on Wednesday, after Trump ordered the Pentagon to redirect funds, according to AP.However, officials say another temporary fix is unlikely.The CBO estimates that paying furloughed workers who are not working is costing the government about $400 million a day.In a break from how previous administrations have handled shutdowns, the current Republican administration is moving to lay off thousands of federal employees in departments it considers low priority. A first round of job cuts affecting 4,100 workers has already been announced, with the biggest reductions at the Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education, and Housing and Urban Development departments.White House budget chief Russ Vought told “The Charlie Kirk Show” that more layoffs are coming.“I think we’ll probably end up being north of 10,000,” Vought said, as quoted by AP.“We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy,” he added. “Not just the funding, but the bureaucracy, that we now have an opportunity to do that.”Lawmakers admit many federal employees live paycheck to paycheck. Food banks in some communities have increased support, with the Capital Area Food Bank announcing extra food distributions in the Washington region from Monday to help federal workers and contractors.Economists warn that the longer the shutdown continues, the greater the economic fallout. Oxford Economics estimates that each week of the shutdown cuts US economic growth by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points. A full-quarter shutdown, which has never happened before, could reduce growth by 1.2 to 2.4 percentage points.Tourism is among the worst-hit sectors. The US Travel Association expects losses of around $1 billion a week as visitors cancel trips to national parks, historical landmarks and Washington DC Many public sites, including Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, remain shut for visitors.Air travel is feeling the strain as well. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported shortages of air traffic controllers in cities including Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Houston. Flight delays have spread to airports in Nashville, Dallas, Newark and other locations.Small businesses are also affected. The US Chamber of Commerce expects the Small Business Administration normally backs around $860 million in loans for about 1,600 small firms each week, but new loans have stopped. The shutdown has also delayed mortgage approvals and property transactions by freezing the issue and renewal of flood insurance policies.Neither side appears willing to compromise. Historically, the party that ties funding bills to demands rarely gets its way, as Republicans experienced in 2013 and 2018.Public opinion is divided. A poll by The Associated Press–NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that six in ten US adults blame Trump and congressional Republicans “a great deal” or “quite a bit” for the shutdown, while 54% also hold Democrats responsible.The administration has frozen about $18 billion for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River and an extension of New York City’s Second Avenue subway. It also cancelled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants across 16 states that backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the last presidential election. Officials say these moves are unrelated to the shutdown.Negotiations remain stuck. Republicans want health care talks to happen only after the government fully reopens. “We’re not conducting negotiations in a hostage situation,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-SD.House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said Democrats “are not going to bend and we’re not going to break because we are standing up for the American people.”","The federal government shutdown in the United States is moving closer to becoming the second longest in history.

The dilemma on festival dates

Muhurat Trading 2025: A blend of tradition and finance



Remaining stock market holidays for the year





As Diwali approaches, many are uncertain whether the festival falls on October 20 or 21 this year. As for stock markets, investors would also like to know definitive dates of the days when trading will not happen. They have a definitive date to note: the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) will be closed on Tuesday, October 21, for Diwali Lakshmi Puja, and again on Wednesday, October 22, for Balipratipada.However, on October 21, a special trading activity will occur which is the traditional Muhurat Trading session, a symbolic ritual lasting one hour, from 1:45 PM to 2:45 PM. This session will allow trading across various segments, including equities, futures and options, currency and commodity derivatives, and securities lending and borrowing (SLB), with modifications permitted until 2:55 PM.The confusion arises because the lunar calendar's Amavasya tithi, or new moon phase, technically extends into October 21. However, the auspicious time for Lakshmi Puja is on the evening of October 20, leading most households to celebrate then. The following day marks the start of the new Hindu Samvat year, celebrated with the Muhurat Trading session on Dalal Street.This year, the Muhurat session will occur in the afternoon on October 21, a departure from recent years when it was held in the evening.Additionally, markets are closed on October 18 for Dhanteras and October 19 for the regular weekend schedule.Muhurat Trading, meaning ""auspicious hour,"" is more than just a market event. It symbolizes the beginning of Samvat 2082, the new Hindu financial year. For investors, it represents optimism and a prayer for prosperity rather than a focus on profits.This tradition has persisted for decades, often bringing positive returns. The Sensex has closed higher in 14 of the past 18 Muhurat sessions. Even during the 2008 global financial crisis, the index rose by 5.86% during the session. In 2024, it gained 335 points, or 0.42%, continuing the trend of festive cheer.Analysts, as quoted by ET, point out that trading volumes are typically low during this one-hour window, leading to potential volatility. However, the session is not seen as a typical trading day but rather a symbolic reset, where traders, families, and brokers come together to mark a hopeful start to the new year.After October 22, only two more holidays remain for stock markets part from the regular Saturdays and Sundays. Markets will be shut on November 5 for Prakash Gurpurb Sri Guru Nanak Dev and December 25 for Christmas"," Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange will be closed on Tuesday, October 21, for Diwali Lakshmi Puja, and again on Wednesday, October 22, for Balipratipada.

Dhanteras 2025:

But will this rally continue? Are gold and silver good investment bets over the next year? We ask experts what the gold and silver price outlook is and what levels will they hit by Dhanteras 2026:

Dhanteras 2025: Should you buy gold and silver this year?

What’s the gold price outlook till next Dhanteras?

Gold — Diwali/Dhanteras 2026 target: ₹1,40,000–₹1,45,000+ Bull case 160000+ if geopolitical risk escalates or Fed turns very dovish. For the 12-month horizon to Dhanteras 2026, maintaining the bullish structural view, expect upside if the macro tailwinds persist — Fed cuts, weak dollar, tariffs/ geopolitical premium.Since the price has shown sharp up move recently, its advisable to allocate in dips and parts.

Silver — Dhanteras/Diwali 2026 target: ₹1,85,000–₹2,10,000/kg; Bull case ₹2,20,000–₹2,50,000+ on stronger industrial demand Central banks buying and continued ETF flows.

Buying gold and silver is traditionally considered auspicious on Dhanteras . The precious metals have been hitting new record highs this year - with the gold rally backed by global uncertainty and diversification away from dollar and the silver bull run driven by high industrial demand and acute physical tightness in London and Comex inventories.Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. According to Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, gold and silver on the domestic front have gained by over 61% and 69% respectively from 2024 Dhanteras to till now.Manav Modi is of the view that both gold and silver could be on dips from a long term perspective as an investment. “However, one should be cautious at these levels for a dip or profit booking which could provide a better entry or purchase level,” he tells TOI.Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities believes that while gold and silver are good bets, investors should not chase the peak.“For festival buying (ritual/jewellery) buy as per need; for investment, favoursystematic accumulation (SIP/laddered buys), ETFs or Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) over lump-sum physical purchases at all-time highs. Silver offers higher upside potential but comes with higher volatility,” he advises.Praveen Singh, Head of Commodities, Mirae Asset ShareKhan says that both gold and silver have strong fundamentals to rise further in the coming years.“⁠Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation. De-dollarization, central banks buying gold, inflation hedge buying, long-term government bonds losing their appeal, dent in investors’ trust in US institutions, and tariff wars will continue to provide strong tailwinds for precious metals,” he tells TOI.Gold and Silver are still poised for further upside, says Manav Modi. “Overall, from a one year perspective, Gold on COMEX could target $4250 and $4500 assuming USD-INR at 89; Rs 1,28,500 and 1,35,000. Similarly, Silver could target $75 on COMEX, from a long term perspective and Rs 2,30,000 on domestic front,” he says.Praveen Singh expects gold to reach $5000 sometime around next Dhanteras, while silver is expected to rise to $60 level. “So, silver can gain 17%, while gold may gain 21% in a year. However, due to physical market tightness in London and Indian Silver markets, it is possible that silver may beat gold in the short term, though we expect that this tightness will not last long,” he says.Abhilash Koikkara, EVP & Head- Forex and Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group is of the view that over the next 12 months, silver could maintain its outperformance over gold as gold offers portfolio stability and capital protection. “From a technical perspective, silver exhibits stronger bullish signals compared to gold, indicating a higher likelihood of outperforming gold by Dhanteras 2026,” he tells TOI.“Analytically, gold suits conservative wealth preservation, while silver suits risk-adjusted alpha seekers,” he adds.Trivedi notes that Gold has compounded at roughly 30.6% p.a., Silver 33% p.a., and Nifty 24% p.a. — silver has outperformed in percentage terms recently though gold remains the steadier hedge.Trivedi highlights LKP Securities’s working framework and targets (domestic, per 10 g / per kg):","Investors who bet on gold and silver last Dhanteras and Diwali have seen bonanza returns. Both the metals are expected to gain further on economic, political, and geopolitical uncertainties as the US Federal Reserve cuts rates into elevated inflation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124665282,imgsize-56388,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-price-outlook.jpg"

‘India Won’t Buy Russian Oil’: Trump Reiterates Despite 'Defiant' India’s Fact-check, Putin Unnerved





US President Donald Trump has once again turned up the heat on India, warning that New Delhi could face “massive” tariffs if it continues to buy Russian oil. Speaking to reporters, Trump again claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally assured him that India would stop importing crude from Moscow.“I spoke with Prime Minister Modi of India, and he said he's not going to be doing the Russian oil thing,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, repeating his claim from the past week.When asked about India’s stating it had no record of such a conversation, Trump responded, “But if they want to say that, then they'll just continue to pay massive tariffs, and they don't want to do that.”The statement adds fuel to Washington’s pressure campaign on countries still trading with Russia, especially in the energy sector, which the US argues is helping fund Moscow’s war in Ukraine.India, however, is already feeling the pinch of Trump’s tariff policies. Earlier this year, he raised import duties to 50 percent, targeting a wide range of Indian exports from textiles to pharmaceuticals.But New Delhi isn’t taking the latest claim quietly. The ministry of external affairs swiftly rejected Trump’s remarks, making it clear that India’s energy policy is guided by one goal - protecting the interests of Indian consumers.""India is a significant importer of oil and gas. It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.He further highlighted India’s twin goals of maintaining stable energy prices and ensuring secure supplies: “This includes broad-basing our energy sourcing and diversifying as appropriate to meet market conditions.”Officials added that the Trump administration has expressed interest in expanding energy cooperation with India, and that discussions on the issue are ongoing.","US President Donald Trump has turned up the heat on India, warning that New Delhi could face ""massive"" tariffs if it continues to buy Russian oil.

Beauty business: Kering sells beauty division to L'Oreal; $4.6 billion deal sealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/beauty-business-kering-sells-beauty-division-to-loreal-4-6-billion-deal-sealed/articleshow/124698036.cms,"



French luxury group Kering has agreed to sell its beauty division, including the high-end perfume brand Creed, to L’Oreal for $4.6 billion. The move marks a major step for Kering as it looks to tackle its growing debt.Under the agreement announced on Sunday, L’Oreal will also secure 50-year exclusive licences to make and sell beauty products for Kering’s top fashion houses, Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga.These licences will come into force after Kering’s current partnership with US company Coty ends in 2028.Both companies described the deal as “a long-term strategic partnership in luxury beauty and wellness”. Valued at around €4 billion overall, the transaction is subject to regulatory approval, with completion expected in the first half of 2026.“Through Creed, we will establish ourselves as one of the leading players in the fast-growing niche fragrance market,” said Nicolas Hieronimus, chief executive of L’Oreal.The deal comes shortly after Luca de Meo took over as Kering’s new CEO. He has been tasked with reducing the group’s debt, which stands at around 9.5 billion Euros . In July, Kering reported a sharp decline in earnings, with net profit down 46% to 474 million Euros in the first half of the year, and revenue dropping 16% to 7.6 billion Euros.De Meo described the sale as a “decisive step for Kering”.","French luxury group Kering has agreed to sell its beauty division, including the high-end perfume brand Creed.

NEW DELHI: The ongoing trade negotiations between the EU and India, and New Delhi’s openness to deepening economic partnerships, reinforce confidence that there is significant scope for long-term cooperation, a top European Investment Bank (EIB) official has said but called for accelerating approvals and providing a level-playing field for global investors.“Despite the current geopolitical uncertainties in South Asia, India stands out as a country of remarkable resilience and opportunity,” Nicola Beer, vice president of the European Investment Bank (EIB) told TOI during her visit to India, during which she unveiled a string of investments from upgrading water infrastructure in Uttarakhand to metro projects in Nagpur and Pune to strengthening participation in the India Transition Fund. “For EIB, which has committed over 5.6 billion euro to India in last 20 years with more than 90% dedicated to climate action, this means India remains a highly attractive destination for investment, particularly in sectors that align with both India’s and Europe’s priorities,” said Beer. EIB is one of the world’s largest multilateral banks.She said sustainable transport is leading EIB investment in India and EIB has signed 3.6 billion euro in loans for metro projects in the country, making India the largest recipient of EIB urban mobility financing outside the EU, with metro projects in cities like Agra, Bengaluru, Pune, Nagpur, Lucknow, Bhopal and Kanpur.“Energy transition is another key area, especially renewables, energy efficiency, and grid infrastructure,” Beer said when asked about the priority sector for EIB. “These sectors not only address India’s development needs but also create opportunities for technology and investment flows between India and the EU,” said Beer.She cited the $60 million commitment to the India Energy Transition Fund, managed by EAAA Alternatives, as an example of engaging with the private sector.Beer said this fund is designed to channel equity and “last mile” financing into greenfield infrastructure and growth-stage companies, accelerating projects in renewables, energy efficiency and clean mobility.“The fund is expected to mobilise significant additional private capital, including from leading European institutional investors, and to foster innovation in areas like battery storage and circular economy.” She said while the opportunities are significant, there are still some barriers to greater European investment in India.","“Despite the current geopolitical uncertainties in South Asia, India stands out as a country of remarkable resilience and opportunity,” Nicola Beer, vice president of the European Investment Bank (EIB) told TOI during her visit to India.

SAN FRANCISCO: BFSI, retail and manufacturing will drive the US-based IT firm Salesforce’s growth in India over the next three years, a top executive of the company said.“The three-year agenda remains more or less the same. We still see a lot of growth coming out of the BFSI sector and retail sector. We see plenty of growth in manufacturing, travel, tourism, hotels and healthcare. So many of these sectors are showing pretty steady and good growth,” Salesforce South Asia CEO Arundhati Bhattacharya said.“Even smaller sectors, like real estate and education are showing pretty good growth. So in India, I would say that the growth remains pretty consistent in the areas that we have been in, and we continue to see momentum over there. With the newer kinds of technologies that are coming in, there is a lot of openness as to how it should be developed, or how it should be absorbed,” she said.The global customer relationship management (CRM) technology solutions giant Salesforce expects its revenues to cross $41 billion in FY26 at the global level.Salesforce started operations in India in 2005 with its first centre of excellence in Hyderabad. Now the company is spread to six locations in India with an annual revenue of $1 billion with a workforce of over 13,000. India is the second biggest market for the company after the US.","BFSI, retail and manufacturing will drive the US-based IT firm Salesforce’s growth in India.

GST reforms benefitted sector indirectly: Campari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-reforms-benefitted-sector-indirectly-campari/articleshow/124695332.cms,"



NEW DELHI: While alcoholic liquor for human consumption remains outside the ambit of GST, recent reforms in this taxation have benefitted the industry indirectly. Campari Group (India) MD Shivam Misra has told TOI that several upstream and allied services in the value chain now carry clarified and, in many cases, concessional, rates. “For route-to-market, this translates into cleaner invoices, fewer classification disputes, and less friction in transport and multimodal logistics,” he says about the impact GST 2.0’s simplified rate architecture will have on the industry.“A key foundation for these gains was laid last year, when extra neutral alcohol (ENA) used for potable spirits was excluded from GST with effect from Nov 1, 2024, preventing federal levies from being stranded as costs and directly addressing ‘tax-on-tax’ concerns, since state duties are computed on a base that otherwise included federal taxes. From a supply chain perspective, GST 2.0 reduces ambiguity on service rates, particularly transport and multimodal, while last year’s ENA decision removed a structural distortion. Together, they free up working capital and create a more predictable compliance environment,” Misra said.Misra does not see tariff cuts post free trade agreements (FTA) “flooding” the Indian market. “Supply is structurally paced by scotch’s minimum three-year maturation cycle and allocations across over 180 global markets.What we are more likely to see is steady premiumisation and a clearer value ladder, not sudden distortion,” he said.With alcohol being a state subject, the VAT/excise structures are determined locally and evolve independently of GST. “Recent developments have been mixed. For instance, Maharashtra raised VAT on liquor to 10% and increased certain fees for FY26, while other states are reviewing frameworks to curb cascading and cross-border arbitrage alongside GST 2.0. Any reductions, where they occur, remain jurisdiction-specific and subject to state notifications. Where downward calibrations are introduced, they are welcome for both consumer protection and compliance predictability.”So, overall what has changed for the ecosystem post the GST reforms and FTA? “For consumers, there is a more transparent tax stack on upstream services and a tariff glide path that broadens access to global styles at rational price points - without incentivising excess consumption.. For the value chain, there is lower cascading and clarified logistics/job-work rates (like 5% GST with conditions on key transport modes) meaning cleaner billing, reduced frictional costs, and more efficient operations. And for ‘make in India,’ qualifying bulk under FTAs and permitted blending elevates domestic quality and strengthens premium IMFL offerings, bridging to bottled-in-origin,” he said.","Several upstream and allied services in the value chain now carry clarified and, in many cases, concessional, rates. “For route-to-market, this translates into cleaner invoices, fewer classification disputes, and less friction in transport and multimodal logistics,” says Campari Group (India) MD Shivam Misra.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124695331,imgsize-223378,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

MUMBAI: RBL Bank aims to become one of India's large banks within three to five years, leveraging a strategic tie-up with UAE based Emirates NBD, its managing director and chief executive R Subramaniakumar said.The foreign lender will invest around $3 billion through a preferential-issue to acquire a 60% stake, triggering an open-offer under regulatory guidelines.Subramaniakumar called the partnership a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity"" to scale RBL's balance-sheet, digital-capabilities, and corporate-reach.""Our aspiration is to move into the league of the large banks.

Diwali 2025: Bengal markets see brisk Dhanteras sales; gold & silver demand surges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/diwali-2025-bengal-markets-see-brisk-dhanteras-sales-gold-and-silver-demand-surges/articleshow/124692220.cms,"Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices





Kolkata and other parts of West Bengal witnessed brisk business on Dhanteras, despite high gold prices, as improved consumer sentiment, GST benefits, and the enduring reputation of gold as a robust investment drove sales. Retailers of other goods also reported strong demand, reflecting a broader festive buying spree.Key markets in Kolkata, including Gariahat and Burrabazar, saw overwhelming footfall, with long queues outside jewellery stores. “A combination of reduced GST slabs, strong emotional sentiment around the festival, and gold’s reputation as a safe investment has spurred record demand. India’s traditional market movement is phenomenal this year,” Ashok Bengani, president of the Calcutta Gem & Jewellers Welfare Association, told PTI.He added that celebrity endorsements have further boosted consumer trust. Jewellers noted a mix of traditional and modern buying patterns. Families purchased gold for auspicious reasons, while younger, budget-conscious shoppers opted for smaller, lighter pieces and flexible payment plans.“Dhanteras this year tells two stories. Families still want to mark the festival with something precious, while newer and more budget-savvy choices have risen quickly.We’re expecting a 20-25 per cent rise in value terms compared to last year, though volumes are down by around 12-15 per cent, showing that buyers are prioritising design and emotional value over quantity,” Suvankar Sen, MD and CEO of Senco Gold & Diamonds told PTI.""There's also a noticeable increase in men purchasing chains and bracelets, not just as adornment but as investment,"" Sen added.Stunned and diamond jewellery gained traction, and men’s jewellery—chains and bracelets—also saw rising demand. “The younger generation is now using gold as an investment class in a big way. Many see better long-term returns in gold than in equity,” Bengani noted.Sales across Kolkata, including Bow Bazaar and Gariahat, remained strong throughout the weekend. Anjali Jewellers Director Annargha Uuttiya Chowdhury said, “Customers are buying both heavy and medium-weight jewellery ahead of the wedding season to beat potential price hikes. Working women and students prefer lighter pieces, and the men’s segment is on an uptrend.”Silver also glittered, though prices retreated from peaks, settling around Rs 1,72,000 per kilogram, still over 65 per cent higher than last Dhanteras. Nationwide, nearly 30 tonnes of gold are estimated to have been sold during the festival period.Demand extended beyond physical stores, with Gold ETFs seeing strong inflows, reaching Rs 8,363.13 crore in September, nearly six times higher than a year ago. Total assets under management jumped 126.34 per cent year-on-year to Rs 90,135.98 crore, reflecting renewed investor confidence.","Kolkata and other parts of West Bengal witnessed brisk business on Dhanteras, despite high gold prices.

Reduced taxes to boost luxe spend: Rado,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/reduced-taxes-to-boost-luxe-spend-rado/articleshow/124695306.cms,"



MUMBAI: The trade agreement between India and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) will allow Swiss luxury watch brands to offer more competitive pricing in the South Asian country, widening their appeal, said Adrian Bosshard, CEO at Rado which counts India as its biggest market, surpassing top luxury spenders China and the US.The trade pact under which India will reduce basic customs duty on Swiss watches, bringing it down to zero over a seven-year period will also compensate companies for currency losses (fluctuations in currency rates can erode earnings for exporters), Bosshard said. “I am very happy we were able to sign this agreement with India as step-by-step, taxes will be reduced. When you take out high taxes from a product, it’s definitely an advantage, without a doubt. It’s easier to buy luxury goods in places like Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Switzerland because of lower taxes,” Bosshard told TOI in an interview.For Rado, India has been recording a double-digit growth rate every year on the back of a broadening consumer base—while the firm’s old patrons continue to shop for its statement watches, the younger lot too is splurging on the luxury brand, many of whom are spending on its entry range collection starting at about Rs 1 lakh.“They are largely young working professionals who perceive a watch to be more than just a device displaying time—it’s an “experience, a statement,” Bosshard said.“This growth has come despite our distribution being at the same level. It is coming from the fact that more and more Indians can afford our watches due to rising purchasing power. India has a young, ambitious and hard-working population which is entering the luxury market,” said Bosshard. The brand’s local young shoppers in fact, are even spending on its more expensive selection such as Captain Cook which usually comes with a price tag of over Rs 2 lakh. The pre-Diwali sales in Sept have been very strong for Rado and the brand hopes to maintain the same trajectory for the festival-heavy month of Oct.The China market, Bosshard said, is still quite challenging for the luxury segment although the region seems to be stabilising gradually. The 39% US tariff on Switzerland came as a “big shock”, Bosshard said, adding that he hopes the rate can be renegotiated and brought at a level similar to the European Union which has been taxed at 15%. “We have a local US subsidiary and we were able to build up stock locally before the (tariff) decision was taken. That has helped us in the short term,” Bosshard said. Rado has raised prices in the US market but its sales have not been impacted given the scale and purchasing power of the market.","Rado counts India as its biggest market, surpassing top luxury spenders China and the US.

"Wall Street week ahead! US markets eyes volatility: Tesla, Netflix earnings & delayed CPI report in focus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-week-ahead-us-markets-eyes-volatility-tesla-netflix-earnings-delayed-cpi-report-in-focus/articleshow/124692382.cms,"Wall Street week ahead:





US stock markets are showing signs of shakiness as investors prepare for a week packed with corporate earnings and delayed inflation data.According to a Reuters report, major companies such as Tesla and Netflix are expected to provide a clearer picture of corporate profits, while the delayed September Consumer Price Index (CPI) will test market resilience.The fourth year of the S&P 500’s bull run began with notable swings after a long period of calm, driven by renewed US -China trade tensions and credit concerns at regional US banks. The CBOE market volatility index (VIX), known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” surged to its highest level in nearly six months on Friday.“The market is becoming more volatile, but it's also coming off of a very non-volatile period where we didn’t have a lot of risk catalysts bubbling to the top,” Michael Reynolds, VP of investment strategy at Glenmede told Reuters.“Once you have valuations hit sort of full levels, as we're seeing now almost across the board, you have to be on the lookout for incremental risk catalysts,” Reynolds added.The immediate trigger for volatility was a resurgence in US-China trade tensions. Stocks dropped last week after the US threatened to significantly hike tariffs by November 1 over China’s rare-earth export controls.President Donald Trump confirmed he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in two weeks, keeping markets on alert.Credit worries at regional US banks also contributed to market jitters. While major indexes posted weekly gains, underlying trends point to cracks.According to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, the percentage of S&P 500 stocks in an uptrend has dropped from 77% in early July to 57%, while downtrends have increased from 23% to 44%. “That narrowing gap highlights emerging cracks in the market’s foundation,” he said.“If you have a fewer number of companies that are actually moving higher, but the indexes do move higher because of the megacaps, that's a really important divergence,” Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, emphasised the importance of breadth in market gains, told Reuters.Investors will closely watch third-quarter earnings, with reports from companies including Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and major tech and aerospace firms, alongside Tesla and Netflix.With the US government shutdown halting economic data releases since October 1, corporate reports offer the best insight into broader economic health. “Corporate reports and what companies say is really our best chance at assessing what the broader economic health is,” Gordon added.The delayed CPI report, set for release on Friday, comes just days before the Federal Reserve’s October 28-29 meeting, where a quarter-point rate cut is widely anticipated.“We’d really have to see something out of left field in terms of notable inflation pressures to knock the Fed off of a rate cut path at the October meeting,” Reynolds added.","US stock markets are showing signs of shakiness as investors prepare for a week packed with corporate earnings and delayed inflation data.

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices





HSBC on Friday projected that gold prices could surge to $5,000 an ounce in the first half of 2026, driven by geopolitical risks, economic uncertainty, and a wave of new market participants.As per news agency Reuters, the bank also raised its average gold price forecast for 2025 to $3,455 per ounce from $3,355, while its 2026 average estimate was lifted to $4,600 per ounce from $3,950.“Unlike previous rallies, we believe many of these new buyers are likely to stay in the gold space — even after the rally ends — not so much for appreciation necessarily as for gold’s diversification and ‘safe haven’ qualities,” HSBC said in a research note.The bank highlighted that robust central bank purchases, rising ETF inflows, expectations of US rate cuts, and tariff-related uncertainties have fueled the current rally.Spot gold recently breached the $4,300 mark, marking its strongest weekly gain since December 2008.HSBC expects prices to remain elevated through early 2026, although volatility and some moderation could occur in the second half of the year.“The bull market is likely to continue to press prices higher for 1H’26 and we could very well reach a high of $5,000/oz some time in 1H 2026,” the note added.Other major banks share a similarly bullish outlook. Bank of America and Societe Generale have also forecast gold reaching $5,000 per ounce next year, while ANZ predicts a peak near $4,600 by June 2026, with gradual easing thereafter, reported ET.Analysts attribute the rally to continued safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions, economic policy uncertainty, and expectations of a weakening US dollar.The sustained demand is expected from central banks, institutional funds, and retail investors seeking diversification and protection against economic volatility.HSBC and other analysts underscore that gold’s appeal is not just speculative but rooted in its long-term store-of-value and risk-hedging qualities, reinforcing its role as a key asset amid global uncertainties, as per Reuters.Gold’s trajectory in 2025 and 2026 is being closely watched by markets worldwide, with forecasts indicating that the metal is poised to stay above $4,000 an ounce for the foreseeable future, even as short-term fluctuations occur.","HSBC projects that gold prices could surge to $5,000 an ounce in the first half of 2026.

US auto tariffs: Donald Trump offers American car makers additional relief; truck parts face 25% duty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-auto-tariffs-donald-trump-offers-us-car-makers-additional-relief-truck-parts-face-25-duty/articleshow/124654049.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Friday signed an order that provides relief for American carmakers while introducing a 25% tariff on truck parts.The White House said the order extends an arrangement allowing companies to reduce tariffs on imported vehicle parts. At the same time, it imposes a 25% tariff on medium and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, starting November 1.The moves follow a Section 232 investigation this year into truck imports, launched to assess their impact on national security. Trump has previously used such investigations under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on goods ranging from steel and aluminium to autos. The goal is to encourage domestic manufacturing and penalise countries he believes are taking advantage of the US.Currently, firms importing parts for vehicles built in the US can offset 3.75% of a car’s list price. This benefit was due to be gradually reduced and then ended, but the new order extends the 3.75% offset through 2030 without change.A similar system will now apply to medium and heavy-duty trucks. Officials cited by AFP said that the measures are designed to reward US-based production.Despite the new 25% tariff on imported trucks, senior US officials told journalists some trucks will still get preferential treatment under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).Around 78% of heavy truck imports come from Mexico and 15% from Canada, according to Capital Economics. Under the new rules, only the non-US content of USMCA-eligible trucks will face the tariff. Eligible parts will enter duty-free until the Commerce Department sets rules to assess their non-US content.Imported buses will face a 10% tariff and will not qualify for USMCA benefits, officials added.The tariffs come amid ongoing trade talks with Canada and Mexico. The levies are already affecting Mexico, with exports of heavy vehicles to the US dropping nearly 26% year-on-year between January and August.","The White House said the order extends an arrangement allowing companies to reduce tariffs on imported vehicle parts.

China and US might be set for of more negotiations as both countries agree to hold a fresh round of trade talks ""as soon as possible."" This announcement comes as both economic giants aim to avoid another cycle of damaging tariffs.The decision followed a video call between Beijing’s chief negotiator, Vice Premier He Lifeng, and US treasury secretary Scott Bessent.State news agency Xinhua, on Saturday, described the discussion as involving ""candid, in-depth and constructive exchanges.""Earlier on Friday, the US President said that his proposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods would not be sustainable, and Beijing ""forced him to do it.""""It's not sustainable,"" Trump told Fox Business when asked if the levies he has threatened to impose on China could remain in place without significantly affecting the economy.Tensions between the US and China escalated after Trump announced plans to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods from November 1, following China’s restrictions on rare earth mineral exports.With the additional tariffs, Chinese imports to the country now face a total of 130% duty.Washington's move was in repoonse to China's restriction on its rare earth exports.""Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position... the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,"" Trump said on Truth Social.In response, Beijing warned of retaliation if the US goes ahead with the tariff threat and accused it of escalating tensions.""Wilful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,"" a spokesperson for the commerce ministry said on Sunday, according to state news agency Xinhua.Meanwhile, despite Trump’s earlier statement that he would not meet Xi at this month’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, a meeting between the two leaders still appears possible.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he continues to expect the meeting to take place.

"FAA nod for 737 Max: Two years after door plug incident, Boeing allowed to hike production; max output limit 42 per month",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/faa-nod-for-737-max-two-years-after-door-plug-incident-boeing-allowed-to-hike-production-max-output-limit-42-per-month/articleshow/124651860.cms,"



Boeing on Friday received green light from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to increase monthly production of its 737 Max aircraft, following reviews and inspections.The plane maker can now make 42 jets per month, up from the previous limit of 38. The cap had been introduced after a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines plane in January 2024, sparking renewed concerns about Boeing’s safety standards.Although the FAA set the limit last year, Boeing’s actual production fell below the ceiling for a long stretch. Investigations and a machinists’ strike, which halted work for almost eight weeks, slowed output. By the second quarter of this year, however, Boeing reached the cap and signalled it would ask regulators for permission to produce more.A Boeing spokesperson said the company had followed a “disciplined process” to make sure it was ready to scale up safely, working in line with the guidelines and performance goals that it agreed on with the FAA.“We appreciate the work by our team, our suppliers and the FAA to ensure we are prepared to increase production with safety and quality at the forefront,” Boeing said in a statement cited by AFP.The FAA stressed that its decision does not mean reduced oversight. Inspectors will continue to monitor Boeing’s factories, and their work has carried on even during the US government shutdown that began on October 1.The agency recently restored Boeing’s authority to carry out final safety inspections on 737 Max jets and issue flight certificates, something it was not allowed to do for more than six years.The FAA assumed control of approvals in 2019 after two fatal crashes of the then-new model killed 346 people. Investigators later blamed a software system created by Boeing for the accidents.Boeing’s production plans have also been under political scrutiny. Earlier this year, CEO Kelly Ortberg appeared before a Senate committee, where lawmakers pressed him on whether safety was being prioritised over profit, AFP reported.""Just to be very clear, we won’t ramp up production if the performance isn’t indicating a stable production system,"" Ortberg said during a hearing in April.“We will continue to work on getting to a stable system.”The Alaska Airlines incident was one of several alleged safety breaches at Boeing between September 2023 and February 2024. The FAA is seeking $3.1 million in fines from the company over these violations.","Boeing can now make 42 jets per month, up from the previous limit of 38.

"US chamber of commerce sues Trump administration over $100,000 H-1B fee",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-chamber-of-commerce-sues-trump-administration-over-100000-h-1b-fee/articleshow/124627901.cms,"File photo

‘Not An Annual Fee’: White House Issues Clarification Amid Confusion Over H-1B Visa Fee Order





Corporate America, for long pally with Republican dispensations in Washington, is suing the Trump administration over the $100,000 annual fee for H1B visa, saying the astronomical hike in charges is misguided, unlawful, and detrimental to US businesses.In a federal lawsuit filed before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, which counts giants like Microsoft, WalMart, Exxon Mobil, Amazon, and Pfizer among its members, said the Trump administration has exceeded its statutory authority in announcing the new fee and sought an immediate injunction to block the policy's enforcement.The lawsuit targets a presidential proclamation issued last month, titled ""Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,"" which fundamentally re-engineers the financial structure of the H-1B program. Under the new rule, new H-1B visa petitions, primarily for foreign workers outside the US (about 70 percent of whom come from India), must be accompanied or supplemented by a $100,000 payment.Arguing that the new fee blatantly contravenes the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) which governs the H-1B program, the lawsuit contends that a $100,000 tab countermands Congress's judgment that the program should provide a pathway for up to 85,000 people annually to contribute their talents to the United States.By unilaterally imposing such an extreme financial barrier, the Chamber argues that the President has unlawfully usurped legislative authority designed to manage the flow of skilled workers.While the Chamber is dominated by corporate giants, Neil Bradley, its Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer stressed the disproportionate harm the fee will inflict on smaller enterprises. ""The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and mid-sized businesses, to utilize the H-1B program,"" Bradley said in a statement. For many start-ups, a $100,000 fee per new employee represents an unsustainable burden that will force them to forgo H1Bs at a time when there is a shortage of qualified STEM graduates in America.The Trump administration has however vigorously defended the measure, asserting it a ""necessary, initial, incremental step"" aimed at ensuring the visa is used strictly to recruit ""great engineers"" and highest-paid talent, rather than for entry-level positions. The policy is rooted in the administration’s core argument -- drummed by some MAGA activists -- that some employers have exploited H-1B loopholes to suppress American wages, displace U.S. workers, and ""spam the system"" by filing high volumes of petitions for lower-skilled roles.Critics warn though that the punitive financial barrier risks triggering a reverse ""brain drain,"" pushing highly sought-after foreign talent toward economic rivals abroad. China and Germany among other nations have opened their doors to foreign talent, and many Indian professionals navigating the uncertain H1B scenario are looking to peel off to neighboring Canada or return home. The Chamber asserts that diminishing the U.S ability to attract and retain the ""world's best and brightest"" threatens the competitiveness and expansion of American companies in the global marketplace.The lawsuit represents a remarkable rift between the Chamber and the Republican White House – allies for long – amid growing disquiet in corporate circles over what some have dubbed as “Right Wing Socialism.” Conservative commentators are flagging actions like President Trump using emergency powers to impose tariffs, the government taking a stake in private corporations like Intel, and hiking H1B fees, saying the moves go against the spirit of free market enterprise that has long characterized the United States.","The U.S Chamber of Commerce is suing the Trump administration over the $100,000 annual fee for H1B visa.

The global economy is going through a period of enhanced turmoil with the trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump . Amidst this uncertainty, International Monetary Fund IMF ) MD Kristalina Georgieva has said that world leaders and central bank governors need to ‘buckle up’.Deepak Ajwani, Editor, Economic Times Online asked IMF what that entails. Pierre Olivier Gourinchas, Chief Economist, International Monetary Fund replied with a four-pronged strategy.“We've been living for the last five, seven years, in an environment in which the global economy is hit by fairly sizable shocks. They can be very concentrated. We can think of covid that was the one in maybe in 100 years, a type of shock. But even after that, with the cost of living crisis, we had the impact of military conflict on European soil. You had the trade tensions. All of these things are disruptive to the global economy. ” he told ET.“Now, for many countries in the world, these things are outside their control. These are not something that you directly have an input and can do something about. So the first part of buckling up is to make sure your economy is as resilient as it can be.And how would you make your economy resilient? Well, number one, you make sure that you have the fiscal buffers that you need, because you're going to need to use them when you're hit by one of these shocks, and if you don't have them, then the impact is going to be much larger. So make sure you protect the fiscal buffers,” he said.“Second, make sure that you have the right institutional environment, so that you have institutions that are trusted, that can do their job, that have frameworks that are strong. That is also going to be helpful in maintaining expectations, in maintaining some sense of stability in the economy,” he elaborated.Pierre Olivier Gourinchas is of the view that countries have to be open to deepening trade ties. “You're going to have to rely on trading partners. No country is an island that can do things on their own, and so making sure that countries remain part of the global economy, that they are integrated, that they find ways to deepen trade ties with partners where it's possible, is an important part also of building that resilience,” he said.“And fourth, growth comes from the private sector. It comes from adoption of technologies that have been developed elsewhere. Most countries are not at the frontier of innovation. Most countries are inside that frontier and catching up with it, or developing that frontier, making sure that the right efforts are made in terms of scaling the labor force in terms of adoption of technology in terms of infrastructure investment so that countries can grow rapidly and unleash private sector innovation and entrepreneurship,” he added.The International Monetary Fund announced on Tuesday that the United States and worldwide economies are expected to demonstrate stronger growth this year than earlier predictions, as the impact of Trump-era tariffs has been less severe than anticipated, although the complete effects remain to be seen.According to the IMF's influential World Economic Outlook semi-annual report, the American economy is projected to grow by 2 per cent in 2025. This represents an increase from the previous forecasts of 1.9 per cent in July and 1.8 per cent in April.The IMF's projections indicate that the US economy will expand by 2.1 per cent in the following year, marginally higher than their earlier prediction by one-tenth of a percentage point.The worldwide economic growth forecast has been revised upwards to 3.2 per cent for this year, improving from the July estimate of 3 per cent. For 2026, the IMF maintains its previous projection of 3.1 per cent growth.",IMF Chief Economist Pierre Olivier Gourinchas says world leaders and central bank governors need to 'buckle up' He says the first part of buckling up is to make sure your economy is as resilient as it can be.

Spirit Airlines announced on Thursday its decision to furlough 365 pilots and downgrade the status of up to 170 pilots in the first quarter of 2026, as part of a broader workforce reduction strategy amid ongoing restructuring efforts.The ultra-low-cost carrier, which filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year this past August, informed the pilots' union of its intention to cut $100 million in annual pilot-related expenses to preserve cash reserves, reported Reuters. ""In line with our ongoing restructuring, we are implementing further measures to align staffing levels with our previously announced capacity reductions and a smaller operating fleet,"" Spirit Airlines stated.Chief operating officer John Bendoraitis, in a memo obtained by Reuters, indicated that the number of furloughs might decrease in the coming weeks due to voluntary attrition. The company plans to open the bid process at the end of November.Currently, Spirit Airlines employs approximately 2,400 pilots. The airline had previously furloughed around 330 pilots and is set to furlough an additional 270 in November. Additionally, Spirit plans to furlough about 1,800 flight attendants, representing roughly one-third of its cabin crew, effective December 1.The Florida-based airline also announced impending reductions across its corporate teams and intends to make staffing adjustments at its maintenance stations based on volume. The carrier will also close its maintenance stations and warehouse operations in Baltimore and Chicago, effective January 1, 2026.In a recent filing, Spirit Airlines projected that the furloughs would save the company $211 million. The airline anticipates incurring losses of $804 million in 2025 and stated that its transformation plan aims to return to profitability by 2027, necessitating a network reduction in 2026.","Spirit Airlines announced on Thursday its decision to furlough 365 pilots and downgrade the status of up to 170 pilots in the first quarter of 2026.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

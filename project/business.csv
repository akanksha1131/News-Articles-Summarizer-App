Trump’s promise of tariff payments









US President Donald Trump on Friday gave a sigh of relief to American consumers with the announcement of cutting tariffs on a range of products such as beef, coffee, tropical fruits and other commodities. This comes as a major shift in his trade policy as the White House moves to address rising costs for US shoppers.Trump has built his second term on levying tariffs on imported goods, aiming to boost domestic production and strengthen the US economy. His decision to lift tariffs on foods central to American diets follows recent off-year elections, in which economic concerns played a decisive role, contributing to Democratic wins in Virginia, New Jersey, and other key races.“We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods like coffee,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while travelling to Florida hours after the announcement.When asked whether his tariffs had contributed to higher prices for Americans, the president said, “I say they may, in some cases. But to a large extent they’ve been borne by other countries,” AP cited the US president.Inflation remains high despite Trump’s repeated claims that it has disappeared since he took office in January, keeping pressure on household budgets.While the administration has argued that tariffs have primarily helped government revenues, Democrats have portrayed Friday’s move as a tacit admission that these policies have hurt American consumers.“President Trump is finally admitting what we always knew: his tariffs are raising prices for the American people,” said Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer.“After getting drubbed in recent elections because of voters’ fury that Trump has broken his promises to fix inflation, the White House is trying to cast this tariff retreat as a ‘pivot to affordability.’”Trump’s tariffs, imposed globally in April, have faced criticism for contributing to high prices for staples such as beef, particularly from Brazil. However, with the new tariff cuts, many producets will become more affordable for Americans.The new executive order also removes tariffs on:Many of these products are not produced domestically, meaning the tariffs had little effect on encouraging US production, but the removal is expected to ease prices for consumers.The Food Industry Association welcomed the decision, calling it “swift tariff relief” and emphasising that import taxes are “an important factor” amid broader supply chain issues. “President Trump’s proclamation to reduce tariffs on a substantial volume of food imports is a critical step ensuring continued adequate supply at prices consumers can afford,” the association said.The White House noted that some tariffs were no longer necessary due to trade agreements negotiated with key partners. Framework agreements with Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Argentina aim to boost US exports while potentially easing tariffs on agricultural products from those countries.Earlier in the week, Trump had hinted at tariff cuts in an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, saying, “Coffee, we’re going to lower some tariffs. We’re going to have some coffee come in.”Trump indicated that revenue from tariffs could fund $2,000 payments for many Americans, possibly in 2026, though he did not specify a timeline.He also suggested the money could be used to reduce national debt. Defending the move against inflation concerns, Trump said, “This is money earned as opposed to money that was made up. Everybody but the rich will get this. That’s not made up. That’s real money. That comes from other countries.”","US President Donald Trump on Friday gave a sigh of relief to American consumers with the announcement of cutting tariffs on a range of products such as beef, coffee, tropical fruits and other commodities.

Benchmark indices ended their two-week losing streak and are trading firmly higher this week, in line with gains across global markets. Investor confidence has strengthened as the US government shutdown came to an end, with growing expectations of early Federal Reserve rate cuts amid signs of a slowdown in the U.S. job market. Additionally, India’s CPI data came in at a record low, while exit polls from the Bihar election indicating a majority for the ruling NDA further lifted sentiment. Hopes of an India–US trade deal also added to the positive momentum.Market trajectory in the upcoming week is likely to be driven by the outcome of the Bihar election, scheduled for release tomorrow, and key developments surrounding the anticipated India–U.S. trade agreement. Both factors are expected to act as major sentiment catalysts and could trigger heightened volatility across broader indices.Going forward, the broader market structure remains constructive, and we maintain a bullish bias.We recommend utilizing any corrective declines as accumulation opportunities for the next leg of the uptrend, with upside targets placed at 26,100, followed by a potential retest of the all-time high near the 26,277 zone in the coming weeks.In line with expectations, buying demand during last week emerged from the support area of 25,500-25,300. We expect the index to hold above the same being the confluence of the following technical observations.Among the oscillators, the daily 14 periods RSI has recently generated a buy signal thus supports the overall positive bias in the index.Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in the range of 57200-58600 for the fourth week in a row and is currently placed around the upper band of the range.Going ahead we expect the index to break above the upper band of the consolidation range and head towards 59,000 and 59,800 levels in the coming weeks being the measuring implication of the last 4 weeks range.On the downside, the lower band of the consolidation range at 57,300–57,100, which coincides with the recent breakout zone and the 20-day EMA, is likely to act as a strong support area.Among the oscillators, the daily 14 periods RSI has recently generated a buy signal thus supports the overall positive bias in the index.CG Power is highly optimistic, driven by structural industry tailwinds (T&D capex, railway modernization, Make in India), aggressive capacity expansion, and a strategic push into semiconductors and services. Company benefits from a diverse customer base, a strong manufacturing foundation, continuous R&D and product development, and rising export opportunities.The company faces challenges from the cyclical nature of the power business, increasing transformer supply in India, and its lack of prior experience in semiconductors. We have valued the company using the P/E valuation method, applying a 57x multiple on FY28E earnings, arriving at a target price of Rs 798.The stock is forming base around the 80% retracement of the previous major up move of October 2025 and has witnessed a shallow retracement of its previous up move signaling overall positive bias in the stock.We expect the stock to resume up move and head towards 7980 levels in the coming month being the confluence of the previous major high and key retracement of the current decline.Among the oscillators the daily stochastic has approached oversold territory and is seen rebounding from the same thus signals pullback in the coming months.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 14, 2025 are CG Power and Industrial Solutions, and Apollo Hospitals Enterprise.

Gold Price Outlook

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Gold price ended last week almost flat showing consolidated moves while positive developments over US Shutdown reopening over the weekend revived prospects for rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in December shifting focus back to deteriorating US Fiscal outlook. US private jobs data released last week indicated a weak labour market, further supporting the US rate cut prospects. US Challenger job data also indicated a spike in job cuts, suggesting a possible cooling in US labour market conditions.CME Fed funds tool showed rate cut possibility for December 10 -11 meeting have risen to above 90 % now from around 66 % yesterday. Worries about the potential economic fallout from the longest-ever US government shutdown turned out to be a key factor that continued to underpin demand for the safe-haven commodity as the yellow metal rose to three week highs in the current week.Inflation concerns also persisted as President Donald Trump floated the idea of sending American rebate checks of at least $ 2000 a person (excluding high income people) for the tariffs that his administration has collected which provided additional support to yellow metal.In other news, China central bank continued to buy gold for 12th Consecutive month as data showed China's official gold reserves stood at 74.09 MOz at the end of October up 74.06 Moz from a month earlier, which meant PBoC bought nearly one tonne which continued to boost sentiments in Gold.Meanwhile spot silver rose more than 4 % to above $50 per oz, reaching its highest since October 21. The US, which added copper, and silver to its critical minerals list, also provided structural support for precious and industrial metals. However, the supply shortage which persisted in October has likely eased now indicating an unlikely scenario for new highs in spot, but prices could still find support from uncertain economic conditions in the US which could keep safe haven flows intact in white metal.In the near term, gold is expected to test its resistance zone around $ 4190 – 4210 per oz (CMP $ 4135/Oz) while buying on dips could remain a favourable strategy for the metal. Support for the yellow metal could persist in the range of $ 4110 – 4075 per oz in near term. On MCX futures (CMP 124,850/10 gm) prices are expected to witness strong supports in the range of 1,23,800 – 1,22,900 per 10 gm levels in near term as resistance on higher side to remain at around Rs, 1,26,500 – 1,27,900 /10 gm levels for the week.Looking ahead for the week, volatility in prices could also occur at higher levels driven by fluctuations in the dollar index and global financial market as traders could closely monitor the US October Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data later on Thursday. The headline CPI is expected to show an increase of 0.2% MoM in October, while the core CPI is projected to show a rise of 0.3% MoM during the same period. The US Retail Sales will be in the spotlight on Friday.Silver could also trade with a positive bias as a rise towards $ 52. 20 - 52.50 per oz (CMP $ 51.10/Oz) in spot cannot be ruled out in near term. Strong support could persist in the range of $ 50.20 – 49.50 /Oz levels. On MCX futures contract (CMP Rs. 1,55,500/Kg.) This could translate to a support level of Rs. 1,52,500–1,50,800 / Kg & resistance at Rs 1,58,000 - 1,59,500/Kg levels for the week.","Gold prices are expected to face upside resistance, and buying on dips may be a favourable strategy, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

US government shutdown: Supreme Court extends block on Snap payments; hopes rise for potential end to standoff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-govt-shutdown-supreme-court-extends-block-on-snap-payments-hopes-rise-for-potential-end-to-standoff/articleshow/125263032.cms,"1000+ Flights Cancelled As Shutdown Severely Impacts American Aviation Sector

Snap benefits









The US Supreme Court had, once again, refused to order the Trump administration to provide full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). Instead it has chosen to allow congress additional time to resolve the matter through a possible agreement tied to ending the government shutdown.In an order issued on Tuesday (local time), the justices extended a temporary halt on a lower court ruling that had required the administration to release full food benefit payments. The stay remains active until November 13, effectively putting the funding issue on hold without the court examining the legal arguments of either side.The dispute reached the Supreme Court after Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who handles emergency requests from the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals’ jurisdiction, paused a district court-imposed deadline for the payments while the appeals judges reviewed the case.Jackson, one of the court’s liberal justices, approved an emergency request from the administration, even though the matter involves a programme strongly supported by Democrats. In the latest order, Jackson stated she disagreed with the court’s decision to keep the pause in place on full Snap funding.Meanwhile, lawmakers are racing to reach a broader deal. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on Wednesday on a plan to reopen the government through January 30.That proposal includes full-year funding for several federal agencies and services, covering food assistance and benefits for veterans.The department of justice has warned the Supreme Court that judicial intervention risks complicating shutdown negotiations.Government lawyers, according to USA Today, have argued that the lower courts introduced a “massively inappropriate new variable” and disrupted the operation of Snap. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote, ""Congress appears to be on the brink of breaking the deadlock, though that outcome is unsure.”“The district court’s unlawful orders risk upsetting that compromise and throwing into doubt how innumerable critical federal programs will be funded,"" Sauer was further quoted by the agency.The legal fight began when the US district judge John McConnell in Rhode Island ordered the administration to use contingency Snap funds and other available money to ensure full November payments reached states by November 7. The appeals court sided with McConnell, ruling that the danger of leaving tens of millions of Americans without adequate food support outweighed the administration’s objections to using alternative funds.The groups opposing the Trump administration have argued that Snap recipients had “now gone ten days without the help they need to afford food,” warning that millions of Americans, including children, were already going hungry.Almost 42 million people across the country rely on food stamps, which are distributed in phases throughout the month. According to Code for America, an organisation that helps governments improve access to public benefit programmes, about 27 million of them should have received their payments by Monday.US households, according to CNN, on an average get roughly $350 a month to purchase food, but for many families, that money runs out quickly.","The US Supreme Court extended a temporary halt on a lower court ruling that had required the administration to release full food benefit payments.

Banks with bloated cost structures will suffer as savers turn investors; fittest will survive: Kotak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/banks-with-bloated-cost-structures-will-suffer-as-savers-turn-investors-fittest-will-survive-kotak/articleshow/125374936.cms,"CHAMPIONS OF CONTINUITY: Ashok Vaswani Uday Kotak Kotak Mahindra Bank’s MD & CEO (L) with founder

'Over 40 Yrs, Capital Discipline Has Shaped Us... Two Years After I Stepped Down, The Institution Has Managed The Transition & Is Thriving With Leaders Like Ashok Vaswani'

Kotak has been seen as a potential acquirer. The latest speculation is over IDBI Bank. What is your view on opportunities in the financial sector?

Does that forecast sound too dire for the bank?

Have you been too conservative on branch expansion?

You launched 811 in 2017. Is the market ready for digital banking?

Is the market ready to pay for services?

You've partnered foreign firms in several ventures, yet you've also flagged concerns over FDI and the need for guardrails. How do they reconcile?

As someone who chaired a corporate governance panel, how do you see the role of bank boards amid recurring governance issues in private banks?

What role do you see for management in fostering a culture of governance?

Kotak's often accused of retaining excess capital and a cautious approach to risk. Has it led to missed opportunities?

One feature of Kotak has been the lifelong employment of a lot of senior management. Was this by design?

How do you hire at a time when credit decisions are taken by platforms at the back-end and front-end sees lot of churn?

Inflation numbers are out, do you feel RBI is behind the curve in interest rates?

What is the outlook on net interest margin, credit growth?





Two years after stepping down as Kotak Mahindra Bank's CEO, Uday Kotak says he continues to aim to contribute as a key stakeholder and board member to uphold the brand that carries his name. As the group enters its 40th year, Kotak outlined his ambition to build an institution that endures while speaking to TOI in an interview along with the bank's MD & CEO Ashok Vaswani. Vaswani, who earlier served as chief digital officer at the 300-year-old Barclays, said technology is reshaping the industry, and his priority is to evolve with the economy and the sector with a sharper focus on customers and technology. Excerpts:Uday Kotak: We did acquire ING Vysya Bank. On your specific question on IDBI Bank, I'm happy to tell you that I'm blissfully unaware about the situation.My broader view is that the financial sector has structurally changed. Customers now move seamlessly between deposits, mutual funds, equities and other products. Savers are becoming investors, and 'money in motion' is replacing lazy savings. Nobody will keep large sums in current or savings accounts for long; money will shift from a 2.5% savings rate to a 6% liquid fund above a threshold.As this happens, the advantages of regulatory moats will keep diluting.Banks with bloated cost structures will feel the strain as cheap, sticky float migrates to higher-yield options, pushed further by tax incentives that favour investors over depositors. Banks will be forced to go granular because cheap money will come in smaller ticket sizes, while operating costs remain far higher than those of mutual funds - liquid funds run at about 10 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point), equity funds at 50-75bps, while banks operate at about 2.5% between saver and borrower.This is a fundamental structural shift in financial intermediation, and institutions must serve customers across products rather than think in verticals. We see the transition: mutual fund AUM was about 15% of bank deposits in FY20; today it is around 35%, and I expect this to double to roughly 70% in five years, even as deposits grow more slowly. Only the fittest players will adapt and survive.Ashok Vaswani: Kotak's strength is its breadth. We're one of India's broadest financial groups, able to serve a customer across savings, investments, demat, lending and more - all in a seamless, unified way. We own 100% of our 19 subsidiaries, so value created in mutual funds, capital markets, insurance and other businesses stays within the group and compounds.Our model is simple: pick target segments and build a relevant product suite. It works across the franchise - from private banking and Solitaire at the affluent end, to 811 for mass retail, to SME and institutional clients, where our investment bank, treasury, research and corporate teams work as one.On deposits, the challenge is pricing. Affluent customers keep larger balances but move more into mutual funds, while core India customers provide granular, low-cost deposits in smaller tickets but large volumes. We also draw low-cost flows from businesses like domestic custody and from products such as 'active money', which gives FD-like returns with savings-like liquidity. The task is to capture these flows continuously - building the pipes and reservoirs to hold them, even if only for short periods.AV: The top 70-75 cities account for roughly three-fourths of India's deposits, and serving them needs about 3,500 branches. Branches matter because they signal a bank's presence, but they're essentially billboards. I've seen banks worldwide expand far beyond what they need and then spend years shutting those branches. I don't want to repeat that. A network in the 3,400-3,700 range feels right for us.I also believe that if you can watch, learn, shop and transact on your phone, you should be able to bank on it too. If customers still feel the need to visit a branch, that reflects our failure to let them do everything digitally. A digital process doesn't get tired, doesn't make mistakes, operates 24/7 and enforces rules consistently. A physical branch can't match that.UK: Nubank, a branch-less bank, is Brazil's largest company by market value at about $80 billion, and (Warren) Buffett is among its biggest investors. In the UK, Revolut - another digital-only player - has grown to a valuation larger than many traditional banks. In India, Groww didn't exist before 2017 and now accounts for roughly a third of new mutual fund SIPs, all without branches. To me, the future of banking is unmistakably digital.AV: You have to be very careful as to how you define fees and pricing. The minimum balance requirement is in itself a pricing mechanism. Think of it like buffet versus a la carte: you can keep a minimum balance, or choose to pay only for the services you use. Affluent customers take more products with larger ticket sizes, while core India customers use fewer services and prefer paying small fees for what they need. The economics differ, so we offer both and let customers choose.UK: I have always welcomed foreign investments, but I believe clear guardrails are essential. In the 1990s, India's capital markets were at a very early stage and we were a young firm, so partnering with Goldman Sachs helped us learn and build expertise. The same was true in car finance with Ford Credit and later in insurance with Old Mutual.We partnered to acquire best-in-class knowledge, and once we felt confident, we bought back those stakes and built the businesses ourselves. I support India opening up to foreign investment, but rules must be fair and transparent for all players. In recent years, ownership across banks has shifted toward domestic investors as mutual funds and insurers raise their stakes while foreign holdings decline. This reflects a structural change in which the Indian saver has become the investor. It is a positive trend, but one that needs to be nurtured responsibly.UK: I see corporate governance resting on four pillars, each with a distinct role. Management is the first line, responsible for embedding a genuine commitment to governance in day-to-day decisions. The board is the second, and in a leveraged institution like a bank, its oversight of strategy, risk and conduct is critical for long-term stability. The regulator is the third pillar, providing intensive supervision and ensuring compliance across the system. The fourth is shareholders, who must be willing to act when governance slips, including making tough calls on the board or management. Within this framework, I fully agree that boards should own outcomes - they must stay agile, alert and active.AV: I think Kotak has done this well, and it's something we must work hard to preserve. For me, it comes down to culture. People define culture differently, but I see it as a product of what an organisation rewards and what it penalises. When the right behaviours are recognised, you get a culture of openness, transparency and honesty. We take pride in how we govern the organisation, but we're not complacent. It's something we reinforce every day.UK: Over 40 years we grew from a frugal startup that raised Rs 30 lakh through personal and family borrowing. Capital discipline shaped us. We took calculated risks from the start - bill discounting with high contingent leverage, car finance against Citibank by taking inventory risk with Maruti, and backing Godrej's first public issue with a safety net despite our small balance sheet. We survived the 1997 NBFC collapse, when 3,980 of 4,000 failed, because we had raised capital from Goldman and Ford and halved our loan book in time. What looks like excess capital today comes from strong cash-generating businesses and early bets like MCX, bought for Rs 459 crore in 2014 and now worth about Rs 7,500 crore.UK: We built a strong senior team because people like Shanti, Deepak, Jaimin, Narayan, Gaurang all of us started with a mindset of middle-class professionals taking a chance in a young financial sector. There was no grand plan for value or wealth creation - just a shared drive to break the glass and make things happen - kuch karna hain. It was inter-generational... most of us were within a few years of each other in age, joined between the late '80s and mid-90s, and grew together. Two years after I stepped down in Sept 2023, the institution has managed the transition and is thriving, with leaders like Mr Vaswani and a mix of long-time managers and newer hires in technology, marketing and risk. That blend of continuity and renewal is essential if you want an institution to outlast the individuals who built it.AV: I joke that chartered accountants got us here and engineers will take us forward. Skills are shifting across industries, and the people we need now are those who can keep learning, adapt on the job and stay focused on the customer. Front-line roles - relationship managers, private bankers, branch staff and call-centre teams - have different skill needs and naturally different churn, with branches seeing the most. Our goal is to lift the quality of the platforms they work on so that once they experience a strong system, they won't want to move to a weaker one. It's a continuous journey.UK: The fall in wholesale inflation is because of GST cut. We have to go past the event. My sense, and I'm not close enough, is that there could be a likelihood of a 25bps rate cut either in Dec or Feb.AV: I have personal views on rates, but what matters is how the bank handles it. A lower-rate environment hurts us more, and deeper cuts are harder, though we're planning for both outcomes. Q1 was weak as MFI credit costs peaked, rate cuts came late in quarter and margins felt timing impact. Those pressures ease from Q2, and if there are no further cuts, margins should firm up in Q3-Q4 as deposit repricing catches up.","Two years after stepping down as Kotak Mahindra Bank's CEO, Uday Kotak says he continues to aim to contribute as a key stakeholder and board member to uphold the brand that carries his name. Kotak outlined his ambition to build an institution that endures while speaking to TOI in an interview along with the bank's MD & CEO Ashok Vaswani.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125375012,imgsize-97300,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

CLSA has an underperform rating on Jubilant Foodworks with the target price at Rs 477. Analysts said the company missed its sales estimates, which was known. Its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margin was below consensus but slightly improved sequentially, while gross margin improved slightly as it raised prices and packaging charges.

Companies sail through hiring slump on apprenticeships,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/companies-sail-through-hiring-slump-on-apprenticeships/articleshow/125373130.cms,".





BENGALURU: With companies adopting a more cautious approach to hiring, apprenticeships are emerging as a rare window of opportunity for young engineering graduates hoping to break into MNCs. This trend, accelerated during the pandemic, has pushed firms to look beyond traditional talent pools. Unlike internships, apprenticeships target graduates who already have a degree but are yet to secure their first job.While global capability centres (GCCs) typically visit campuses for niche tech skills, a growing share of engineering and tech work is now being handed to apprentices. SA Technologies, which supplies workforce and business solutions to GCCs, hires BTech graduates as apprentices and sees the approach as both cost-efficient and low-risk. ""Instead of hiring and training, we get the opportunity to train and hire them, with no obligation to retain. This lets us mould them the way we want,"" said its COO Aditya Joshi. Apprentices at the firm earn between Rs 20,000 and Rs 35,000 a month - significantly lower than the salaries typically offered to graduates from premier institutes. SA Technologies is in its third cohort, bringing in around two dozen apprentices annually.A recent TeamLease apprenticeship report pegs the national average stipend at Rs 20,000 a month.Vikas Birla, partner at Deloitte India, which focuses on immigration, tax and labour law, said clients are increasingly hiring from smaller towns, often offering remote roles or relocation allowances. The trend, it said, is not purely driven by cost, with apprentices typically earning well above the mandated minimum stipend of Rs 12,300.LatentView Analytics has broadened the model by onboarding statistics graduates. Apprentices undergo a year-long programme combining sandbox projects with theory modules. The company recruits roughly 50 apprentices every year, largely to tap candidates who often get overlooked due to limited access or communication barriers. ""Tier-II and tier-III colleges are often missed during campus placements, and many students don't know how to approach recruiters. We run online assessments just like regular campus hiring and select based on performance,"" the company said. LatentView's apprentices come from places such as Virudhunagar as well as metros like Chennai, and many are placed on data engineering assignments.Hexagon R&D India adopts a similar approach but assigns apprentices directly to live projects. ""They gain hands-on experience on real deliverables under experienced mentors. When they convert to full-time roles, the same teams typically absorb them,"" said its HR director Krupali Ravali. All three companies also run structured soft-skills programmes for their cohorts.According to Nipun Sharma, CEO of TeamLease Apprenticeship, about 75% of the companies hiring apprentices see at least a 40% conversion rate. ""GCCs and MNCs also tap this pool to meet their diversity commitments,"" he said.","Unlike internships, apprenticeships target graduates who already have a degree but are yet to secure their first job.

'US seen as less reliable partner than before': S&P Global Ratings chief economist Paul Gruenwald,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-seen-as-less-reliable-partner-than-before-sp-global-ratings-chief-economist-paul-gruenwald/articleshow/125371511.cms,"H

‘They’ll Love Us Again’: Trump Confirms India-U.S Trade Deal Almost Done – Tariffs To Drop Soon!

Did

economists

overestimate the

impact of US tariffs?

How

do you look at the Indian economy?

How

are investors

looking at India?





Paul Gruenwald, global chief economist at S&P Global Ratings, was in India last week. In an interaction with TOI, he spoke on a range of issues from the state of the US economy, the impact of tariffs on the global economy to India's strong economic growth. Excerpts:Back in April, we were very much focused on tariffs and downside risk to growth. It turns out that the tariff effects were not as bad as we thought. The narrative has really shifted over the last six months or so. Now, we're talking about upside risks from data centres and a capex boom. We definitely still have some policy uncertainty overhang in the US that spills over to the rest of the world. But, the main macro story is a bit better than it was even a couple of months ago.The overestimation was due to three things. We were initially expecting higher tariff rates. The initial rates announced by President Trump were much higher than the final rates. Those came down. The effective tariff rate in the US ended up at about 17%. That was as high as 30% at some point.Number two is there has been very little retaliation. It looks like most countries basically accepted this as a cost of doing business with the US. With the exception of China, which matched the US tit-for-tat the first time. We recently got a 12 month extension between President Trump and President Xi, we haven't really seen the retaliation. There have been quite a number of exemptions. Even though the effective statutory tariff rate is about 17%, the actual tariffs collected by the US so far are closer to 10% effective tariff rate. Most of those so far are being borne by companies, wholesalers, retailers, importers, in terms of margin compression rather than passing them on to consumers. The impact hasn't been as large as we thought. We haven't seen any widespread re-location or re-shoring of manufacturing to the US. It was basically a tax of the US on its own people on imports. It's being shared between businesses and households. We're estimating it's going to be roughly half and half between businesses and consumers on the final incidence. But that pass through has been a bit slower than we thought.India and Brazil are the two economies that have large tariffs that haven't been resolved yet. I'm hearing that there might be an agreement sometime soon, which would take the uncertainty away from India. The US is seen as a less reliable partner than it was before. A lot of countries are kind of hedging their bets and diversifying their trade and their investment exposure, India included. India has an advantage that it's a relatively closed economy and it's not that dependent on the US but I think this is a global trend and part of the move away from this Washington consensus. We don't know exactly where that's going to land, but a number of countries, including India, are taking a hard look at their international relations and managing their risks appropriately.India's the fastest growing major emerging market. It's fair to say the growth baton passed from China to India a few years ago. India has a lot of tailwinds. There is a runway for long and sustained growth. If India can keep up that trajectory due to compounding, we've got a reasonably bright future ahead.A trajectory of 6.5% for India for multiple years is going to be quite respectable. China did a lot of its growth through capital deepening rather than productivity. You can argue that that didn't go particularly well. If India can put together a strong growth of 6% to 7%, there is nothing to be ashamed of. That's quite a good result.","Paul Gruenwald, global chief economist at S&P Global Ratings, was in India last week.

Indian firms shift from AI pilots to scale: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-firms-shift-from-ai-pilots-to-scale-report/articleshow/125371433.cms,"



BENGALURU: Nearly half of Indian enterprises (47%) now have multiple GenAI use cases live, a report by EY-CII report showed. Another 23% are currently in pilot stages, marking a decisive shift from experimentation to scaled execution.The report showed that Indian enterprises are increasingly embedding AI into core business workflows to deliver measurable outcomes. It also highlights rising confidence among business leaders - 76% believe GenAI will have a significant impact on their firms, and 63% say they are ready to leverage it effectively.The report observes that enterprises are shifting away from evaluating AI purely through cost savings and productivity gains, adopting instead a broader five-dimensional ROI model - covering time saved, efficiency improvements, business upside, strategic differentiation, and organisational resilience. Mahesh Makhija, partner and technology consulting leader at EY India, said, ""Nearly half the enterprises already have multiple use cases in production. The focus must now move from building pilots to designing processes where humans and AI agents collaborate seamlessly. Enterprises that prioritise data readiness, model assurance, and responsible AI will shape the competitive advantage of the decade.""Despite this optimism, AI and ML investments remain modest. Over 95% of firms allocate less than 20% of their IT budgets to AI, and only 4% exceed that threshold.","Nearly half of Indian enterprises (47%) now have multiple GenAI use cases live.

US travel update: FAA lifts flight restrictions after government shutdown ends; major airports return to normal Monday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-travel-update-faa-lifts-flight-restrictions-after-government-shutdown-ends-major-airports-return-to-normal-monday/articleshow/125374713.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

according to news agency AP

reported AP





The Federal Aviation Administration will lift all flight-reduction orders at 40 major airports from Monday, allowing airlines to return to normal operations after weeks of shutdown-triggered disruptions.In a joint statement, transportation secretary Sean Duffy and FAA administrator Bryan Bedford said regular schedules can resume from 6 am EST on Monday.The FAA had imposed the unprecedented limits from November 7 due to growing staffing shortages at air-traffic control facilities during what AP described as the country’s longest government shutdown.The cuts initially stood at 4%, rising to 6%, before being reduced to 3% on Friday as staffing improved following the shutdown’s end on November 12,Major hubs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta were among those affected.Cancellations fell to their lowest point this weekend, with aviation analytics firm Cirium showing fewer than 1% of flights cancelled.The FAA said its safety team recommended lifting the order after “detailed reviews of safety trends and the steady decline of staffing-trigger events.” However, it noted reports of carrier non-compliance during the emergency period and said enforcement options were being assessed.The worst disruption came on November 9, when more than 2,900 flights were cut due to the FAA order, controller shortages and severe weather,Controllers, who worked without pay during the 43-day shutdown, had missed two paychecks.According to NBC News, staffing levels have now “stabilised,” enabling the emergency order to end.Staffing-trigger events dropped sharply—from 81 on November 8 to just one on Sunday.Other restrictions, such as limits on visual flight rule approaches and commercial space launches, will also end.Under the original emergency order, reductions were set to climb to 10%, but officials froze them at 6% on Wednesday before scaling them down to 3% on Friday.Duffy said the agency can now “refocus” on controller hiring and building a “state-of-the-art air traffic control system the American people deserve.”","The Federal Aviation Administration will lift all flight-reduction orders at 40 major airports from Monday.

"When will Americans receive $2,000 tariff dividends? Donald Trump speaks out",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/when-will-americans-get-2000-tariff-dividends-donald-trump-speaks-out/articleshow/125371512.cms,"Rebate for families making less than $100,000







President Donald Trump has said Americans could see $2,000 tariff dividend checks in 2026, but no exact date has been set yet, although he hinted at the timeline.The payments are expected to come from revenue raised through tariffs.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said the checks will not arrive in time for the Christmas shopping season. “It will be next year. The tariffs allow us to give a dividend. We’re going to do a dividend and we’re also going to be reducing debt,” he said.The MAGA chief first floated the idea of tariff dividends earlier this month, suggesting that high-income earners would be excluded, though he did not define a specific income threshold. Trump said his Truth Social platform, “A dividend of at $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone. Those against the tariffs are FOOLS!”Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent explained last week that the administration was still discussing income limits. “Well, there are a lot of options here that the president’s talking about a $2,000 rebate and those — that would be for families making less than, say, $100,000,” Bessent told Fox & Friends, later clarifying that no final decision had been made.The plan faces legal hurdles. The US Supreme Court has questioned the legality of Trump’s tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, raising the possibility that some could be struck down.Trump acknowledged that if the Court rejects the tariffs, “Then I’d have to do something else.” The payments would also require congressional approval, with some Republicans sceptical and urging a focus on reducing the federal deficit.Trump’s tariffs, including IEEPA tariffs, have raised around $90 billion since implementation, with all tariffs taking in $195.9 billion in fiscal 2025. Analysts estimate that if the $2,000 dividend were limited to individuals earning under $100,000, the cost would be about $300 billion, according to the New York Post.Trump has repeatedly argued that tariffs are a tool to rebalance trade and support American businesses. Treasury Secretary Bessent said the tariffs are intended to create a “perfect storm” for rebalancing trade rather than merely raising revenue.The GOP leader remains committed to the idea of sending checks to Americans. “We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place,” he posted on Truth Social.","The payments are expected to come from revenue raised through tariffs.

Meet Charlie Javice: Woman who scammed JP Morgan for $175M — but the bank is paying her $142M legal bills,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-charlie-javice-woman-who-scammed-jp-morgan-for-175m-but-the-bank-is-paying-her-142m-legal-bills/articleshow/125369591.cms,"How a startup deal turned into a massive fraud

A conviction that didn’t stop the bills

The controversial expenses

Why JPMorgan cannot simply stop paying





Charlie Javice’s story sounds almost too bizarre to be real: a young fintech founder who tricked JPMorgan into buying her startup for $175 million, ended up convicted of fraud, and is now serving a prison sentence, yet the same company she scammed is still paying more than $142 million for her legal bills, including questionable expenses like luxury hotel upgrades and “cellulite butter. ”Javice founded Frank, a platform advertised as helping students navigate financial aid. When JPMorgan considered acquiring the startup in 2021, she reportedly presented the bank with millions of supposed student user accounts. Prosecutors later revealed that these numbers had been fabricated, with Javice allegedly hiring a data scientist to generate fake profiles to inflate Frank’s value.JPMorgan completed the acquisition believing Frank had more than four million users, only to discover after the deal that the platform had a tiny fraction of that. The bank alerted authorities, and by 2023 Javice was arrested on federal fraud charges.In March 2025, Javice was convicted of multiple fraud counts and sentenced to more than seven years in prison. But here’s where the story takes an unusual twist: despite defrauding the bank, she is still allowed to bill JPMorgan for her legal defence because of an indemnification clause included in the acquisition agreement.This contractual protection, which is common in startup buyouts, requires JPMorgan to cover certain legal costs for former executives of Frank.As a result, the bank has already paid over $142 million in defence expenses for Javice and her former colleague Olivier Amar.The clause itself is a standard feature in mergers, designed to protect executives from being financially ruined by lawsuits connected to their time at the company. In normal situations, it is meant to ensure fairness and prevent frivolous legal targeting after an acquisition. But in this case, it has trapped JPMorgan in a bizarre obligation: they must keep funding the defence of someone who defrauded them.Had the bank conducted even a simple, early-stage verification of Frank’s user data—such as requesting direct access to the platform’s actual customer records or running a basic audit—this entire dispute could have been avoided. Instead, delayed due diligence and overconfidence in the startup’s claims set the stage for a costly legal mess that continues years after the fraud was uncovered.JPMorgan’s frustration has grown as the legal bills have ballooned. The bank claims the expenses submitted include personal items such as cellulite butter, first-class travel upgrades, and hotel luxuries. Its lawyers argue that the billing records contain “extreme abuses,” including claims for work hours that seem physically impossible.Javice’s spokesperson denies that she personally submitted these questionable charges, stating that her legal team is responsible for all billing decisions.Even though Javice has already been convicted, she is now appealing her case, and the indemnification clause means the bank must continue paying her legal fees unless a court orders otherwise.

US-China trade boost: US hopes to finalise China rare earths deal by Thanksgiving; Beijing to suspend export curbs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-china-trade-boost-us-hopes-to-finalise-china-rare-earths-deal-by-thanksgiving-beijing-to-suspend-export-curbs/articleshow/125368312.cms,"



The United States is hoping to finalise its rare earths agreement with China by Thanksgiving, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday, signalling momentum in the negotiations launched after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met in South Korea last month, AFP reported.The tentative deal reached in late October includes a one-year suspension of Chinese export restrictions on critical minerals — a sector where Beijing holds overwhelming dominance in mining and processing, vital for industries ranging from autos and electronics to defence.“We haven't even finished the agreement, which we hope to have done by Thanksgiving,” Bessent said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures. He added, “I am confident… that China will honor their agreements,” referring to commitments made during the Trump–Xi meeting.However, Bessent cautioned that Washington has “lots of levers” if Beijing fails to keep its word.Under the emerging arrangement, rare earths “will flow freely as they did before April 4,” when China imposed new export licence requirements in retaliation for Trump’s sweeping tariffs.As part of the broader understanding reached by both leaders, the United States will roll back some tariffs on Chinese goods, and China will resume large-scale purchases of American soybeans — at least 12 million metric tons this year and 25 million metric tons in 2026.China had halted soybean imports earlier in response to Trump’s tariff actions. “They made pawns out of our great soybean farmers,” Bessent said, adding, “But we believe we have remedied that.”","Deal includes a one-year suspension of Chinese export restrictions on critical minerals.

AI investment: Samsung unveils $310 bn expansion; new chip plant and data centres anchor push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ai-investment-samsung-unveils-310-bn-expansion-new-chip-plant-and-data-centres-anchor-push/articleshow/125363609.cms,"



Samsung has announced a sweeping $310-billion investment plan over five years, aimed largely at expanding semiconductor and AI-enabling infrastructure as the global artificial intelligence boom drives unprecedented demand.The package, unveiled on Sunday, strengthens South Korea’s position as one of the world’s leading chip and AI hubs and builds on the country’s broader strategy to become a top-three global AI power, AFP reported.At the core of the plan is a major semiconductor buildout anchored by Pyeongtaek Plant 5, a new memory-chip facility designed “to meet the needs of memory-chip demands,” Samsung said. Scheduled to begin operations in 2028, the plant is expected to play a “greater strategic role in both the global semiconductor supply chain and South Korea’s domestic chip ecosystem.”Samsung Electronics, already one of the world’s largest memory-chip makers, has seen profits jump more than 30% year-on-year in the third quarter, fuelled by AI-driven demand for high-performance chips. Rival SK hynix, also a key global player, continues to benefit from similar trends.Samsung SDS, the group’s IT and logistics arm, will build two AI data centres in South Jeolla and Gumi. While specific details were not disclosed, the facilities will support large-scale computing workloads needed for AI development and deployment.Samsung Group, a network of cross-linked companies rather than a single holding entity, remains South Korea’s largest chaebol and a dominant force in its tech-driven economy.The investment package includes diversification beyond AI. Samsung SDI, the group’s EV-battery affiliate, is exploring a domestic production line for next-generation batteries, including all-solid-state batteries—considered a crucial technology for the future of electric mobility.Global AI-related spending continues to rise sharply, pushing tech stock valuations higher and prompting comparisons with the dot-com boom. Despite concerns of an asset bubble, governments and companies are accelerating investment. The South Korean government has pledged to triple national AI spending next year, with President Lee Jae Myung vowing to “usher in the AI era” and position the country behind only the United States and China.","Samsung has announced a sweeping $310-billion investment plan over five years.

Ethics scandal: Ex-Fed governor Adriana Kugler broke trading rules; disclosures show repeated policy violations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ethics-scandal-ex-fed-governor-adriana-kugler-broke-trading-rules-disclosures-show-repeated-policy-violations/articleshow/125358814.cms,"File photo: Ex-Fed governor Adriana Kugler (Picture credit: AP)





Former Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned abruptly in August, repeatedly broke the central bank’s strict trading rules before stepping down, according to new disclosures released by US ethics authorities.A report by the US Office of Government Ethics, reviewed after the Federal Reserve referred the matter earlier this year, outlines multiple stock transactions in 2024 that violated Fed policy, as per news agency AP.Kugler listed more than a dozen trades in individual company shares, including Apple, Southwest Airlines, Caterpillar and Fortinet, many of which took place during official blackout periods when financial transactions are prohibited.One of the largest was an Apple stock purchase worth $100,000–$250,000 in April 2024, reported AP.Fed rules, strengthened in 2022 to avoid conflicts of interest, bar senior officials from holding or trading individual stocks, bonds or cryptocurrencies.They require 45 days’ notice and prior approval for any permitted transactions, and forbid trades roughly 10 days before and one day after Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.Kugler’s disclosures also show sales and purchases involving Palo Alto Networks, Cava Group, and Southwest Airlines that occurred within days of Fed policy meetings.She stated repeatedly that the trades were carried out by her husband without her knowledge, and that he did not intend to break any rules.According to officials cited by CNBC, Kugler had earlier sought a waiver from Chair Jerome Powell after acknowledging impermissible holdings, but this request was denied. Concerns about her trades date back to September 2024, with multiple attempts to resolve the violations.Kugler participated in FOMC meetings during her tenure but missed the July meeting due to what the Fed publicly described as a “personal matter,” as per CNBC.Shortly after Powell’s refusal to grant another ethics waiver, she resigned effective August 8.Her financial filings also disclosed over $41,000 worth of pro bono legal services.According to The New York Times, the transactions included repeated purchases and sales of Cava shares around policy meetings, including a buy just a week before the March 19–20 meeting and several trades through mid-May.Southwest Airlines shares were also purchased and later sold a day before the April 30 meeting.The NYT further noted that some improper trades were flagged to the Fed’s watchdog in early 2025, months after compliance discussions in late 2024.Kugler’s delayed ethics filings were also not certified by Fed officials, who previously granted her an extension. Days before the July policy meeting, she sought permission from Powell to trade during the blackout period to exit impermissible holdings — a request that was denied.Kugler, appointed to the Fed board in September 2023, returned to Georgetown University after resigning.Her exit allowed President Donald Trump to appoint Stephen Miran to her seat on the Board of Governors.","Adriana Kugler listed more than a dozen trades in individual company shares, including Apple, Southwest Airlines, Caterpillar and Fortinet.

Energy standoff: US tells Serbia to remove Russian ownership from NIS entirely; Belgrade warns of ‘historic’ decisions ahead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/energy-standoff-us-tells-serbia-to-remove-russian-ownership-from-nis-entirely-belgrade-warns-of-historic-decisions-ahead/articleshow/125352845.cms,"



The United States has told Serbia it will not lift sanctions on the country’s largest oil company, NIS, unless Belgrade ensures a complete withdrawal of Russian ownership, Serbian Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic said on Saturday, calling the weeks ahead “some of the most difficult decisions in our history”.NIS — the Petroleum Industry of Serbia — has been under US sanctions since 2022, imposed as part of Washington’s crackdown on Russia’s energy sector following the invasion of Ukraine, AFP reported. The measures have dealt a severe blow to Serbia, leaving the country perilously close to a winter energy crisis, with its only refinery at risk of shutting down.Handanovic said Belgrade had asked the Trump administration to lift sanctions in exchange for a management restructuring, but US officials insisted on full Russian divestment. “For the first time, the US administration has clearly and unequivocally said it wants a complete change of Russian shareholders,” she told reporters.Washington has given Serbia until February 13 to negotiate a solution.NIS is 45% owned by Gazprom Neft, already sanctioned by Washington. Gazprom transferred its additional 11.3% stake to another Russian entity, Intelligence, in September. The Serbian state holds nearly 30%, with the remainder dispersed among minority shareholders.Despite several postponements, the US Treasury began enforcing sanctions on NIS on October 9, intensifying pressure on Belgrade.The Serbian government is now examining whether it may need to take control of NIS to keep the energy system from collapsing. A special cabinet meeting is scheduled for Sunday.Handanovic acknowledged internal resistance, saying “I know President (Aleksandar) Vucic is against nationalisation, as are many of us in the government,” she said. “We will not let our country be put in danger, but we may face some of the most difficult decisions in our history in the coming days.”She urged Moscow to recognise the seriousness of the moment. “I hope our Russian friends will understand the gravity of the situation and help us overcome it,” she said.Serbia, which relies heavily on Russian natural gas, remains one of the few European nations that has not imposed sanctions on Moscow since the Ukraine war began.","Serbia's largest oil company, NIS, has been under US sanctions since 2022.

Starbucks to Burger King: US brands rethink China strategy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/starbucks-to-burger-king-us-brands-rethink-china-strategy/articleshow/125352133.cms,"Representative image

Chinese brands speed ahead

US firms cut China dependence as tariff woes linger

Could this phase of joint ventures be different?

Can US brands retain a competitive edge?





US multinationals are increasingly aiming to derisk from China amid souring trade ties. Complaints about red tape and favoritism mask a harsher truth: China's market is brutally competitive and local rivals are winning.When Starbucks opened its first store in Beijing in 1999, it wasn't just selling coffee; it was selling Western aspirations to China's rising middle class. The Seattle-based giant expanded rapidly to dominate China’s premium coffee scene.That early-mover advantage has, however, since eroded. Chinese competitors like Luckin Coffee and Manner have overtaken Starbucks in store count and captured market share, thanks to aggressive pricing, mobile integration and a sharper understanding of Chinese consumer habits. Luckin drives more than 90% of sales via its app, while Starbucks still relies on in-store traffic.Thereported recently that Starbucks' China revenues plunged nearly 19% from 2021 to 2024 to $3 billion (€2.58 billion). The coffee retailer's market share over the past five years has fallen to 14% (2024) from 34%, according to Euromonitor International.With such headwinds affecting its second-biggest market, Starbucks announced this month it would sell a stake in its China operations to a Hong Kong-based private equity firm.The $4 billion deal with Boyu Capital creates a joint venture (JV) in which Starbucks retains 40%.In a parallel move, Burger King announced a new JV with a Beijing-based private equity partner this week, selling a majority stake for $350 million in investment to expand from 1,250 to over 4,000 stores by 2035.It's not just US multinationals. French sports retailer Decathlon is planning to sell about 30% of its China business, a stake valued at €1 billion ($1.16 billion) to €1.5 billion, as it faces pressure from local rivals.For retailers from the United States, the problem is not only slowing demand but the speed and sophistication of local rivals, who launch new products faster and price more aggressively. They also integrate seamlessly into China’s digital ecosystem through mobile platforms like WeChat and Alipay.""A lot of these global names have started to lose their brand power within China,"" Chenyi Lin, an affiliate professor specializing in digital transformation at Insead business school, told DW. ""The new name of the game is agility and adaptability.""Clues to the hyper‑competitive nature of China's consumer market include its 129 electric-vehicle brands, more than 50,000 coffee chains and over 450,000 bubble tea outlets nationwide.Local champions have not only saturated the mass market but are now moving upmarket, offering premium products at competitive prices. Even the extent of competition is fierce, with domestic players challenging foreign firms across food, fashion, electronics and mobility.Jason Yu, Managing Director of CTR Market Research, says Chinese players used to copy from the big multinationals but are now sometimes surpassing them.""In the coffee market, for example, local chains are launching new products much faster, sometimes in a matter of weeks, while Starbucks has to wait months for global approval,"" Yu told DW.Analysts like Yu and Lin expect the JV trend to intensify, as Chinese brands expand globally while continuing to erode the dominance of Western names at home.JVs are just one derisking strategy. Several US manufacturers recalibrated their global supply chains after the COVID-19 pandemic to cut reliance on China due to an over‑reliance on a single source for manufacturing and parts. Apple shifted some of its iPhone production to India, while Nike expanded manufacturing in lower-cost markets in Southeast Asia.Amid uneven growth, US business confidence in China has also hit a historic low, with only 41% of firms optimistic about the next five years, according to industry lobby group AmCham Shanghai's September 2025 survey.Yet rather than exit, Starbucks and Burger King's JVs with private-equity partners should enable them to gain speed, capital and digital integration in a market where local brands now set the pace.""[Chinese JV partners] have the local knowledge, connections and resources to help the multinational brand to be more interconnected with the local ecosystem rather than compete on their own,"" said Yu.Historically, JVs were the standard way for foreign companies to enter China, mandated by law in the 1990s. However, these arrangements can be risky due to uneven regulatory enforcement, limited control over operations and potential intellectual property exposure.Many US firms have had bitter experiences, facing diluted control, slower decision‑making and conflicts with local partners. By the 2000s, many foreign brands in China abandoned them, preferring wholly owned operations. Full foreign ownership in retail has only been allowed since 2022.According to AmCham China, US corporations remain skeptical of JVs. Trade tensions and geopolitics add another layer of uncertainty, the business body said in a recent report. US–China tariffs remain in place on billions of dollars of goods, while rising frictions over Taiwan and other regional issues have also heightened boardroom anxiety.Yu told DW that joint ventures used to be seen as a necessary evil in China, but the latest deals are ""very different"" as they are less about legal necessity and more about strategic advantage.""In a market where Chinese competitors launch new products in weeks and integrate seamlessly into digital platforms, agility is everything. Without these partnerships, many US retailers would struggle to keep pace,"" he said.The greatest risk for US retailers is not competition but leaving China altogether. Walking away from the world’s largest consumer market would mean surrendering long‑term growth. Exiting may look like derisking, but it also risks irrelevance.“If you leave China, you don't just lose sales today — you lose the ability to shape the habits of tomorrow's consumers,"" Lin told DW. ""Once those habits are set by local brands, it is almost impossible for foreign companies to win them back.""",US multinationals are increasingly aiming to derisk from China amid souring trade ties.

USPS financial loss: Postal Service flags $9 bn deficit; agency pushes price hikes and policy fixes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/usps-financial-loss-postal-service-flags-9-bn-deficit-agency-pushes-price-hikes-and-policy-fixes/articleshow/125351668.cms,"



The US Postal Service (USPS) has sought sweeping administrative and legislative changes after reporting a $9 billion annual loss, a marginal improvement from the $9.5 billion deficit posted last year, Reuters reported.New Postmaster General David Steiner said the agency continues to face a “significant systemic annual revenue and cost imbalance” and must accelerate efficiency measures, Reuters reported. “To correct our financial imbalances, we must explore new revenue opportunities and public policy changes to improve our business model,” he said.USPS has lost over $100 billion since 2007, even after rounds of restructuring and a $50 billion financial package approved by Congress in 2022. The agency is now seeking reforms that include changes to retiree pension funding rules, diversification of pension assets, a higher statutory borrowing limit and updates to workers’ compensation processes.Alongside reform demands, USPS has proposed new price increases across several products — excluding first-class mail. The plan includes a 6.6% hike for Priority Mail, 5.1% for Priority Mail Express, 7.8% for USPS Ground Advantage, and 6% for Parcel Select.The cost of a first-class stamp rose to 78 cents this year from 73 cents, marking a 46% increase since 2019.In February, President Donald Trump called USPS a “tremendous loser for this country” and said he was considering merging it with the Commerce Department — a move Democrats said would violate federal law.Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy resigned in March under White House pressure after nearly five years of sweeping operational changes that halved projected 10-year losses from $160 billion to $80 billion.Mail volumes dropped 5% in the year ended September 30 to the lowest level since 1967, underscoring the structural decline in traditional postal services.USPS, which employs 635,000 people, cut 10,000 positions this year through a voluntary retirement programme as part of its cost-reduction efforts.","USPS has lost over $100 billion since 2007, even after rounds of restructuring and a $50 billion financial package approved by Congress in 2022.

AI dashcams for Hawaii

Street sweeper cameras in San Jose

Texas scans 250,000 lane miles





America’s ageing and under-maintained roads are pushing cities and states to adopt artificial intelligence tools that can spot hazards, flag repairs and prioritise fixes in real time — a shift gaining pace amid rising traffic deaths and stretched public works budgets.From Hawaii and Texas to San Jose, local governments are deploying AI-powered dashcams, vehicle-mounted cameras and mobile-based analytics to detect potholes, damaged guardrails, obscured signs and risky driving patterns, replacing manual inspections that can take months, according to AP.Hawaii is giving away 1,000 AI-enabled dashboard cameras under its “Eyes on the Road” initiative, aimed at reversing a jump in traffic deaths. The technology automatically identifies damaged guardrails, missing road signs and worn-out pavement markings, triggering alerts for crews to respond.“This is not something where it’s looked at once a month and then they sit down and figure out where they’re going to put their vans,” said Richard Browning of Nextbase, which developed the system, quoted AP.Roger Chen of the University of Hawaii, who is helping run the programme, said the state’s geography and older infrastructure make maintenance far more challenging.“Equipment has to be shipped to the island… it’s not an easy problem,” he said.Guardrail failures have been a concern for Hawaii. The state last year settled a $3.9 million lawsuit after a driver died in 2020 when his vehicle hit a guardrail that had remained unrepaired for 18 months.By October, Hawaii had recorded its 106th traffic fatality of 2025 — already above the previous year’s total.San Jose is expanding its pilot that uses cameras mounted on street sweepers and parking enforcement vehicles. City staff say the system correctly identified potholes 97% of the time.Mayor Matt Mahan said the project’s success depends on cities contributing data to a shared repository. “We could wait five years for that to happen here, or maybe we have it at our fingertips,” he said.San Jose helped create the GovAI Coalition, launched publicly in 2024, with members from California, Minnesota, Oregon, Texas, Washington and the state of Colorado.Texas, which has more roadway miles than the next two US states combined, is using AI tools to assess street signs, analyse congestion and scan its network.Jim Markham of the Texas Department of Transportation said AI helped flag outdated signs across 250,000 lane miles. “Having AI that can go through and screen for that is a force multiplier,” he said.The state is also using systems like StreetVision, a mobile-based tool that identifies dangerous driving patterns. In one case, data flagged sudden braking on a Washington, D.C. roadway — caused by a bush blocking a stop sign.“That brought me to an infrastructure problem, and the solution… was a pair of garden shears,” said Ryan McMahon of Cambridge Mobile Telematics.Building for autonomous vehiclesExperts say these developments are early steps towards preparing infrastructure for a future where human-driven and autonomous vehicles share the road.Mark Pittman, CEO of Blyncsy, which works on the Hawaii dashcam programme, said most new vehicles will soon come with built-in cameras. “They're now building infrastructure for humans and automated drivers alike, and they need to start bridging that divide,” he said.","Hawaii is giving away 1,000 AI-enabled dashboard cameras under its “Eyes on the Road’ initiative.

Walmart leadership change: CEO Doug McMillon to step down next year — Who will succeed him?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/walmart-leadership-change-ceo-doug-mcmillon-to-step-down-next-year-who-will-succeed-him/articleshow/125342505.cms,"McMillon's time at Walmart





Walmart is set to undergo a major leadership change, as the chief executive, Doug McMillon, will retire next year, after spending a little over 10 years at the position.The company has named John Furner, currently CEO and president of Walmart’s US operations, as his successor. Furner will assume the top job on February 1, 2026. Both men have spent decades rising through Walmart’s ranks in various senior positions.The announcement comes as the retail sector grapples with a difficult economic landscape, with tariffs and subdued consumer sentiment hurting margins across the industry. Even so, Walmart has maintained a strong position under McMillon, using its scale in supply chains and grocery to keep prices low, according to CNN.These strengths have helped the company draw customers across income brackets, including households earning more than $100,000 a year, the group it recently identified as its fastest-growing segment.McMillon’s time as CEO coincided with Walmart’s transformation into a far more competitive ecommerce player. He led the retailer’s growth online, expanded Walmart+, and helped position the company as a credible alternative to Amazon.He also served a two-year term as chairman of the Business Roundtable, representing nearly 200 major US companies in Washington.His leadership saw Walmart introduce major policy changes as well.In 2019, the company halted sales of handgun ammunition and ammunition used in military-style assault weapons, while also requesting that customers stop openly carrying firearms in its stores. The shift followed a mass shooting at a Walmart outlet in El Paso, Texas, in which 22 people were killed. McMillon publicly criticised the 6 January attack on the US Capitol and regularly opposed President Donald Trump’s tariffs.However, some initiatives during his tenure fell short of expectations.Walmart’s $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com did not deliver the growth the company sought and was eventually shut down and absorbed into Walmart.com. Efforts to push into upscale fashion, including Bonobos, also struggled to gain traction.McMillon’s career at Walmart began as a store associate, leading to positions at Sam’s Club and Walmart’s international business before his promotion to CEO in 2014. Since then, Walmart’s share price has increased by 300%. “Our family and Board have stated many times that Doug was uniquely qualified to be CEO at the necessary time for Walmart,” said Greg Penner, chairman of Walmart Inc., in a press release.“Doug led a comprehensive transformation by investing in our associates, advancing our digital and eCommerce capabilities, and modernizing our supply chain, resulting in sustained, robust financial performance,” CNN cited the release.Furner, who has overseen Walmart US’ 4,600 stores since 2019, also began at the company as an hourly associate in 1993. His background includes roles at Sam’s Club and Walmart China, and the company credited his contributions in “associate development, digital innovation, and operational excellence.”According to Walmart, McMillon will remain on the board until June next year and will continue advising Furner through the 2027 fiscal year. The retailer also said it will announce a new leader for its US operations soon.","Doug McMillon, Walmart's CEO since 2014, will retire next year.

Warren Buffett's market move: Berkshire takes $4.3 billion stake in Google parent Alphabet; scales back Apple holding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffetts-market-move-berkshire-takes-4-3-billion-stake-in-google-parent-alphabet-scales-back-apple-holding/articleshow/125341466.cms,"Further reductions in Bank of America





Berkshire Hathaway has unveiled a new multibillion-dollar investment in Alphabet while continuing to scale back its long-running position in Apple, marking the final update of its portfolio before Warren Buffett steps down after 60 years as the chief executive.In a filing submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, the company reported owning 17.85 million shares of Alphabet as of September 30, an investment worth $4.3 billion. During the same quarter, Berkshire reduced its Apple stake from 280 million shares to 238.2 million, as per a Reuters report. Over the years, it has sold nearly three-quarters of the more than 900 million Apple shares it once held.Apple, however, still represented Berkshire’s largest holding at $60.7 billion.The filing detailed the conglomerate’s US-listed equity positions as of the end of September, which together made up most of its $283.2 billion stock portfolio.Alphabet’s arrival as Berkshire’s tenth-largest US holding stood out because of Buffett’s long-held preference for value-focused investments and his general reluctance toward technology companies.He has previously described Apple, the maker of the iPhone, as more of a consumer products business.It was not disclosed whether Buffett, investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, or CEO-designate Greg Abel made the individual stock selections, though Buffett is usually responsible for larger transactions. At Berkshire’s 2019 shareholder meeting, Buffett and the late Charlie Munger acknowledged missing the opportunity to buy into Google earlier.Buffett pointed to similarities between Google’s advertising model and what worked for Berkshire’s Geico business. “We screwed up,” Munger said. “He’s saying we blew it,” Buffett replied.Alphabet shares rose 1.7% in after-hours trading, a reaction that often follows Berkshire’s disclosure of new stakes, which many investors treat as a sign of confidence.The quarterly update also showed that Berkshire bought $6.4 billion worth of stocks and sold $12.5 billion between July and September, marking its twelfth consecutive quarter as a net seller. The company’s cash holdings climbed to a record $381.7 billion. A significant portion of the sales is believed to have come from Apple.Berkshire also reduced its stake in Bank of America by 6%, extending a selling trend that began in the third quarter of last year. The bank remains the conglomerate’s third-largest stock position. The update further confirmed that Berkshire exited its holding in homebuilder DR Horton, while increasing its stakes in several other companies including Chubb and Domino’s Pizza, Reuters reported.The growing cash reserves come as Buffett prepares to hand leadership of Berkshire’s $1.1 trillion empire to Abel on 1 January. Analysts have noted that Berkshire has been cautious on valuations, avoiding any major acquisition for nearly a decade and not buying back its own shares for more than a year.Beyond its stock market investments, Berkshire controls close to 200 businesses, including the BNSF railway, energy and manufacturing companies, and well-known retail brands such as Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and See’s Candies.","Berkshire Hathaway has unveiled a new multibillion-dollar investment in Alphabet while continuing to scale back its long-running position in Apple.

Switzerland has announced a $200 billion investment plan in the US through 2028, coinciding with a breakthrough agreement that will sharply cut US tariffs on most Swiss goods. The deal lowers duties from 39% - the highest imposed on any Western economy - to 15%, aligning Swiss exporters with the tariff regime applied to the European Union, AP reported.Economy Minister Guy Parmelin said in Bern that the agreement was made possible by “new momentum generated by the commitment of the American president” and is expected to take effect in the coming weeks. The White House confirmed the development and said companies from Switzerland and Liechtenstein would account for $67 billion of the planned investment in 2026.A White House fact sheet said the proposed investments would create “thousands of well-paying American jobs across all 50 states” in sectors including pharmaceuticals, machinery, medical devices, aerospace, construction, advanced manufacturing, gold refining and energy infrastructure.The US, which ran a goods trade deficit of more than $38 billion with Switzerland last year, said the agreement “will put us on a path to eliminate that deficit by 2028.” US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC that Switzerland would shift some manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, gold smelting and railway equipment to the United States.The tariff rollback follows months of tension after Washington first raised duties on Swiss products to 31% in April as part of its “Liberation Day” tariff actions and then to 39% on July 31.The spike prompted a sustained diplomatic and corporate effort from Bern, which intensified over the past month.Switzerland, already among the largest foreign investors in the US, said the $200 billion plan would be driven by private-sector commitments coordinated under what Parmelin described as “Team Switzerland”. It is not yet clear how much of the investment is new; Roche had earlier announced a $50 billion US investment during the tariff escalation.Several categories of Swiss exports — including pharmaceuticals, chemicals, gold and semiconductor-related goods — had been exempted from the highest tariff slab, but other sectors such as industrial machinery, watches, coffee and cheese remained affected. Parmelin said some tariffs deemed “important”, including in aviation, would be suspended under the new deal, while Switzerland would continue negotiations to ease duties in remaining sectors.The agreement follows an intensive diplomatic campaign, with delegations to Washington led by Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter and Parmelin. Last week, senior executives from Rolex, gold refiner MKS Pamp and luxury group Richemont met President Donald Trump at the Oval Office to press Bern’s case.",Switzerland has announced a $200 billion investment plan in the US through 2028.

US markets today: Wall Street stays volatile as AI stocks whipsaw; global sell-off deepens across Europe and Asia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-markets-today-wall-street-logs-second-sharp-fall-as-ai-favourites-tumble-global-indices-mirror-tech-led-slump/articleshow/125330407.cms,"



US stock market stayed volatile on Friday, extending the turbulence from the previous session as major AI-linked stocks swung sharply and triggered another day of unsettled trading across Wall Street.The S&P 500 slipped 0.5% after recovering part of an early 1.3% slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 485 points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq composite edged 0.4% lower by 10 a.m. Eastern time, showing little stability after Thursday’s sell-off.AI stocks remained the focal point. Nvidia — which has become the market’s most influential beneficiary of the AI boom — moved from a steep early loss to a small gain of 0.1%, pulling broader indices with it. The company’s stock, which has more than doubled in four of the last five years, is still within sight of records that helped push the S&P 500 to all-time highs late last month, AP reported.“Occasional market drops are the price of the ticket for the ride,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, as traders continued to debate the sustainability of AI-driven valuations. Nvidia’s earnings next week are now seen as critical, with analysts warning that any shortfall could trigger deeper declines because the stock exerts the single largest influence on the S&P 500.Outside technology, Walmart fell 1.5% after announcing that CEO Doug McMillon will retire in January, a move that surprised investors given his role in expanding the retailer’s digital operations.Market sentiment was also shaped by interest-rate uncertainty. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.11%, unchanged from late Thursday, as traders reassessed the likelihood of another Federal Reserve rate cut in December. While the Fed has lowered rates twice this year, officials have signalled caution due to inflation remaining above the 2% target and delays in economic data caused by the U.S. government shutdown.Bitcoin, which often reacts to shifts in rate expectations, briefly slipped below $95,000 before recovering slightly, far below the nearly $125,000 level seen in October. Gold dropped nearly 3% as higher-rate worries dampened demand for non-yielding assets.Global markets also mirrored Wall Street’s weakness. South Korea’s Kospi tumbled 3.8%, London’s FTSE 100 lost 1.5%, and indices across Europe and Asia traded sharply lower. The sell-off extended pressure on equities from Seoul to Shanghai, where markets fell amid broader caution and sector-specific concerns.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.5% after recovering part of an early 1.3% slide.

1.14 lakh startups generate more than 12 lakh jobs in India: Finance ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/trend-tracking/1-14-lakh-startups-generate-more-than-12-lakh-jobs-in-india-finance-ministry/articleshow/107262154.cms,"Finance Ministry

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024. With generative AI (GenAI) acceleration, 70 per cent of start-up founders are embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in their solutions.As funding becomes scarce for the Indian startup ecosystem in general, the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given a new lease of life to entrepreneurs and founders in the country, as the Centre extends support to the sector.","The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Is it better to stay on rent or get your own place? It’s complicated, to borrow a phrase from romantic conundrums. So, should one spend a big sum on a house property – especially with the help of a home loan – given that prices are higher and the capital appreciation in many towns is not as significant as it once was? Isn’t living on rent, perhaps closer to the office, easier? On the other hand, an investment in a house property is a secured and tangible investment. Plus, a house is not just four walls; there is a lot of emotion attached to it. Let’s look at it from the tax perspective…One of the biggest advantages of renting a house from a tax perspective is the exemption for house rent allowance (HRA), a tax-efficient salary component. If HRA is not a part of your salary package — for example if you are self-employed or a consultant— you can avail deduction of up to 5,000 a month from gross taxableincome, under the old tax regime. The HRA exemption is not available to taxpayers who opt for the new tax regime. The exemption is on the lowest of the following:● Rent paid less 10% of salary (basic salary and dearness allowance)● 50% of salary if the house is in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata or Chennai, or 40% of salary in other cities● Actual HRA received● Rent may be lower than a home loan EMI● More choice of location and type● Easy to relocate to another area of city● Tax benefits are available (under old tax regime)● Rent, however high, does not go towards creating an asset● Rents usually increase every year, leading to higher cash outflow● No or limited scope of making structural changes● One may have to vacate on short noticeTax benefits are only available under the old tax regime. If you take a home loan to buy a house property, the EMI is typically made up of two parts: one part goes towards the principal (the amount you took as loan) and the other towards the interest (the cost of servicing the loan).Deduction is available under the overall 1.5 lakh limit under Section 80C under the old tax regime. Principal repayment, stamp duty, registration fee and other expenses related to transfer of the house property qualify for the deduction, under this limit.Three situations apply: the house is self-occupied, vacant or rented out. For a self-occupied house property, there is deduction available on the interest paid on home loan up to 2 lakh per annum under the old tax regime. This can be set off against any other income. The same rules apply even if the house is vacant. If you have rented out the house, you can claim deduction for not only the interest paid on the home loan, but also municipal taxes paid and a standard deduction of 30% of the rental income.If your house is a self-occupied property bought using a home loan, it means you do not earn any rental income from it. Therefore, interest paid on the home loan will result in a loss. Total loss up to 2 lakh from house property (either self-occupied or letout) can be adjusted in a financial year against any other head of income (such as salary or income from other sources). Loss exceeding 2 lakh can be carried forward for eight subsequent assessment years but can be setoff only against ‘Income from house property’.The concept of notional rent applies when an individual owns three houses or more. In such cases, two house properties are considered self-occupied (without any conditions as per the 2025 Budget proposals) and the remaining are treated as ‘deemed let-out’, thus attracting notional rent. This is based on the expected market rent and becomes a taxable income.● A house is an asset and EMIs go towards creating this asset● Substantial tax benefits on home loans● Heavy upfront costs such as down payment and registration, followed by property taxes and repairs● House properties are illiquid as they cannot be sold quickly● Property prices see fluctuations and may not fetch expected returns● EMIs have to be paid regularly, mostly irrespective of situations like loss of income","One of the biggest advantages of renting a house from a tax perspective is the exemption for house rent allowance (HRA), a tax-efficient salary component. If HRA is not a part of your salary package, you can avail deduction of up to 5,000 a month from gross taxableincome.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117857373,imgsize-147566,width-400,resizemode-4/117857373.jpg"

NEW DELHI: After giving major tax relief to middle class salaried individuals in Union Budget 2025 , finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the significant tax relief provided by the Modi government has put more more money in people's hands compared to the tax structure in 2014 under the previous Congress-led government. The reforms, aimed at putting more money back into taxpayers' hands, have resulted in substantial savings across different income brackets, Sitharaman said.""If you compare what we have done today with what was done in 2014 under the Congress government, the change in rates has also benefited people earning Rs 24 lakh. Now they have Rs 2.6 lakh more than under the old system,"" Sitharaman said.""So, it is not just those earning up to Rs 12 lakh who are benefited, because they do not have to pay any tax due to exemptions,"" the minister added.Adding to this, finance secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said, ""Earlier, it (rebate) was Rs 2.2 lakh, and in 2014, it became Rs 2.5 lakh; in 2019, it became Rs 5 lakh. Later, it was raised to Rs 7 lakh and now it being raised to Rs 12 lakh. The government feels that on the average Rs 1 lakh per month (income), you need not pay tax.""Speaking on the changes, officials emphasised that middle-class and higher-income earners alike are benefitting from the lower tax rates and increased rebates. The government provided a comparative breakdown:The government stressed that the benefits extend beyond just those earning up to Rs 12 lakh, where tax rebates have been introduced.Even those earning Rs 24 lakh per year will see a reduction in their tax liability, ensuring a more progressive and taxpayer-friendly system.Additionally, the Finance Ministry provided a comparison with the prevailing 2024 tax rates and the newly proposed structure:Finance Secretary emphasised that these tax cuts represent a ""substantial amount being put back into the hands of people who deserve it."" He also noted that not only have rebates been introduced, but the overall tax rates have been lowered, benefiting a broader segment of taxpayers.With these changes, the government has reinforced its commitment to reducing the tax burden, boosting disposable income, and supporting economic growth, ensuring that taxpayers retain a greater share of their earnings.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the significant tax relief provided by the Modi government has put more more money in people's hands.

Typically this happens if the supplier has made mistakes in the original invoice, such as declaring a value higher than the value of goods or services actually provided or has mentioned an incorrect higher GST rate. A credit note is also issued when goods are returned by the buyer.Rohit Jain, deputy managing partner, at Economic Laws Practice explains, ""There exists a possibility that the recipient (buyer) could have taken input tax credit (ITC) based on the original invoice and subsequently, the supplier issues a credit note and claims adjustment (refund). The Budget proposes that it is now necessary for the supplier to ensure that the recipient reverses ITC before such adjustment is claimed.""The amendment appears to have been introduced to prevent revenue leakage . It will prevent scenarios where the supplier claims a reduction in its GST liability, owing to the credit note, but the buyer continues to avail of the corresponding ITC. This results in a double tax benefit with an adverse impact on GST collection.Jain points out that proposed amendment is based on recommendations of the GST Council. As it places an additional burden on suppliers, there exists a possibility that the amendment may be challenged in courts on the premise that suppliers will have to bear consequences of the recipient's non-compliance, despite having no control over the recipient's actions.",A supplier of goods or services can issue a credit note to the buyer in several instances.

Many see Malhotra holding a different view from his predecessor and feel the recent depreciation of the rupee as a sign that the regulator is allowing the currency to settle lower in line with other markets.According to Aurodeep Nandi, India economist at Nomura, the Budget should provide greater room for RBI to begin lowering its policy rate at the Feb MPC meeting. ""The fiscal wizardry of the numbers has been the ability to cut fiscal deficit from 4.8% of GDP in FY25 to 4.4% in FY26, while announcing income tax concessions and maintaining a decent public investment outlay. Much of this has been possible due to a bonanza of RBI dividends and expectations of healthy income tax collections,"" he said.Rahul Bajoria, economist at Bank of America Securities, said, ""After a period of tackling conflicting objectives, RBI is finally seeing some cohesion in economic data around growth and inflation, providing a base for policy easing.

Changes sought in transfer pricing assessment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/changes-sought-in-transfer-pricing-assessment/articleshow/117872636.cms,"MUMBAI: Budget 2025 has proposed changes in the transfer pricing (TP) assessment process to reduce compliance burdens for businesses and streamline tax administration. TP assessments can sometimes result in long-drawn litigation.At present, companies involved in international or specified domestic transactions between related parties must conduct a transfer pricing review every year to determine the Arm's Length Price (ALP) - the fair market value of such transactions. However, authorities have noted that many businesses engage in similar transactions year after year with little variation in terms of partners, transaction volume, or pricing. As a result, the same analysis is repeated annually, creating unnecessary paperwork for businesses and tax officials.To address this, the budget proposes a block assessment mechanism . Once the ALP is determined for a particular year, it will automatically apply to similar transactions for the next two years. Business entities wishing to opt for the block assessment must submit a request and the transfer pricing officer will within a month decide on the validity of the request.A new provision will allow tax authorities to adjust a company's income for the two subsequent years based on the previously determined ALP. The revised income calculations must be completed within a specified time frame.While transfer pricing experts and industry representatives have welcomed the move, they point out the need to read between the lines.Mitesh Jain, partner at the law firm of Economic Laws Practice said, while the amendment appears to be a welcome initiative, implementation of the same may be a 'double-edged sword' for taxpayers. Once the taxpayer has opted for such ALP determination, the same will be binding for next two years. Thus, if the transfer pricing officer and assessing officer makes any TP adjustments in the first year, these will apply the subsequent two years even if the cases for the two years are not selected for scrutiny or referred to TPO.""Aayush Nagpal, tax partner at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, added, ""Introduction of this legislation suggests relief from year-on-year litigation, however, the rules may through light on the unanswered questions including the approach of the transfer pricing officer to resolve the matters, scope of appeal with the taxpayers, fate of new transactions along with the process for corporate tax assessment matters in the second or third year under the block. Govt has introduced these provisions in line with the bigger objective of ease of doing business and enhancing tax certainty, so it is expected that the rules will clear any ambiguity.""","At present, companies involved in international or specified domestic transactions must conduct a transfer pricing review every year to determine the fair market value of such transactions.

At present, perquisites (other than those exempt) are part of salary income and are subject to tax at the applicable slab rates. The details, in this regard, will be announced later.Supreme Court advocate Deepak Joshi said, ""A rule making power in favour of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has been prescribed. Instead of a monetary threshold built in the statute itself, CBDT can exercise the power to increase the threshold and benefit employees."" A notification by the CBDT, which may follow at a later date, will show the extent to which employees will stand to benefit.At present, the value of any benefit or amenity provided by any employer to an employee is not treated as a perquisite if the salary income of such employee is below Rs 50,000. Secondly, any expenditure incurred by the employer for overseas treatment of the employee or his/her family members is not a taxable perquisite if the gross total income of such employee is less than Rs 2 lakh. A revision in the thresholds in both the above instances, has been indicated in Budget 2025.Rahul Charkha, partner at Economic Laws Practice said, ""The proposed widening of the threshold limits is a welcome move from the taxpayers' perspective as these threshold limits were virtually insignificant from a salaried employee's perspective.

'Sending signal tariffs in India are not very high': CBIC chief Sanjay Kumar Agarwal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sending-signal-tariffs-in-india-are-not-very-high-cbic-chief-sanjay-kumar-agarwal/articleshow/117872630.cms,"The Budget announced a rationalisation of tariff structure for industrial goods. What is the message?

How does India's tariff structure compare with rest of the world after this rationalisation exercise?

How confident are you about meeting revenue numbers this year?

What is the progress on simplification of GST rates?

There is a lot of unease about the

GST rate structure

. Do you expect some movement on this?

The rationalisation of tariff structure has tried to address the view that rates are very high in India. In an interview to TOI, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) chairman Sanjay Kumar Agarwal talks about the changes undertaken in the Budget and their long-term impact: Excerpts:In the July 24 Budget, FM announced that a comprehensive review of custom duty structure will be undertaken. And, the structure will be rationalised. The objective is we have to simplify the rate structure. We have to ensure the competitiveness of Indian industry. We will have to ensure that if certain higher tariff protection is to be provided to specific sectors for a short duration, that is to be done. And, ease of doing business was also one of the objectives. So, when we conducted this exercise, we found that we can eliminate seven more rates. Earlier in 2024 Budget, we already eliminated seven tariff rates. We identified the rates, which need to be kept intact and which can be eliminated. Generally, there is a view that in India tariff rates are very high. But, if we look into the items, which are placed in these rates, are very few.By doing this exercise, the average customs rate in India, which earlier was calculated as 11.65%, has come down to 10.66% now. So, it is nearer to the rates in Asean countries. So, optics about tariff structure of India has improved. Secondly, one more exercise has been done. We found that on 82 tariff lines there was cess as well as surcharge. So, we exempted the surcharge on these 82 tariff lines and wherever the effective rate was lower than the tariff rate. So, broadly the exercise has been done in this manner largely to improve the optics about the tariff structure in the country. We are sending a signal to the world that in India, tariffs are not very high. For time being, there is a cess, which has been imposed for a particular purpose, which is agriculture and infrastructure development cess. But, that cess can always be lowered.Our revised estimates have been lowered as compared to the Budget on July 24. It was Rs 16.19 lakh crore. Now, it has been revised downwards to Rs 16.02 lakh crore. We are confident that we will achieve the revised estimates, which have been fixed for indirect taxes.The Group of Ministers (GoM) is yet to submit the report. It is far more difficult to build a consensus in GST. In customs matters, it is to be decided by the Centre but in GST, it is to be the collective consent of the Centre and the states. So, it is a more complex exercise as far as GST is concerned. But, GoM will be going into all aspects on slabs, number of slabs, how the items are placed, what is to be done to reduce the litigation and how the revenues to be raised. All these aspects have to be looked into by GoM and in due course they will submit their reports.Yes. The GoM should address the rate structure, especially on food items. The maximum number of disputes are related to food items and there is a need to have a simplified GST rate structure for food items.","The rationalisation of tariff structure has tried to address the view that rates are very high in India.

Old vs new vs newer: When a regime change makes sense,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/old-vs-new-vs-newer-when-a-regime-change-makes-sense/articleshow/117842727.cms,"The new tax regime proposed in Budget - with a tax rebate of Rs 60,000 on income up to Rs 12 lakh (and Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried people) - leaves the old tax regime , with three slabs of 5%, 20%, an 30%, with little appeal, even with all the deductions against investments in tax savings scheme from gross income.The finance ministry has long endeavoured to delink savings schemes from tax liability so that taxpayers can make an independent and informed choice, solely to maximise their benefits.For income up to Rs 12 lakh (Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried people), new tax regime is better than the old even if one is availing maximum possible deductions of Rs 5,75,000 and 30% of salary as house rent allowance (see chart). However, it is purely theoretical for someone earning Rs 12.75 lakh to invest in tax savings schemes , avail HRA (Rs 3,82,500), and standard deduction, chalking it up to Rs 9,57,000.However, as the tax incidences under the new scheme go up sharply after the Rs 12 lakh level, the decision to pay tax under the old regime would make sense only if the taxpayer invests Rs 5.25 lakh in tax saving schemes.Even if the taxpayer with income of Rs 13.75 lakh does not avail of HRA, his tax liability at Rs 57,500 under old system will be lower than the outgo of Rs 75,000 under the new regime. Same is true for income up to Rs 15.75 lakh, where the tax liability without HRA in the old system will be lower than the new regime but the rider of Rs 5.25 lakh investment in savings schemes holds. Even with HRA, old regime would be a better choice.The picture changes at incomes of Rs 20 lakh (Rs 20.75 lakh for salaried) where new tax regime will be beneficial over the old. Setting HRA aside, a taxpayer's liability on income of Rs 20 lakh will be Rs 2,40,000 under old system even after investing Rs 5.25 lakh in savings scheme, against Rs 2 lakh in the new system, where no deductions are allowed.At the income level of Rs 24 lakh also, the taxpayer will save Rs 60,000 under the new regime. Under the old system, his tax liability after investing the maximum possible of Rs 5.25 lakh in savings schemes will be Rs 3.60 lakh as against Rs 3 lakh in the old scheme.Above the income of Rs 15,75,000, if a taxpayer is claiming HRA of more than Rs 3 lakh, he should opt for old tax system provided he invests Rs 5.25 lakh in savings schemes.","Budget proposes tax rebate of Rs 60,000 on income up to Rs 12 lakh (and Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried people) New tax regime is better than old even if one is availing maximum possible deductions of Rs 5,75,000 and 30% of salary as house rent allowance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117842799,imgsize-67370,width-400,resizemode-4/117842799.jpg"

Alex and Pete are two of the most talented and popular players in Major League Baseball who have coincidentally found themselves dealing with the same issue of free agency as fans speculate their next move.But it seems like, they might sign a deal together soon with one of the strongest teams in the MLB - the Toronto Blue Jays .As per MLB Insider, Hector Gomez’s recent post on X, the Toronto Blue Jays have offered a three year deal to Pete Alonso and a six year deal to Alex Bregman. It has been a couple of weeks since the Toronto Blue Jays had expressed interest in both Alex Bregman and Pete Alonso but the real question remains - will the star players finally sign with the Blue Jays?Fans are pretty divided about this speculation; a fan took to X and wrote, “It's clear Alonso is still in talks with the Mets trying to get a deal done...if not he would have taken the #BlueJays deal.”Another fan also expressed doubt whether Pete Alonso and Alex Bregman would pick the Toronto Blue Jays over other teams. The fan wrote, “Either of them, but more than likely, neither of them.”But this is not all; fans are also pretty worried about Vladimir Guerrero Jr. if in case both Alex Bregman and Pete Alonso ends up joining the Toronto Blue Jays. A fan wrote, “Hector, if they sign both then what would happen to Vladdy Jr this season?”As per reports, the Toronto Blue Jays are “in talks” with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. for a contract extension but nothing has been confirmed yet.Both Alex Bregman and Pete Alonso share the same sports agency, the Boras Corporation, which is led by Scott Boras. Scott has been slammed by fans as people blame him for Alex Bregman and Pete Alonso’s current situation. Many even believed that the two might fire Scott Boras soon. While nothing is known about Alex Bregman’s situation, apparently Pete Alonso wishes to continue working with Scott Boras , as per Ben Nicholson Smith of Sportsnet.Ben Nicholson Smith recently made a post on X that read as, “A source said MLB agents have recently been informed they cannot contact Pete Alonso. This would have to be initiated by Alonso himself. Evidently, Alonso wants to continue working with his agent Scott Boras without hearing from other agents looking to poach him.”With Spring Training being a couple of days away, the star players have to come to a final decision and sign a deal soon.Also Read: Is Pete Alonso using the New York Mets as leverage to get a better deal?

No, They Can Lead to Economic Disruptions Yes, They Protect National Interests

NEW DELHI: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday announced that Canada would impose 25% tariffs on $106 billion worth US imports in a retaliatory move against Donald Trump. This came moments after the latter signed the executive order imposing steep tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, escalating tensions in an emerging trade war.""Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25% tariffs against Can$155 billion ($106 billion) worth of American goods,"" he saidHe urged the Canadians to prevent vacationing in US to fight back over the tariff imposition.Further, Trudeau announced that retaliatory duties on $30 billion worth of US alcohol and fruit will take effect Tuesday, coinciding with the implementation of US tariffs. He began his address with a direct message to American consumers.“It will have real consequences for you, the American people,” he said.“The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together,” Trudeau said, warning that it could bring about “dark times"" for many.Trump declared an economic emergency to impose tariffs of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada. However, energy imports from Canada—including oil, natural gas, and electricity—would be subject to a reduced 10% tariff.""Today, I have implemented a 25% Tariff on Imports from Mexico and Canada (10% on Canadian Energy), and a 10% additional Tariff on China. This was done through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl. We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as President to ensure the safety of all. I made a promise on my Campaign to stop the flood of illegal aliens and drugs from pouring across our Borders, and Americans overwhelmingly voted in favor of it,"" Trump said in a post on social media.Trump has argued that the government should rely more on tariff revenue, as it did before the introduction of the income tax in 1913. He asserts—despite economic evidence to the contrary—that the US was at its wealthiest during the 1890s under then-President William McKinley.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday announced that Canada would impose 25% tariffs on $106 billion worth US imports.

The crypto market is a dynamic space conducive to growth and innovation. Here are four new crypto coins that demand attention this quarter.Whales are a constant challenge in the meme coin market.

The community membership comes with exclusive access to trading signals, alpha calls, and market insights that help navigate the unpredictable crypto market.In essence, Wall Street Pepe combines humour with purpose to create a noteworthy meme coin project.

He drew attention to the project’s standout features and why they could be a game-changer. Best Wallet is setting a new standard in crypto management.The Solana blockchain is popular, yes. But it is facing growing pains as its popularity soars. High demand has led to network congestion, delayed transactions, and increased fees.Solaxy is bringing the first Layer-2 solution to Solana. It takes a creative route to improve the blockchain’s performance. The platform uses roll-up technology to act as an off-ramp for Solana’s mainnet. The transactions are processed on a secondary chain, bundled together, and sent back for confirmation. Here is how it helps:The Solaxy ecosystem revolves around its native token, $SOLX. It powers not just transaction fees, but also governance mechanisms and passive rewards. Early investors can lock their tokens during the presale to earn attractive APYs. Over 3 billion tokens have already been locked, reflecting strong community interest in the project.While utility drives Solaxy, its meme coin persona is no less captivating. The Pepe-Einstein avatar is designed to capture attention. It taps into meme coin hype while anchoring its value in real-world functionality.In just two days of launch, the $MIND crypto token presale raised $4 million. With tokens available at discounted rates during the presale, the interest in the new AI crypto agent is growing.By streamlining the network, Solaxy aims to offer users an efficient blockchain experience for both developers and investors. The ongoing $SOLX presale has raised $15 million so far.The Layer-2 market is valued at nearly $20 billion. It is booming as investors seek scalable solutions for blockchain congestion. Solaxy is positioned as one of Solana’s first Layer-2. With Solana’s thriving community and diverse new altcoin projects, Solaxy’s debut is awaited. It could emerge as a key player in the ecosystem’s growth.While there is a crowd of new meme coins, what makes MIND of Pepe stand out in the crowded new altcoin space? The platform operates as an autonomous AI agent.It runs its own X (Twitter) account and identifies emerging trends using hive-MIND analysis.

Why did the profits dip from the previous quarters ?

South Korean electronics giant Samsung reported a staggering 129.85 per cent year-on-year surge for the fourth quarter ending in December.It registered a growth of 6.5 trillion won, in its operating profits on Friday, against 2.82 trillion won, over the corresponding period last year.However, this growth in the fourth quarter was still low from its previous quarter for 2024 which stood at 9.18 trillion won, amid struggles in fulfilling demand for chips used in artificial intelligence servers.This announcement follows the company’s announcement in October, when it admitted going through a “crisis” and concerns were raised about its ""fundamental technological competitiveness and the future of the company"".The company recorded a net income growth of 22.2 per cent from the previous year at 7.75 trillion won.Sales also followed an upward momentum with a 11.8 percent growth at 75.78 trillion won.AFP reported that the company's net profit was higher than expected, according to Yonhap News Agency, which cited its own financial data firm.Samsung, the family-controlled conglomerates that dominate Asia's fourth-largest economy, said that the dip in profits from the previous quarter was due to ""soft market conditions especially for IT products, and an increase in expenditures including R&D.""""In the first quarter of 2025... overall earnings improvement may be limited due to weakness in the semiconductors business,"" it added.It has also been facing tough competition from its Korean rival SK hynix, which is US tech giant Nvidia’s main supplier of high-bandwidth memory (HBM).Samsung has been falling short of meeting Nvidia's requirements.Gloria Tsuen, a Moody's Ratings vice president and senior credit officer toldd AFP that Samsung’s technology leadership ""in the semiconductor market has been eroded over the last few years.""""The rapidly increasing demand for AI chips also heightens the technological difficulty in developing new, custom-made chips for customers in a timely manner,"" she added.","South Korean electronics giant Samsung reported a staggering 129.85 per cent year-on-year surge for the fourth quarter ending in December.

Donald Trump Economy: Donald Trump inherits strong economy as US growth rate hits 2.8% in 2024 amid ongoing inflation concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-growth-data-donald-trump-inherits-strong-economy-as-us-growth-rate-hits-2-8-in-2024-amid-ongoing-inflation-concerns/articleshow/117746316.cms,"Consumer spending remains robust



Inflation pressures persist



Donald Trump inherits a healthy economy



Global comparison



The US economy wrapped up 2024 on a solid note, with consumer spending and government support playing key roles in driving growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department.Despite some challenges, the economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected. For the full year, GDP grew by 2.8%, a strong performance, although slightly down from the 2.9% growth in 2023.Consumer spending rose by 4.2% in the final quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since early 2023. This growth was up from 3.7% in the previous quarter. The economy also benefitted from government spending and continued investment, although business investment slowed, particularly in equipment spending, which fell sharply after two strong quarters.Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, said, ""Consumers have been the foundation of the economy, and they've been the biggest driver of resilient growth in 2024,"" as quoted by the AFP news agency. He believes this growth will continue, supported by low layoffs, healthy job growth, and rising wages.The report also showed ongoing inflation. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, increased by 2.5%, slightly up from 2.2% in the previous quarter.Despite these inflation pressures, the economy remained strong. A key part of GDP, which excludes volatile items like exports and inventories, grew by 3.2% in the third quarter, down from 3.4% in the previous quarter.President Donald Trump, who took office in January 2025, inherited a strong economy, with growth continuing despite high interest rates. Unemployment was 4.1% in December, and job gains stayed steady. The Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged in December, after cutting it three times since September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell was quoted as saying to the Associated Press, “We do not need to be in a hurry to make more cuts,” due to the economy’s strength.The US economy is growing strongly, while Europe is struggling, having seen zero growth at the end of last year. The European Central Bank recently lowered its benchmark rate due to weak performance. In the US, strong consumer spending, low unemployment, and rising wages have helped maintain growth, despite ongoing inflation concerns.Trump has promised to cut taxes and reduce business regulations, but his plans on tariffs and immigration might slow growth and raise prices. KPMG's chief economist, Diane Swonk, pointed out that the effects of these policies will take time. While some analysts expect growth to slow in 2025, they still believe the US economy will remain strong for now.","US economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected.

Tesla results miss estimates as company projects 2025 auto volume growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-results-miss-estimates-as-company-projects-2025-auto-volume-growth/articleshow/117716151.cms,"Full autonomy soon?

Tesla reported lower than expected profits Wednesday but confirmed key 2025 benchmarks, saying it will return to sales volume growth and move forward with fully autonomous driving.The results -- the first since the return of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ally Donald Trump to the White House -- capped a mixed year for Tesla in which Musk's big bet on US electoral politics was countered by profit pressures as Tesla's streak of annual car volume growth came to an end.The electric car company reported fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter, where profits were boosted by a one-time tax benefit.Revenues rose two percent to $25.7 billion, also missing analyst estimates, but reflecting a more than doubling of sales in energy generation and storage.Musk has sought to temper expectations about Tesla's near-term financial growth, while employing superlatives in touting Tesla's autonomous driving and robotic ventures, saying they could make Tesla ""the most valuable company in the world by far,"" worth more than the ""next five companies combined.""Musk, who spent some $270 million or more to help Trump win the White House, largely steered clear of political subjects during the 65-minute conference call.The company has been confronted by intensifying EV competition in leading markets, including China and the United States, where General Motors and Ford have introduced more models.Another factor has been lower sales than expected from the Cybertruck, Musk's futuristic auto giant that has won cheers from Tesla fans and jeers from critics.But Tesla expects growth in 2025, saying in its earnings release that ""with the advancements in vehicle autonomy and the introduction of new products, we expect the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025.""The company confirmed plans to unveil new, more affordable vehicles in 2025 and said its launch of a new robotaxi venture in parts of the United States was on track to begin this year.Tesla named its driver-assistance programs ""autopilot"" and ""full self-driving"" (FSD), even though the programs require the driver to maintain attention, while rival robotaxi venture Waymo has achieved full driverless functionality in three US cities so far.Musk has repeatedly missed earlier targets towards full autonomy, quipping during Wednesday that he was like the boy who cried wolf.""But I'm telling you, there's a damn wolf this time, and you can drive it,"" Musk said. ""In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf.""Musk said he intends to launch FSD as a paid service in Austin, Texas this year, where the company also plans to introduce robotaxi services.""Teslas will be in the wild,"" he said, describing a gradual expansion of service once the company can demonstrate its autonomous service is ""unequivocally safer"" than a human driver.Musk did not directly comment on how his alliance with Trump will affect Tesla.The billionaire's widening influence and activism on behalf of far-right political movements has drawn rising attention and blowback. Polling data released Wednesday by YouGov showed Musk with a 44 percent favorable public opinion compared with a 48 percent negative.That's a worse ratio than Trump, who came in at three points net-positive, according to YouGov.A coalition that includes a public workers union has filed a lawsuit to block Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, arguing the panel flouts federal laws and is ""beset"" by the conflicts of interest of an extremist ""libertarian billionaire class.""And only days after being criticized for a hand gesture at Trump's inauguration that resembled a Nazi salute, Musk drew scrutiny last weekend for reiterating support for Germany's far-right, anti-immigrant AfD party, including comments that young Germans should feel able ""to move beyond"" expressing regret for the Holocaust.During the call, Musk's most overtly political comment concerned what he described as the cumbersome process to introduce FSD in Europe, calling Europe ""a layer cake of regulations and bureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed.""Shares of Tesla rose 4.4 percent in after-hours trading.","Tesla reports fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter.

DeepSeek: How a nerd with ‘terrible haircut’ shook up Silicon Valley's AI race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/deepseek-how-a-nerd-with-terrible-haircut-shook-up-silicon-valleys-ai-race/articleshow/117693138.cms,"The independent research group envisioned by High-Flyer took shape as DeepSeek. High-Flyer's founder and controlling shareholder, Liang Wenfeng, also serves as DeepSeek's discreet leader.

Poll Do You Believe DeepSeek's Success Will Lead to More Global AI Competition? No, Nvidia Will Continue to Lead Yes, It Could Disrupt the Current AI Market

Why it matters

DeepSeek’s AI is more than just another chatbot—it’s a symbol of China’s growing technological self-sufficiency. Its breakthrough challenges the long-standing assumption that the US holds an insurmountable lead in artificial intelligence.

At the core of US confidence was the belief that China needed American technology—particularly advanced semiconductors from Nvidia—to train competitive AI models. To maintain its dominance, Washington banned the export of high-end AI chips to China in 2022 and further tightened restrictions in 2023. Many assumed these moves would kneecap China’s AI ambitions.

Yet, DeepSeek has shattered that certainty. The company claims it trained its AI model using only 2,000 Nvidia chips , whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models. Even more astonishingly, OpenAI reportedly spent $1 billion on training ChatGPT, while DeepSeek did it with just about $6 million.

, whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models. Even more astonishingly, OpenAI reportedly spent $1 billion on training ChatGPT, while DeepSeek did it with just about $6 million. If these claims hold true, it could fundamentally reshape the AI industry. The assumption that cutting-edge AI requires enormous computing power, billion-dollar investments, and thousands of advanced chips may no longer be valid. Instead, DeepSeek has demonstrated that a highly efficient approach to AI training could level the playing field—allowing smaller players, and even adversarial nations, to catch up quickly.

Between the lines: How did DeepSeek pull this off?

1. A different approach to AI training:

This is akin to a search engine librarian:

2. A strategic stockpile of Nvidia chips

3. China’s ‘AI super geeks’ approach

A Trojan horse?

The rise of DeepSeek raises a troubling question for Washington: Could this technology be a Trojan horse? Under Chinese law, all tech companies are required to “cooperate with national intelligence efforts.” This means that any data fed into DeepSeek’s chatbot could, in theory, be accessible to the Chinese state.

Some analysts fear that DeepSeek’s chatbot could function as an AI-powered intelligence-gathering tool, subtly siphoning off user information under the guise of casual interactions. Others point to its built-in political censorship—when asked about topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre or China’s treatment of Uyghurs, DeepSeek either refuses to answer or echoes the Chinese government’s official stance.

With TikTok already under scrutiny in the US for alleged data harvesting, DeepSeek’s explosive rise is triggering similar concerns. The White House’s AI task force is reportedly investigating whether the platform poses a national security risk. “We should be alarmed,” said Ross Burley, co-founder of the Centre for Information Resilience. “Beijing has repeatedly weaponized its tech dominance for surveillance, control, and coercion,” Burley told Guardian.

What they’re saying

DeepSeek’s sudden rise has sparked polarizing reactions across the tech world:

President Donald Trump: Called DeepSeek a ""wake-up call"" for US industries, warning that China’s AI leap could threaten American economic and national security.

Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO): Praised DeepSeek as “impressive” and welcomed the competition, despite previously framing AI development as a battle between democracy and authoritarianism.

Elon Musk: Expressed doubts, suggesting that DeepSeek downplayed its use of banned US chips.

US National Security Officials: Are now investigating potential data security risks, given that DeepSeek stores user data on servers in China—raising concerns about state surveillance.

What’s next?

DeepSeek’s rise throws a wrench into Washington’s AI strategy. The US has aggressively restricted China’s access to advanced AI chips, believing that these controls would slow Beijing’s progress. But DeepSeek’s breakthrough suggests that China has found ways to innovate despite these restrictions.

Stronger US export controls : The Trump administrations will likely tighten AI-related export bans.

Bottom line

China’s AI industry has delivered a seismic shock to the world. DeepSeek , a little-known startup, has unveiled a generative AI model that is reportedly as powerful as OpenAI’s ChatGPT—but developed at a fraction of the cost. This breakthrough, described by Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen as a ""Sputnik moment,"" has rattled global tech markets.The fallout was immediate.US tech stocks suffered a bloodbath, losing nearly $1 trillion in value in a single day. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, saw $589 billion wiped off its market capitalization in what is now the largest one-day loss for any company in US history. The panic was fueled by fears that China’s AI could compete—and even surpass—US advancements while circumventing Washington’s chip restrictions.DeepSeek’s rise represents a stunning reversal of expectations. Just two years ago, China’s AI scene was seen as lagging behind the US. Beijing’s early attempts at ChatGPT-like models, such as Baidu’s Ernie and Tencent’s Hunyuan, were dismissed as inferior copies. Now, DeepSeek has positioned itself as a real contender, proving that China’s AI talent and research ecosystem are capable of groundbreaking innovation.DeepSeek’s success hinges on an unconventional training method. Traditional AI models process vast amounts of data, requiring massive computational resources. DeepSeek’s approach is different—it prioritizes knowing where to look for answers rather than memorizing everything.Traditional AI models behave like a librarian who has read every book in the library and pulls from memory to answer questions. DeepSeek’s model doesn’t read every book in advance. Instead, it quickly finds the right book when asked a question—a more efficient and cost-effective approach. This technique, combined with a “mixture of experts” strategy—which assigns specialized AI models to different types of questions—dramatically reduces the computing power needed to train AI.While the US tried to block China from accessing advanced AI chips, DeepSeek found a loophole. Before Washington closed the door in 2023, DeepSeek and other Chinese firms stockpiled tens of thousands of Nvidia’s A100 and H800 chips.These chips, though slightly less powerful than Nvidia’s cutting-edge H100, were still good enough for training DeepSeek’s AI. Some experts, including Elon Musk, have speculated that DeepSeek may have secretly acquired more high-end chips than disclosed.The brains behind DeepSeek is a 39-year-old Chinese hedge funder named Liang Wenfeng . As per a CNN report, in interviews with the state-linked financial outlet Yicai, early business associates described the future DeepSeek founder as somewhat “nerdy” and recalled “a terrible haircut” he once had.Liang Wenfeng believes in hiring fresh graduates over experienced professionals. His rationale?Experienced engineers follow conventional approaches. Young engineers are more willing to experiment and think outside the box. This philosophy appears to have worked. Liang’s team of under 140 researchers—mostly graduates from China’s elite universities—designed a breakthrough AI system in record time. Their success has boosted morale in China’s tech industry, with Liang now celebrated as one of China’s ""AI heroes.""DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough signals a shift in the global AI landscape. While it’s unclear if China will ultimately overtake the US in AI, one thing is certain: Silicon Valley’s AI monopoly is no longer guaranteed.(With inputs from agencies)","DeepSeek claims it trained its AI model using only 2,000 Nvidia chips, whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models.

'DeepSeek DID NOT build OpenAI for USD 5M' : Bernstein dismisses the Chinese company's claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/deepseek-did-not-build-openai-for-usd-5m-bernstein-dismisses-the-chinese-companys-claims/articleshow/117678472.cms,"Was it really $ 5 million?

DeepSeek, a new AI company seen as a potential rival to OpenAI, has gained massive success across social media, sending global stock markets into a frenzy. However, a recent report by Bernstein cautioned that while the company’s achievements are impressive, the claims of building an AI system comparable to OpenAI for just $5 million are not true.The report said that the claim is misleading and does not reflect the bigger picture.Bernstein stated, ""We believe that DeepSeek DID NOT ""build OpenAI for USD 5M""; the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and the resulting Twitter-verse panic over the weekend seems overblown"".The report said that DeepSeek developed two main AI models: the DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek R1. The V3 model, a large language model, utilises a mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture, which combines multiple smaller models to achieve high performance while using fewer computing resources than traditional large models.On the other hand, the V3 model boasts 671 billion parameters, with 37 billion active at any given time, and incorporated with innovations like multi-head latent attention (MHLA) to reduce memory usage and mixed-precision training with FP8 computation for greater efficiency.Training the V3 model involved a cluster of 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs over a two-month period which sums up around 5.5 million GPU hours.While some estimates put the training cost at approximately $ 5 million, the report highlighted that this figure only considers the computational resources, leaving out the significant costs related to research, experimentation, and other developmental expenses.The DeepSeek R1 model builds upon the V3’s foundation by using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and other techniques to enhance reasoning capabilities. The R1 model has performed competitively with OpenAI’s models in reasoning tasks. However, Bernstein pointed out that the additional resources required to develop the R1 model were substantial, though not detailed in DeepSeek’s research paper.Commenting on the hype, Bernstein noted that DeepSeek's models are impressive.For example, the V3 model performs as well as or better than other large models in language, coding, and mathematics while consuming a fraction of the computational resources. Pre-training the V3 model required just 2.7 million GPU hours, or only 9 per cent of the compute resources needed for some leading models.In conclusion, while DeepSeek’s advancements are noteworthy, the report urged caution in the face of exaggerated claims. While the company’s work is groundbreaking, the notion of creating an OpenAI competitor for just $ 5 million appears to be false.","DeepSeek, a new AI company seen as a potential rival to OpenAI, has gained massive success across social media, sending global stock markets into a frenzy.

Three years ago, Liang Wenfeng 's quantitative hedge fund firm apologised profusely to investors for losing money during a tumultuous period for China's stock market.It was a surprising stumble for Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management , which used artificial intelligence to pick stocks and had grown rapidly to become one of the country's largest quant funds.As the firm navigated through that crisis and its assets shrunk by more than a third from a peak of more than $12 billion, behind the scenes Liang was laying the groundwork for a new AI startup, DeepSeek .DeepSeek, which grew out of High-Flyer, is now threatening to upend the global AI supply chain and challenge the seemingly-unassailable US lead in critical frontier AI technologies. The sudden popularity of the 20-month-old firm's breakthrough technology and its namesake app sparked a massive US and European stock rout on Monday, wiping out close to $1 trillion in combined market value from chip giant Nvidia and other peers.It has also drawn shock and awe over how Liang, an engineering graduate who has never studied or worked outside of mainland China, pulled off such a feat. He has demonstrated that with local artificial intelligence engineers, constrained access to the latest semiconductor technologies and limited resources, it is possible to match - and even surpass - the best in the field.The question now gripping investors, companies and policymakers is whether artificial intelligence requires hundreds of billions of dollars in capital expenditure to come up with the latest innovations and vanguard AI models - and whether export controls can hold off Chinese competition.Liang has been compared to OpenAI founder Sam Altman, but the Chinese citizen keeps a much lower profile and seldom speaks publicly. ""OpenAI is not a god and cannot always be at the forefront,"" Liang told Chinese media outlet 36Kr in July 2024.The previous year, Liang said more investment doesn't necessarily lead to more innovation. He has also opined on how Chinese companies have long been mostly followers as opposed to technology innovators. The problem has been a ""lack of confidence and not knowing how to organize high-density talents to achieve effective innovation,"" he was quoted as saying.Liang was born in 1985 in Zhanjiang, an economically poor city in China's southern Guangdong province. His father was an elementary school teacher. He studied electronic engineering at Zhejiang University, a prestigious college in the city of Hangzhou, and also earned a master's degree in information and communication engineering there.DeepSeek's research was funded by High-Flyer's R&D budget, Liang said previously. It drew computing resources from the quant fund, which had amassed 10,000 Nvidia GPUs in 2021, prior to US bans on exports of sophisticated Nvidia chips and GPUs.Liang recruited engineering talent almost exclusively from China. Many were fresh out of top universities, interns in their final leg of doctoral studies and Olympiad medal holders. bloomberg","Liang Wenfeng's quantitative hedge fund firm apologised profusely to investors for losing money during a tumultuous period for China's stock market.

Coca-Cola has recalled certain batches of its soft drinks across Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands after routine safety checks at its Ghent production plant revealed higher-than-normal levels of chlorate. The affected products include Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite, Minute Maid, and Fuze Tea, with production codes ranging from 328 GE to 338 GE.Chlorate, a byproduct of chlorine disinfectants used in water treatment, can potentially disrupt thyroid function, especially in children. The European Union's rapid alert system notified health authorities in Denmark, Portugal, and Romania to investigate whether contaminated drinks had reached store shelves or vending machines in those countries. The risk was categorised as ""serious.""Coca-Cola has assured consumers that the issue was traced to a single container used in the water treatment process at its Ghent facility.

Poll Is DeepSeek's AI Technology Superior to Other Available AI Tools? No, It Still Has a Long Way to Go Yes, It’s a Game Changer

The trigger?

Why it matters

DeepSeek’s announcement is more than a technological milestone—it’s a direct challenge to Silicon Valley’s dominance in AI. For years, US companies like OpenAI and Google have relied on their ability to spend billions on AI infrastructure and development, creating an almost unassailable competitive moat. Nvidia’s dominance in AI chips has fueled a skyrocketing valuation, with its GPUs seen as indispensable for training large language models (LLMs).

But DeepSeek’s revelation threatens to undercut this economic model. By demonstrating that high-performing AI models can be developed cheaply using fewer resources, the company has thrown into question the sustainability of these enormous capital expenditures. If the cost of training AI drops significantly, demand for high-end GPUs, advanced data centers, and specialized cloud services could fall, upending the financial prospects of US tech titans.

DeepSeek’s “Sputnik moment”

The scale and efficiency of DeepSeek’s breakthrough have led to comparisons with the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik in 1957—a moment that catalyzed the space race. Silicon Valley heavyweight Marc Andreessen called the R1 model “AI’s Sputnik moment” and “one of the most amazing breakthroughs” in the field. Even President Donald Trump weighed in, describing the development as a “wake-up call” for US industries. “Instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same solution,” he said.

Nvidia Stock Beaten Down Due to DeepSeek

The new economics of AI

Geopolitical implications

A turning point for markets

For over two years, artificial intelligence (AI) has driven one of the most dramatic stock market rallies in history. Nvidia, the chipmaking giant and cornerstone of the AI revolution, became synonymous with the soaring optimism surrounding AI’s potential to reshape industries. Yet, on Monday, this euphoria came to a screeching halt. Nvidia suffered a historic $589 billion loss in market value—the largest one-day drop for a company in Wall Street history—sparking widespread panic in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and wiping nearly $1 trillion from global markets.A Chinese startup called DeepSeek , which last week announced a breakthrough in AI technology that threatens to upend the economics of the industry. The Hangzhou-based company introduced its R1 AI model, claiming it could rival the most advanced models from Silicon Valley titans like OpenAI and Google—for a fraction of the cost. The disruptive potential of DeepSeek’s innovation rattled investor confidence, sending ripples through the global tech ecosystem.Monday’s selloff was nothing short of catastrophic. Nvidia’s stock plummeted 17%, marking its lowest point since October and shaving billions off the fortunes of its investors. CEO Jensen Huang alone lost $21 billion from his net worth. Broadcom, another major player in AI chips, saw its shares fall 17.4%, while Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta faced declines ranging from 2% to 4%. Even power utility firms like Vistra and Constellation Energy, which are critical to the data center infrastructure powering AI, saw their stocks fall by 28.3% and 20.8%, respectively.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3%, dragging down the broader S&P 500 tech sector, which fell 5.6%. This was the sector’s worst one-day decline in over four years. By the end of the day, the global market had shed a staggering $1 trillion in value, a sharp reversal of the AI-driven gains that had propelled stocks to record highs over the past two years.DeepSeek, once an obscure startup, emerged as a serious player in the global AI race last week when it announced the release of its R1 model. According to the company, the R1 model can match the performance of OpenAI’s GPT-4 and other leading models while costing just $5.6 million to develop—a fraction of the hundreds of millions or even billions spent by U.S. firms. The company also claimed to have achieved this feat using Nvidia’s less powerful H800 chips, a move born of necessity due to U.S. export restrictions on more advanced GPUs like the H100.The timing of DeepSeek’s announcement could not have been more significant. Its AI chatbot, integrated with the R1 model, quickly became the most downloaded app on Apple’s US App Store, overtaking OpenAI’s ChatGPT. For Silicon Valley, the implications were clear: China had found a way to compete in the high-stakes AI game without the massive capital investments and infrastructure traditionally required.Despite the dramatic market response, not everyone is convinced of DeepSeek’s claims. Analysts like Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein and Atif Malik of Citigroup have questioned whether the R1 model can truly rival US counterparts at such a low cost. They pointed out that while DeepSeek may have used less advanced hardware, its ability to achieve cutting-edge performance without significant investments in GPUs remains debatable.There are also suspicions about how DeepSeek obtained its hardware. Elon Musk, who has heavily invested in Nvidia chips for his company xAI, speculated that DeepSeek may have acquired banned H100 chips through indirect channels. Alexandr Wang, CEO of Scale AI, echoed this sentiment, claiming that Chinese firms “have more H100s than people think.” Nvidia, however, stated that DeepSeek’s technology was “fully export control compliant.”The broader implications of DeepSeek’s rise are significant for U.S. tech companies. For years, firms like Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI have built their dominance on the premise that AI requires immense capital expenditure. Nvidia, for instance, has sold billions of dollars’ worth of high-end GPUs, becoming a linchpin of the AI revolution. But if DeepSeek’s claims hold, the demand for such hardware could decline, undermining the economic model that has driven the industry’s explosive growth.Nevertheless, some industry leaders see opportunity in DeepSeek’s innovation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the R1 model “an impressive competitor” and pledged to accelerate his company’s product releases. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella argued that cheaper AI would democratize access and drive broader adoption, potentially benefiting the global economy.DeepSeek’s announcement has forced a reevaluation of the economics of AI. For years, the development of large language models (LLMs) has been characterized by ballooning costs and resource-intensive processes. OpenAI’s GPT-4 reportedly cost over $100 million to train, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei suggested that some models are approaching $1 billion in development costs.In contrast, DeepSeek has demonstrated that advanced AI can be developed at a fraction of the cost, potentially reshaping how companies approach AI investments. This shift could benefit smaller players and startups, but it also raises questions about the billions already spent by Silicon Valley giants on data centers and infrastructure.DeepSeek’s success has broader geopolitical ramifications. The US has sought to curb China’s AI development through export controls and sanctions, limiting access to cutting-edge chips and technology. However, DeepSeek’s achievements suggest that these measures have not only failed but may have spurred innovation. By focusing on efficiency and resourcefulness, Chinese firms like DeepSeek are proving that they can compete with—and possibly surpass—their US counterparts.President Trump’s administration may now face pressure to tighten export restrictions further, a move that could escalate tensions with Beijing. At the same time, policymakers will need to consider how to foster innovation at home while maintaining a competitive edge.For investors, Monday’s selloff serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with overexposure to a single narrative. The AI boom, while transformative, has also fueled speculative behavior, with tech stocks reaching valuations that some argue are unsustainable. Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro, urged caution, noting that “panicking rarely makes for a good investment decision.”Yet, others see a silver lining. Lower costs could make AI more accessible, driving widespread adoption across industries and fueling long-term economic growth. As Joseph Amato of Neuberger Berman put it, “If you can invest less for a powerful model that has wider adoption, that’s got to be a good thing for the broad-based economy.”(With inputs from agencies)","A Chinese startup called DeepSeek announced a breakthrough in AI technology that threatens to upend the economics of the industry. The Hangzhou-based company introduced its R1 AI model, claiming it could rival most advanced models like OpenAI and Google—for a fraction of the cost. President Donald Trump described the development as a “wake-up call” for US industries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117629976,imgsize-2307832,width-400,resizemode-4/117629976.jpg"

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

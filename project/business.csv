"Sovereign Gold Bond 2017-18 series VI yields over 220% return in 7.5 years; RBI fixes premature redemption price at Rs 9,453 per gram on May 6",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/sovereign-gold-bond-2017-18-series-vi-yields-over-220-return-in-7-5-years-rbi-fixes-premature-redemption-price-at-rs-9453-per-gram-on-may-6/articleshow/120908633.cms,"AI generated image

Investors holding the Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) 2017-18 Series VI, issued on November 6, 2017, will be eligible for premature redemption on May 6, 2025, at a price of Rs 9,453 per gram, as notified by the Reserve Bank of India.This marks a gain of around 221% on the original issue price of Rs 2,945 per gram (or Rs 2,895 for investors), over a holding period of seven and a half years.In an official statement on Monday, the RBI said, “The redemption price for premature redemption due on May 06, 2025 shall be Rs 9,453/- (Rupees Nine Thousand Four Hundred and Fifty-Three only) per unit of SGB based on the simple average of closing gold price for the three business days i.e., April 30, May 02 and May 05, 2025.”According to the RBI the Sovereign Gold Bond 2017-18 Series VI was priced at Rs 2,945 per gram, based on the average closing price of gold of 999 purity from October 25 to 27, 2017. Investors who applied online and paid digitally had received a Rs 50 discount, bringing the effective issue price to Rs 2,895 per gram.The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme was launched in 2015 by the Government of India, in consultation with the RBI, as a financial alternative to physical gold investment.Bonds are issued in denominations of one gram of gold or multiples thereof, and are tradable and eligible for conversion to dematerialised form. Each tranche is open for limited subscription windows and comes with a fixed interest rate of 2.50% per annum, paid semi-annually.A key advantage for individual investors is the exemption from capital gains tax upon redemption.Speaking about the tax implications, Shalini Jain, Tax Partner at EY India, clarified “Sovereign Gold Bonds (‘SGB’) issued by the Reserve Bank of India and subsequently redeemed by the individuals do not attract any capital gains taxation. The tenure of SGBs is typically eight years, however, early encashment is permitted after the fifth year from the date of issue of such SGBs. This early encashment may also be regarded as redemption which is explicitly excluded from capital gains tax. ”She further added that while individual investors enjoy this benefit, HUFs and other entities are not covered under this exemption.“The relevant beneficial provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 specifically covers ‘redemption’ of SGB for individuals and does not include HUF and other entities. For HUFs and other entities, redemption of SGB will be liable to normal capital gains taxation,” Shalini Jain added.Redemption of SGBs is allowed only after the fifth year, and only on the interest payment dates. While the bonds have an eight-year maturity, this early exit option offers investors flexibility, especially in a rising gold market. The bonds can also be used as collateral for loans.","Investors holding the Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) 2017-18 Series VI, issued on November 6, 2017, will be eligible for premature redemption on May 6, 2025.

The central bank's income from foreign exchange reserves deployment in FY25 appears higher than the previous year, influenced by sustained elevated US treasury yields throughout several months, based on recent RBI data quoted by the Economic Times.This income, stemming from interest earnings on foreign assets, could contribute to an increase in the central bank's dividend payout to the government, which is already anticipated to be higher this year thanks to robust commissions from forex operations and interest income from government securities. However, analysts noted that accurately predicting the transfer amount could be challenging due to the complexity of provisioning exercises.During April-December 2024, interest earnings on RBI's foreign currency assets showed a 40 per cent increase to $17 billion compared to the previous year, as revealed in the central bank's recent breakdown of invisibles data.Historical assessment of RBI's financial statements indicates that forex deployment earnings constitute under 15 per cent of total income. Additional revenue streams include commissions from currency market management through dollar transactions, returns on government securities holdings, and income from liquidity operations.""We expect the RBI dividend to be supported by forex intervention as gross dollar sales have been substantial. Other sources of income will be interest income on government security and foreign currency assets,"" said Gaura Sengupta, chief economist at IDFC First Bank. ""On the expenditure side, how much provisioning is done can be a key variable,"" he added.The central bank is expected to declare its FY25 surplus funds transfer to the government in late May, following last year's Rs 2.1 lakh crore payment, which exceeded expectations twofold.As of March 28, 2025, RBI's economic capital stands at 28.5 per cent, above the recommended range of 20.4-25.4 per cent. Despite this, experts suggest higher provisioning might be necessary due to balance sheet expansion, driven by the bank's liquidity infusion into the banking system following two interest rate reductions.","Interest earnings on RBI's foreign currency assets showed a 40 per cent increase to $17 billion compared to the previous year.

China warns ‘unprecedented huge risks’ to global economy from US tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-warns-unprecedented-huge-risks-to-global-economy-from-us-tariffs/articleshow/120939565.cms,"AI-generated image (Credit: Bing image creator)

China's finance minister has criticized US tariffs for introducing “unprecedented huge risks” to global economic stability , according to a ministry publication released Tuesday.Simultaneously, China’s foreign ministry, via state-run Xinhua news agency, stated that the US must change its “threatening” stance if it hopes to reach any agreement.The ongoing trade dispute between the two major economies continues to escalate. US President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs of up to 145 per cent on Chinese goods, while Beijing has retaliated with 125 per cent duties on American imports.Speaking at an Asian Development Bank (ADB) conference in Milan that began on Sunday, Finance Minister Lan Fo’an refrained from directly naming the US but attributed rising risks to “a certain country (that) has launched tariff wars and trade wars.”“The current international situation is becoming more turbulent and chaotic, unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise,” he said, urging ADB members to uphold multilateral institutional regulations.Foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian, in a routine press briefing reported by Xinhua, said, “If a negotiated solution is truly what the United States wants, it should stop threatening and exerting pressure, and seek dialogue with China based on equality, respect and mutual benefit.”He added, “China's position is consistent and clear: We will fight, if fight we must. Our doors are open, if the United States wants to talk.”China’s commerce ministry hinted at possible trade talks on Friday, stating it was “currently evaluating” American negotiation proposals. However, it emphasized that Washington must first lift “unilateral tariffs” on Chinese goods—a condition Trump dismissed in an interview with NBC recorded Friday.In the interview, aired on Sunday, Trump asserted that China’s economy was “collapsing.”When asked about removing tariffs to encourage negotiations, he responded, “Why would I do that?”China has repeatedly affirmed its readiness to continue the trade conflict “to the end” if necessary. A video shared by its foreign ministry on social media declared the country would “never kneel down.”The tariff battle has disrupted markets and supply chains in both nations.Chinese manufacturing declined in April, with officials attributing the downturn to a “sharp shift” in global economic conditions.Meanwhile, US statistics released last Wednesday showed economic contraction in the first quarter, partly due to a spike in imports driven by Trump’s tariff policy.",China’s finance minister has criticized US tariffs for introducing “unprecedented huge risks” to global economic stability.

IBM expects over 1 billion apps to be built using GenAI by 2028. A recent IBM study found that business leaders expect to double down on their AI investments over the next two years, with most actively adopting AI agents and preparing to scale them. Till now, though, their pace of investments led to disconnected technology, and only 25% of AI initiatives achieved the return on investment (RoI) they expected. IBM chairman & CEO Arvind Krishna attributes this to access to enterprise data, the siloed nature of different applications, and the fragmentation happening in the infrastructure. ""That is why you see us focus on both hybrid cloud and AI together,"" he said in a virtual press conference on Monday ahead of its flagship Think event in the US.Krishna said clients are looking for productivity, cost savings, and scaling the revenue of their own companies.

LPs are not seeing the kind of cash they would like to, and for certain funds, there's no choice but to go ahead and seek an exit. Some companies hence are looking at cutting the issue size and tempering IPO valuations,"" Prabhav Kashyap, partner at Bain & Company told TOI.After a bull run last year, activity in India's IPO market has slowed, with companies like LG Electronics delaying listing plans for its India unit.On Tuesday, EV startup Ather Energy fell nearly 6% from its issue price following a muted listing. Urban Company, which recently filed draft IPO papers, slashed the size of its IPO to Rs 1,900 crore from the earlier targeted Rs 3,000 crore, with the offer for sale (OFS) component that gives exit to investors forming the bulk of the issue.Overall, PE-VC investments rebounded in 2024 after two years of contraction. Investments increased by about 9% year-on-year to $43 billion, helped by growth in VC deals (in terms of volumes). The broader deal environment this year remains cautious, with investors betting more on companies that have higher exposure to local markets. ""Deal activity is always impacted when there's any kind of uncertainty. In the case of sectors like manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, investors are assessing the potential impact from tariffs. There is a slowdown in overall investments. The big deals that have been announced this year were in the works and have only been closed now,"" Kashyap added.","The value of IPO exits more than doubled to nearly $4 billion in 2024 from $1.8 billion in 2023.

Auto cos fear lower UK tariffs may lead to Chinese dumping,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/auto-cos-fear-lower-uk-tariffs-may-lead-to-chinese-dumping/articleshow/120948406.cms,"New Delhi:

The Indian automobile industry reacted with caution to FTA with the UK, which aims to reduce import duty to 10%. Companies, which are awaiting finer details, fear that lower tariff rates may be replicated in other trade agreements under discussion. They are also concerned about the possibility of ""dumping of cheap Chinese parts and aggregates"" in the UK, which could then be diverted to India as fully-built products.While the Indian component industry welcomed the move, as duty on imports of India's parts to the UK will be slashed to zero, car companies remain tense in the absence of clarity. The auto industry is looking for details, such as by when (time period) the import duty for cars from the UK will come down to 10%. ""Also, we would like to understand what is the quota that has been specified. This means how many cars will be allowed to be imported under the lower tariffs every year,"" company officials and industry association executives told TOI.Some of the brands that are manufacturing in the UK and will benefit from lower import duty, include Tatas-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), luxury makers Bentley, Aston Martin, Rolls Royce, Lotus, and McLaren.These are, however, limited volume brands and may not have a direct bearing on the mainline brands. However, the UK also has factories of mainstream auto companies, such as Nissan and Toyota, who could now look at importing some of their models here at lower duty.Regarding Chinese threat, Indian industry fears UK companies may source cheap Chinese batteries, motors and other parts to UK and divert them to India at lower prices using FTA. ""We hope govt would have negotiated the clause around rules of origin, local value addition, and change in tariff heading to ensure that dumping from China can be contained. Only products with a substantial UK value addition should be allowed under FTA,"" officials said.On the two-wheeler front, companies like TVS, which has a UK brand, welcomed the deal. ""It creates large opportunities for Indian companies like ours to expand further and access new markets... Our British brand Norton will launch later this year and this agreement will help us scale faster and leverage common supply chains,"" Sudarshan Venu, MD of TVS Motor, said.Saurabh Agarwal, partner & automotive tax leader at EY India, said the deal will help auto component makers sell more in UK. ""Indians might be able to buy premium cars from UK at right price point as soon as they are launched globally. It probably won't shake up our local car manufacturers too much because most Indian consumers still prefer more affordable options.""","The Indian automobile industry reacted with caution to FTA with the UK.

All whiskies to be cheaper after duty cut on Scotch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/all-whiskies-to-be-cheaper-after-duty-cut-on-scotch/articleshow/120948370.cms,"Following the government's decision to reduce import duties to 75%, both Scotch and Indian-made blended whisky are set to become more affordable. This move is expected to significantly benefit Indian blenders and multinational companies, potentially leading to increased premiumisation within the Indian alcoholic beverage sector.

New Delhi:

It isn't just your favourite brand of Scotch and British gin that will get more affordable after the govt agreed to halve import duty to 75%, but even made-in-India blended whisky will become cheaper.Of all the whisky shipped from Scotland, industry estimates suggest nearly 79% comes in bulk form, that is then blended or bottled in India, with the remaining coming in what is called ""bottled in origin"" in trade parlance. The blending could be 2-3% in a low-end Indian whisky and could be as much as 30% in some of the premium brands, often referred to as Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), industry sources said.""There will be significant savings for Indian blenders as well as the multinational companies which produce IMFL,"" an industry executive said. The govt earlier planned a steeper duty cut for bulk whisky. Scotch makers couldn't ask for a better deal as the doors are wide open in what is now their largest market by volume. In 2024, India pipped France to once again become the largest export market by volume with 192 million bottles shipped, according to Scotch Whisky Association data.Naturally, the industry cheered the deal. ""It will be transformational for Scotch and Scotland, while powering jobs and investments in both India and the UK.The deal will increase the quality and choice for discerning consumers across India, the world's largest and most exciting whisky market,"" said Diageo CEO Debra Crew.Cheaper prices may also result in premiumisation. ""India's increasingly aspirational and discerning consumers will now have access to premium international brands at more accessible prices... We anticipate that this will accelerate the ongoing trend of premiumisation within the alcobev sector, positively impacting the exchequer revenues of Indian states,"" said International Spirits & Wines Association of India CEO Sanjit Padhi.""We only hope that govt has included a minimum import price to prevent dumping/under-invoicing and removal of non-tariff barriers to ensure better global market access to Indian alcoholic beverages.""We fear that if the same template of duty reduction is followed for trade deals with EU, US, and other nations which produce spirits and wines, then Indian alcobev industry, including wine sector, could get adversely impacted,"" said Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies CEO Anant Iyer.","The govt agreed to halve import duty to 75%, making Indian-made blended whisky more affordable.

China’s central bank rolled out major monetary easing measures on Wednesday, slashing a key interest rate and lowering the reserve requirement for banks as the economy reels under the pressure of renewed US tariffs and domestic weakness.The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced a 0.25 percentage point cut to its lending rate for commercial banks, bringing it down to 1.5%, according to news agencyThe central bank also reduced the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), the amount of money banks must hold in reserve, by 0.5 percentage points in a bid to spur more lending.The move marks one of the most significant policy interventions by Beijing since September 2024, and comes as US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, as high as 145% on many Chinese imports, begin to weigh heavily on China’s export-driven economy,reported.Pan Gongsheng, governor of the PBOC, confirmed the rate cuts at a news conference, saying the central bank would also lower its seven-day reverse repurchase rate to 1.4% from 1.5%.The lending rate for first-time homebuyers taking out loans over five years will be reduced from 2.85% to 2.6% in an effort to revive demand in the struggling property sector.Pan said the changes are part of broader efforts to “support technological innovation, boost consumption, and promote inclusive finance.”China is grappling with multiple economic challenges. Domestic consumption remains weak post-Covid, the once-booming real estate sector is still in crisis, and a global slowdown has further dampened demand for Chinese goods. Beijing has also retaliated to Washington’s tariff hike with 125% duties on US imports.Last month, China’s manufacturing output slumped, a downturn the government blamed on a “sharp shift” in global economic trends, while exports in March saw a sharp 12% surge as companies raced to beat Trump’s latest tariff round.China has set a 2025 GDP growth target of around 5%, the same as last year — a goal economists view as ambitious amid growing risks of a global slowdown and rising trade friction.While Beijing introduced several stimulus efforts last year, including interest rate cuts, eased homebuying restrictions, and debt limit hikes for local governments, analysts believe the growing impact of trade disruption may push Chinese authorities to unveil more aggressive economic support in the months ahead.",The People’s Bank of China announced a 0.25 percentage point cut to its lending rate for commercial banks.

The United States recorded its highest trade deficit in March, with the total shortfall expanding by 14.0 percent to $140.5 billion, according to the latest government data released on Tuesday.This marks the largest trade deficit since 1992, reflecting a $17.3 billion increase from February’s revised figure of $123.2 billion. The Commerce Department's report highlights a surge in business activity as companies pulled forward industrial supplies and retailers stocked up on consumer goods ahead of anticipated tariffs.This spike in the trade gap occurred prior to President Donald Trump ’s implementation of substantial tariffs on Chinese imports, alongside lower baseline duties of 10 percent on goods from most countries. The administration later raised tariffs on numerous nations, though these were suspended until July to allow for renegotiation of trade agreements.March’s trade deficit exceeded analysts' expectations, with forecasts from Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal predicting a shortfall of $137.6 billion.The trade imbalance was driven by a 4.4 percent increase in imports, which rose to $419.0 billion as consumers hurried to make purchases in anticipation of the tariffs.Consumer goods saw the most significant rise, with imports increasing by $22.5 billion. Exports grew slightly by 0.2 percent to $278.5 billion.Wells Fargo economists noted that while April may see a final surge of firms rushing to beat the tariffs, the outlook for net exports suggests a dramatic reversal in the months to come. ""April may bring a last ditch effort of firms front running tariffs, but after that net exports are set to reverse dramatically,"" he said.","The United States recorded its highest trade deficit in March, with the total shortfall expanding by 14.0 percent to $140.5 billion.

Tesla sales nosedived again in Germany last month even as electric vehicle sales rose strongly, data showed Tuesday, as German drivers voted with their wallets against billionaire owner Elon Musk.Just 885 Tesla electric vehicles (EVs) were registered in April, 45.9 percent fewer than the same month last year, the KBA federal transport authority said.That was almost half as many as BYD, a Chinese competitor, managed: 1,556 BYDs were registered in April, a rise of 756 percent on the year.At the same time, overall EV registrations rose 53.5 percent year-on-year and now account for almost 19 percent of the market, the highest share since the government removed a subsidy for electric vehicles in December 2023.Tesla's sales have been slowing worldwide due to a combination of fierce Chinese competition as well as anger at Musk's outspoken political positions.He has faced particular hostility in Germany for backing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) before February's general election by appearing via video link at a rally and broadcasting a conversation with its co-leader, Alice Weidel, on his X platform.Other political parties in Germany shun the AfD and Germany's domestic intelligence agency last week classified it as a right-wing extremist organisation.Some German Tesla drivers have put ""I bought this before Elon went crazy"" stickers on their vehicles and the backlash has also taken more forceful forms.Tesla cars have been targeted in suspected arson attacks in Berlin and Dresden, and protesters have staged demonstrations against the carmaker.Over the three months to April, Tesla registrations fell a whopping 60.4 percent from the same period a year ago.Overall car registrations in Germany fell 0.2 percent in April versus the previous year, a sign that the market is stabilising after they fell almost four percent in March.Tesla chairman Robyn Denholm last week denied that the carmaker's board was looking to replace Musk as CEO.","Just 885 Tesla electric vehicles were registered in April, 45.9 percent fewer than the same month last year.

Tourism in China saw a notable rise with increased consumer spending during the five-day Labour Day holiday; however, Chinese social media users questioned these statistics, citing various economic issues and declining exports, according to Radio Free Asia (RFA), quoted by ANI.According to China's ministry of transport data, daily cross-regional passenger travel averaged 293 million trips, showing an 8 per cent increase from the previous year, whilst major retail and dining sectors recorded 6.3 per cent revenue growth during the holiday period, RFA reported.Despite state media accounts, actual consumer sentiment and market performance during this year's May Day holiday period appeared considerably weaker than previous years.

Moody’s cuts China 2025 GDP growth forecast to 3.8% weighed by ongoing tariff tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/moodys-cuts-china-2025-gdp-growth-forecast-to-3-8-weighed-by-ongoing-tariff-tensions/articleshow/120930215.cms,"China’s economy is expected to undergo a major slowdown over the next two years, with GDP growth dipping below 4% as trade tensions intensify and global economic conditions weigh on investment and consumer confidence, a recent report by Moody’s Ratings said.The report projects Beijing’s real GDP growth for 2025 to stand at 3.8% and 3.9% in 2026, a sharp downgrade from its February projections of 4.5% and 4%, respectively. The outlook also falls well short of the Chinese government’s official 5% growth target.However, the country’s GDP rose by 5.4% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2025, indicating a strong start for the financial year. This early-year boost was largely driven by a surge in exports and a combination of government fiscal and monetary policies aimed towards stabilising growth.Fixed asset investment improved, property sector contraction eased, and credit demand levelled off while industrial production and retail sales also showed signs of recovery.However, the ratings agency also warned that without further stimulus beyond measures announced at the annual Two Sessions in March, the current momentum may not stay the same for long, with GDP growth decelerating below 4% dragged down by the ongoing trade tensions and weakening global growth.A steep decline in Chinese shipments to the US in April, combined with the growing impact of elevated tariffs, is casting a long shadow over the outlook for the coming months.“We estimate that export growth drove nearly a third of China’s economic growth in Q1 2025,” Moody’s said. “ “Repeating that feat from last year's high base would be difficult given ongoing tariff uncertainty and softer export demand.”At present, China faces a base 10% tariff and an additional 145% levy from the US, a move that could further strain already fragile trade relations.While there are indications that both sides are open to negotiations, no formal talks have begun, and Moody’s believes tariffs will remain “considerably restrictive” in the near term.The agency also cut its global growth forecast for 2025 and 2026, citing increased policy uncertainty, especially in the world’s two largest economies, the US and China. Despite Beijing’s continued investment in high-tech and green industries, Moody’s says domestic demand remains vulnerable.The report further added that even support from government’s fiscal and monetary policies is “unlikely to lift domestic demand enough to offset the negative impact on external demand”Commenting on the ongoing tariff war between Beijing and Washington, the report said that the trade measures imposed by the two nations on each other are “so prohibitively high that they would likely choke off most direct bilateral trade if they remain in place, on top of the likely short-term disruptions noted earlier.”","China's real GDP growth for 2025 to stand at 3.8% and 3.9% in 2026, a sharp downgrade from its February projections of 4.5% and 4%, respectively.

The company also withdrew its forecast for 2025 amid tariff uncertainty as auto sales fell due to the launch of new vehicles.The company posted $471 million in profits for the quarter, a figure that exceeded analyst expectations but was just a third of its earnings over the same period last year, while revenues fell by five percent to $40.7 billion.It reported a 7% drop in wholesale units, a decline it had flagged earlier, blaming slower production at its Kentucky and Michigan plants where new vehicle launches are underway.Ford is now estimating a $1.5 billion annual hit to adjusted operating earnings due to tariffs, which have hit a lot of companies and productions since Trump returned to the White House in January. These include levies on imported vehicles, steel, aluminium, and auto parts.Despite efforts to cushion the blow, including shifting vehicle shipments from Mexico to Canada and avoiding duties on parts that only transit through the US, the company expected the total impact of tariffs to reach $2.5 billion. Supply chain tweaks have helped shave $1 billion off that figure so far.“Our teams have done a lot to minimize the impact of tariffs on our business,” said chief financial officer Sherry House, as quoted by AFP.Ford’s “Pro” division, which targets fleet and commercial buyers, and its “Blue” division, covering traditional petrol and diesel models, both saw profits slide. However, losses narrowed in the electric vehicle segment.Chief executive Jim Farley said Ford was staying “very aggressive” in the market, extending an employee-pricing promotion to drive retail sales. The company reported a lift in April sales thanks to the campaign but warned that prices could start climbing later this year as tariff costs filter through to consumers.House acknowledged the possibility of a “potential compression” in sales during the second half of 2025. Overall, the carmaker now anticipates full-year sales to remain flat or rise by only around one percent.The US auto giant described its underlying business “strong,” claiming that it had aligned with the prior projection of falling in the range of $7 to $8.5 billion in adjusted operating earnings, apart from tariff related impacts.Adding to the challenges are concerns over changes to US emissions policies and restrictions by China on rare earth elements, which are essential for auto manufacturing. Chief operating officer Kumar Galhotra said that such moves could disrupt production for Ford or its competitors, potentially altering pricing strategies across the sector.Ford shares dropped 2.3% in after-hours trading following the announcement.",Ford posts 65% fall in first quarter profits to $471 million.

Warren Buffett to exit as CEO: Stakeholders weigh on Berkshire Hathaway's future under Greg Abel's leadership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffett-to-exit-as-ceo-stakeholders-weigh-berkshire-hathaways-future-under-greg-abels-leadership/articleshow/120905867.cms,"Warren Buffett to pass baton to Greg Abel

Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway are contemplating the future of the conglomerate following Warren Buffett 's unexpected announcement of stepping down as chief executive by year end. While most acknowledging that the company will remain stable under Vice Chairman Greg Abel's leadership who Buffett endorsed to be his successor, some stakeholders express concern about the absence of Buffett's unique insight and charisma.The $1.16 trillion organisation, encompassing 189 operating businesses, $264 billion in stocks and $348 billion in cash, faces uncertainty regarding its trajectory post-Buffett era. The announcement came after the annual meeting's question-answer session, with the board scheduled to discuss the transition.""There has been a premium on Berkshire because of Buffett,"" said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert.NXT, as quoted by news agency Reuters. ""Will people look at it in the same way?""Richard Casterline, a computer programmer from Denver, found the news startling and expressed interest in the market's reaction. He said, ""I don't think (Abel) elicits the same excitement. It's not any fault of his own, it's just thinking of who could be as legendary as those two are. It's just tough shoes to fill.""Despite concerns, Abel receives substantial support. Daniel Hanson senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman expressed complete confidence in Abel's capabilities, ""This is Buffett's baby, and he thoughtfully and deliberately planned for an orderly succession that does not disrupt the value of his life's work,"" he said, adding, ""I have full confidence in Greg's leadership.""Richard Lancaster compared the transition to Apple's leadership change from Steve Jobs to Tim Cook and adding, ""You have two different personalities, two different approaches.""""Greg has all the qualities Warren likes in a manager: very sharp individual, and well-versed in what's in the business climate today and the changes that will come through disruptive technologies,"" he also said.Under Buffett's stewardship, Berkshire's shareholder returns have consistently outperformed the S&P 500 (.SPX). The company's investment decisions often influenced market movements, even when Buffett wasn't directly involved.Abel's approach suggests possible adjustments. He indicated increased involvement in subsidiary oversight whilst maintaining their autonomy. Berkshire's diverse portfolio includes Geico insurance, BNSF railway, utilities, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and See's Candies, as reported by Reuters.The new leadership might adopt different approaches to business retention and divestment. Previously, Berkshire sold Applied Underwriters in 2019 and its newspaper holdings in 2020 due to market changes.","Warren Buffett to pass baton to Greg Abel by year end.

"In a tariff whirlwind, shoemaker Skechers to be acquired for $9 billion and taken private",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/in-a-tariff-whirlwind-shoemaker-skechers-to-be-acquired-for-9-billion-and-taken-private/articleshow/120905647.cms,"FILE - A Skechers sign is shown in San Francisco, March 17, 2024. (Photo: AP)

The shoe company Skechers is being acquired for more than $9 billion to be taken private by the investment firm by 3G Capital The deal comes amid growing uncertainty over how US President Donald Trump's tariffs on foreign goods will affect companies who make their products overseas, particularly in China. Athletic shoe makers have invested heavily in production in Asia.The offer of $63 per share represents a premium of 30% to Skechers' 15-day volume-weighted average stock price, and it was unanimously approved the deal.Skechers shares jumped nearly 25% Monday, to $61.59.In a press release announcing the deal, the companies did not mention the potential impacts of Trump's tariffs on its business going forward. However, Skechers says that about two-thirds of its revenue comes from sales outside of the US China accounts for 15% of the company's revenue, according to the data firm FactSet.The deal comes at a precarious time with Trump's ongoing, on-again-off-again tariff announcements. Like many other companies increasingly have done since Trump's widespread tariff announcements, Skechers did not issue guidance when it released its first quarter earnings in April. Chief Financial Officer John Vandemore told investors that the ""current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success.Executives also said they would be looking to minimize products going to the US from ""high-cost locations,"" including the impact of tariffs. The company did not immediately provide a breakdown of foreign production, but many of their shoes come with a ""Made in China"" stamp.Trump raised the tariff on Chinese imports to 125% in early April, hours after China boosted the duty on American goods to 84% in an escalating battle that threatens to disrupt trade between the world's two largest economies.Skechers executives said last month that the company had several ""levers"" it could pull to deal with tariffs, including cost sharing with vendors, sourcing optimization, and price adjustments.""We're looking at how we optimize the global cost of tariffs in all markets when we look to move production around,"" Vandemore said last month. ""Obviously, with an effective tariff rate at about 159%, products from China to the US are prohibitively expensive.""Skechers has about 5,300 retail stores worldwide, about 1,800 company-owned.About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the US are imported, predominantly from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for US companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs.When the deal closes, the company will be led by Skechers Chairman and CEO Robert Greenberg and his management team. Its headquarters will remain in Manhattan Beach, California, where it was founded more than three decades ago.Skechers reported a record $9 billion in revenue in 2024 with net earnings of $640 million.The deal with 3G Capital is expected to close in the third quarter this year.","Skechers shares jumped nearly 25% Monday, to $61.59.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

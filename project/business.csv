"Delhi's infra boost: PM Modi to inaugurate Dwarka Expressway, UER-II; Rs 11,000 crore project to decongest Capital",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/infrastructure/delhis-infra-boost-pm-modi-to-inaugurate-dwarka-expressway-uer-ii-rs-11000-crore-project-to-decongest-capital/articleshow/123336108.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate two major National Highway projects in Delhi on Sunday, with a combined value of nearly Rs 11,000 crore. The inauguration marks a significant step in government’s broader plan to ease congestion in the capital and improve connectivity across the region.The projects: the Delhi section of the Dwarka Expressway and the Urban Extension Road-II (UER-II), are expected to greatly cut travel time, decongest arterial routes, and provide smoother links between Delhi and its neighbouring cities.The 10.1 km Delhi section of the Dwarka Expressway has been built at a cost of around Rs 5,360 crore. It will not only help traffic movement but also provide multi-modal connectivity to Yashobhoomi, the DMRC Blue and Orange lines, the upcoming Bijwasan railway station, and the Dwarka cluster bus depot.Alongside this, the Alipur to Dichaon Kalan stretch of the Urban Extension Road-II (UER-II), including new links to Bahadurgarh and Sonipat, has been developed at a cost of Rs 5,580 crore. This new corridor will ease pressure on Delhi’s Inner and Outer Ring Roads, as well as busy intersections such as Mukarba Chowk, Dhaula Kuan, and NH-09.According to officials, Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the full 76-km UER-II, developed as the third Ring Road of Delhi, and the 29-km Dwarka Expressway on Sunday.Both roads form a central part of the Centre’s Delhi decongestion plan and are designed to reduce bottlenecks across the city’s ring roads and arterial networks.The Dwarka Expressway, fully operational, has been built in four packages at a cost of around Rs 9,000 crore. Its Haryana section was inaugurated by Modi in March 2024, just before the Lok Sabha elections. Meanwhile, the UER-II was executed in five packages with a total cost of Rs 7,716 crore.As per the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the UER-II begins at Alipur on NH-44 and connects with NH-9 and NH-48 in Delhi. Of the 76 km stretch, 54.2 km lies in Delhi while the remaining 21.5 km falls in Haryana. Conceived under the Delhi Master Plan 2021, it will also link the proposed IICC in Dwarka via the Dwarka Expressway, as per a TNN report.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to inaugurate two major National Highway projects in Delhi on Sunday.

IndiGo A321 suffers tail strike on landing in Mumbai in heavy rains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indigo-a321-suffers-tail-strike-on-landing-in-mumbai-in-heavy-rains/articleshow/123336839.cms,"MUMBAI: An IndiGo A321 aircraft, operating a flight from Bangkok, suffered a tail strike when landing in Mumbai in heavy rains in the early hours of Saturday.IndiGo flight 6E1060 departed Bangkok at 11.40 pm and landed in Mumbai around 3 am. But before it could touch down on runway 27 of the airport, the aircraft carried out a go-around, it descended to below 550 feet before the pilots decided to abort the landing and climb for a second attempt at touch down. The tail strike occurred during the go-around. A tail strike occurs when the tail, the aft section of the fuselage hits the runway or ground during a landing or take-off.“On August 16, 2025 an IndiGo Airbus A321 aircraft tail touched the runway while executing a low-altitude go-around due to unfavourable weather conditions in Mumbai. Thereafter, the aircraft carried out another approach and landed safely. Following the standard protocol, the aircraft will go through necessary checks/ repairs and regulatory clearance before resuming operations,” said IndiGo in a press statement. “At IndiGo, the safety of our customers, crew, and aircraft is our top priority. We are making all efforts to minimise any subsequent impact on our operations due to this incident,” it added.Sources pointed out that IndiGo did not inform the Mumbai air traffic control about the tail strike. “A tail strike could damage the runway surface, it could take out runway centre line flights or leave foreign objects on the runway, all of which is unsafe for the next aircraft that has lined up to take off or land. Airlines inform the ATC about tail strike because a runway inspection should be carried out after such an incident to ensure the safety of all aircraft operating from that runway,” said an aviation source.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is investigating the incident.On March 08, an Indigo A321 (VT-IBI) operating flight 6E-5325 from Mumbai to Chennai suffered a tail strike on landing. The aircraft was grounded following the incident. Prior to this incident, on Sept 09, last year, the same IndiGo A321 aircraft had a tails trike on departure from Delhi to Bengaluru. The aircraft continued its flight and landed without problems though the plane had sustained serious damage.In July 2023, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation levied a fine of Rs 30 lakhs on IndiGo after its aircraft suffered four tail strikes in a span of six months. The regulator found systematic deficiencies, including training and engineering procedures that led to the tail strikes. The A321 is a longer version of the A320 aircraft, its fuselage is 22 feet longer than the classic A320 aircraft.","IndiGo flight 6E1060 departed Bangkok at 11.40 pm and landed in Mumbai around 3 am.

Uncertainty over trade deal with US as Aug talks put off,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/uncertainty-over-trade-deal-with-us-as-aug-talks-put-off/articleshow/123339758.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Trump administration has put the bilateral trade deal with India into fresh uncertainty with a meeting of officials, scheduled to start from Aug 25, postponed and no fresh date shared with authorities here.Sources said a formal communication has not been received yet, but the postponement has been communicated verbally.

Trump has set a deadline of Aug 27 for tariff on Indian exports to the US to double to 50%, but the latest developments complicate matters further.The US president has imposed 25% tariff on Indian exports - higher than rivals - and proposed to slap secondary sanctions, resulting in 50% tariff, citing India's purchase of arms and oil from Russia.Uncertainty persists over the fate of additional tariff on Indian exports to the US after Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, though the US president's change of stance by aligning himself with Putin on a peace deal in Ukraine seems to have opened up a window of hope for New Delhi.Though the Alaska talks did not help Trump achieve his declared objective of an immediate truce, he has refrained from calling them a failure. Trump said he will wait for two to three weeks before moving on secondary tariffs on other countries, notably China, the largest buyer of Russian crude.","The US president has imposed 25% tariff on Indian exports - higher than rivals - and proposed to slap secondary sanctions, resulting in 50% tariff, citing India's purchase of arms and oil from Russia.

Banks widen home loan spreads to save margins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/psbs-widen-home-loan-spreads-to-save-margins/articleshow/123339715.cms,"MUMBAI: Banks are increasing their spreads over the home loan rate in a bid to protect their margins. SBI and Union Bank of India have widened the spreads on their mortgages over the reference rate as policy rates fall. The repo rate has already been cut by 100 basis points this year and could drop further. Unlike in the past, when lower rates flowed mainly to new borrowers while existing customers paid more, the present situation is reversed. New borrowers are seeing higher costs even as banks are obliged by RBI rules to pass on cuts to their existing customers.This asymmetry stems from sticky funding costs. Deposit rates are harder to bring down, especially for state-owned lenders with a large base of small savers who rely on fixed deposits. Margins have come under pressure, forcing banks to increase their spreads selectively. SBI's new home loan rates now range from 7.5% to 8.7%, 25 basis points higher than before, with weaker borrowers bearing the brunt. Union Bank has raised its rate to 7.45%, and more public-sector lenders are likely to follow.The move marks a strategic shift. Over the past few years, state-owned banks seized market share by undercutting private rivals.Between FY22 and FY25, SBI, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank grew their mortgage books faster than ICICI, HDFC Bank or Axis. Public sector lenders used their scale and branch networks to push mortgages at razor-thin spreads, often treating them as a gateway to cross-sell other loans and acquire deposits.That strategy is looking less sustainable. With lending rates falling and deposit costs sticky, home loans have turned into a drag on returns. For SBI, India's largest mortgage lender with Rs 8 lakh crore of home loans, even small changes in spreads have a meaningful impact on margins. According to a private sector bank executive, it is impossible to earn decent return on asset on a 7.3% home loan rate.Private banks, by contrast, have been reluctant to match the aggressive pricing of their public-sector peers. PSU banks grew faster, with SBI at 14% and both BoB and PNB at 18%. But this rapid expansion has to now contend with the reality of squeezed net interest margins. Industry-wide, the picture is cooling. Home loan growth slowed to 9.6% in the year to June 2025, down from 36.3% a year earlier.The decision by SBI and Union Bank to raise loan rates signals a recognition that the mortgage boom cannot be sustained at the cost of profitability. With policy rates likely to fall further, banks appear to be resetting strategy: protecting margins first, growth second. If others follow, the home loan market could be entering a new phase-less about cheap credit, more about sustainable returns.",SBI and Union Bank of India have widened the spreads on their mortgages over the reference rate.

Independence Day discounts gave India’s retail sector a much-needed boost, with footfalls and sales rising by 8-10% year-on-year across key shopping destinations.Industry executives say the revival in entry-to-mid segment demand has raised hopes of a strong festive season ahead.Electronics, particularly in affordable categories, along with groceries and apparel have seen healthy growth. Restaurants, too, are reporting higher sales as malls draw more visitors, helped by new film releases and a surge in in-home dining orders.“After several months, there is good demand for entry to mid-segment products,” Nilesh Gupta, director at electronic retail chain Vijay Sales told ET.“Walk-ins are good and there is over 8% jump in sales value over last year, which is better than last year,” he added.Electronics makers and grocery retailers ran promotional offers around Independence Day eve, one of the biggest consumption periods outside the festive and Republic Day seasons.At Reliance Retail, sales grew in double digits, according to an executive.Haier India president Satish NS told ET that the electronics manufacturer’s Independence Day sales were up more than 20% over last year, with “most categories driving sales.”On the ecommerce front, Tata-owned BigBasket reported a 42% on-year jump in patriotic merchandise sales on Friday, alongside strong demand for electronics, including the new iPhone 16.Malls also recorded a surge in traffic during the long weekend. Theatres are seeing back-to-back housefull shows for the first time since the pandemic, powered by Rajinikanth’s Coolie and Hrithik Roshan’s War 2.“The crowd that comes for the movie adds at least 10% of the revenue for fashion brands, food and beverages,” said Harsh V Bansal, cofounder of Unity Group, which operates more than six malls in Delhi and Punjab. “The next few days also look good in terms of footfall and sales,” he added.International labels have also drawn shoppers, with discounts prompting customers to buy at lower price points. “International brands have contributed to the growth with consumers using the lower price point during the sale to buy products,” said Muhammad Ali, chief executive, retail, at Prestige Group, which operates five malls in South India. Those malls have reported a 15% year-on-year rise in sales.“One segment which has not done well is Indian women’s wear, which is a cause of worry,” he told ET.Retailers and brands have been under pressure for nine to ten quarters as low-to-middle-income households grappled with high inflation and weak earnings growth. Higher spending on travel and tourism further dented retail demand.Executives, however, are forecasting a turnaround in the second half of the fiscal, supported by low inflation, soft loan rates, reduced income-tax slabs this year and good monsoon rains.“While middle class discretionary spending was under pressure, some consumption has started and with the festival tail wind, the outlook is much better,” Anjan Chatterjee, managing director of Speciality Restaurants told ET.He said that Independence Day demand trends have been “reassuring, with a 15-18% year-on-year growth.”The government on Friday also said GST rates will be rationalised by Diwali to boost consumption, improve affordability and make essential as well as aspirational goods more accessible to a wider base of consumers—moves expected to spur further demand.","Independence Day discounts gave India’s retail sector a much-needed boost.

Asian stocks mostly gained on Tuesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 (.N225) hitting a fresh all-time record high after US President Donald Trump extended a tariff truce with China for another 90 days, a move that eased trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies and steadied oil prices.The Nikkei jumped as much as 2.8 per cent, or 1,162.86 points, to 42,983.34 in the afternoon before easing back slightly, surpassing its previous record of 42,426.77 set in July last year. Heavyweight shares led the charge — SoftBank Group surged 7.07 per cent, Advantest climbed 7.34 per cent, Toyota gained 3.14 per cent, and Fast Retailing advanced 4.67 per cent. Analysts at IwaiCosmo Securities cited easing tensions over US-China trade talks and speculation over imminent US interest rate cuts as key drivers of the rally.The extension, announced Monday, staves off triple-digit duties on Chinese goods and removes one immediate risk for global markets. Trump signed an executive order delaying the planned tariff hike to allow more time for negotiations, with Beijing issuing a similar statement. Without the extension, tariffs on Chinese imports could have risen from an already steep 30 per cent.According to news agency Reuters, the truce had been largely expected by investors, who have also been buoyed in recent weeks by resilient US corporate earnings and prospects of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.Japan’s Nikkei was last up around 2 per cent as markets reopened after a long weekend, lifted by tech shares and tracking global gains.Australia’s benchmark index (.AXJO) also hit a record high ahead of a central bank policy meeting widely expected to deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut, with another possible by November.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was slightly higher, while China’s blue-chip CSI300 (.CSI300) was flat and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng (.HSI) dipped 0.1 per cent in early trade.“The US-China tariff truce extension preserves the status quo for now, so no immediate implications for investment markets,” Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney, was quoted as saying by Reuters.Oil prices also edged up as the trade extension eased concerns that escalating tariffs would weaken global economic growth and crimp fuel demand. Brent crude futures rose 26 cents, or 0.39 per cent, to $66.89 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) gained 22 cents, or 0.34 per cent, to $64.18, according to Reuters.Investors are also watching the August 15 meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, aimed at negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. “Any peace deal between Russia and Ukraine would end the risk of disruption to Russian oil that has been hovering over the market,” ANZ senior commodity strategist Daniel Hynes wrote in a note, cited by Reuters.Attention in financial markets will now shift to US consumer price inflation data due later Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect July’s core CPI to rise 0.3 per cent month-on-month, faster than June’s 0.2 per cent pace. “CPI will be a key test for market tone. Softer data could give small-caps a lift, but for now, mega-caps remain firmly in control,” said Marc Velan, head of investments at Lucerne Investment Management.Money markets, according to Bloomberg, are pricing in more than two Fed rate cuts by December, with about a 90 per cent probability of a quarter-point reduction next month.However, an upside surprise in inflation could temper those expectations.","Japan’s Nikkei 225 (.N225) hit a fresh all-time record high after US President Donald Trump extended a tariff truce with China for another 90 days.

India Should Put Out That It Wont Be Intimidated by Trump's 50% Tariff, Says South Asia Expert

Why SBI has stopped Nayara transactions

Russia-backed Indian refinery Nayara Energy is faced with a fresh challenge. India’s largest public sector lender State Bank of India ( SBI ) has stopped processing international trade and forex transactions for Nayara Energy following recent US tariff hikes. The bank's decision aims to avoid any potential sanctions from the US or the European Union, a source told ET. US President Donald Trump has announced a 25% additional tariff on India for its crude oil trade with Russia.Nayara Energy was formed after the Rosneft-led purchase of Essar Oil's Vadinar refinery (20 mtpa) in August 2017. The organisation sources crude oil internationally and holds approximately 8% of India's refining capacity, which exceeds 256 MMTPA, ranking second in Asia.The company maintains a nationwide network of more than 6,500 fuel retail outlets.Also Read | Symbol of India-Russia ties takes a hard hit!

US tariffs impact: Lenders weigh MSME relief; government drafts wider export support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-tariffs-impact-lenders-weigh-msme-relief-government-drafts-wider-export-support/articleshow/123251755.cms,"AI image

Lenders are exploring ways to ease the financial pressure on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) hit hardest by the United States’ 50% duty on imports from India.According to ET, lenders are considering scrapping certain administrative charges such as processing fees, foreign exchange hedging costs and collection charges after being nudged by the government.A government official cited by ET said that industry groups and export-oriented MSMEs had raised concerns, which were passed on to banks. “Banks have said they will provide options through these immediate relief measures,” the official said.While broad cuts in interest rates are unlikely without a government-backed subvention scheme, bankers indicated they may stop charging penal interest for missed repayment deadlines to prevent accounts from turning into bad assets.“Unless there is some sort of relief package announced, banks have limited scope to drastically bring down rates or offer systemic support,” an executive director of a state-run bank was quoted as saying by ET.The government, meanwhile, is working on a broader support plan under its proposed Export Promotion Mission. Measures being considered include customised schemes for affected sectors, redirecting exports to alternative markets, and pushing products with weak export demand into the domestic market.Exporters are also being urged to build strong Indian brands to withstand the tariff shock.Industry representatives have asked that penal interest on loans be applied only once accounts become non-performing, and that collateral requirements be aligned with the level of risk.One industry official noted that banks often refuse textile machinery as collateral, hampering loan access for textile exporters. Discussions are also underway on sector-specific credit lines with relaxed collateral rules and cheaper export factoring services.Currently, factoring services in Singapore are 10–11% cheaper than those in India, prompting many exporters to use them. MSMEs, which contribute heavily to India’s exports and employ millions, are seen as the most vulnerable to the tariff impact, particularly in sectors such as textiles.Another banker cited by ET said that they are advising clients to use the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTSME), which covers loans of up to Rs 10 crore per borrower. “We are actively pursuing this and, in some cases, handholding firms to get the Udyam registration to be eligible under the guarantee scheme,” the banker said.","Lenders are exploring ways to ease the financial pressure on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) hit hardest by the United States’ 50% duty on imports from India.

With the US set to impose steep new tariffs that industry executives say resemble the protectionist levies of the Great Depression era, Indian electronics exporters are scouting alternative markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.The move comes as the US, still the largest buyer of India’s electronics goods, becomes a tougher market, weighed down by tariff hikes and shifting content-origin rules. “I have been reaching out to my customers proactively. They are still issuing orders, but there are concerns about how this will pan out,” Sanjay Agarwal, managing director of Globe Capacitors, which exports about Rs 100 crore worth of materials annually to the US, was quoted as saying by ET.“I have already controlled my purchases, especially for the materials I buy only for US customers. As far as looking at alternative markets is considered, that is always on the horizon”, he added.While most electronics exports, including smartphones, currently remain exempt from both the 25% tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump and the additional 25% set to take effect from August 26, these exemptions are under review.They hinge on a US commerce department section 232 investigation mandated under the Trade Expansion Act, 1962, with findings expected in the coming weeks, according to ET.Rajoo Goel, secretary general of the Electronic Industries Association of India (ELCINA), said about 75–80% of India’s electronics exports are shielded from the new 50% tariff regime, but the remainder, including PCB assemblies, telecom gear, consumer products and power electronics, will feel the pinch. “For these products, our value addition is higher and would impact several domestic companies, including MSMEs,” Goel said, as per ET.US-bound electronics exports from India jumped 43.5% to $15.89 billion in FY25. Smartphones led the surge, accounting for $10.56 billion, up 89% from the previous year and made up 66% of all electronics exports to the US. “We are monitoring the situation closely and are looking at other markets for our products. For mobile phones, the Middle East and Africa are coming up as important destinations and for lighting, Europe is a market we are evaluating,” said an executive at an electronic manufacturing services (EMS) firm.Assembled photovoltaic cells (PVC) modules, the second-largest category, fell 32.7% to $1.81 billion in FY25 due to tighter curbs on imported units. Other exports included electronic instruments ($1.4 billion), computer hardware such as laptops ($154 million), and consumer electronics like cameras ($115 million).For the roughly $2 billion worth of electronics exports to the US beyond smartphones and PVC modules, there are ample alternative markets, according to Amrit Manwani, chairman of EMS major Sahasra Group. “Exporters should explore Europe, Australia, South East Asia, and given the geopolitical realignment, even Russia.Many firms may have to adapt and establish partial or full manufacturing in the US given its predominance as a market, if things don’t ease,” Manwani said. Another EMS executive was quoted as saying by ET that companies need to focus on “demand resilience” in addition to supply chain resilience.“Companies will have to look at other markets like the Middle East, Europe, Latin America and Africa. It is an opportunity for Indian companies to go beyond the US and deepen their presence in other countries as well,” the executive said.","US-bound electronics exports from India jumped 43.5% to $15.89 billion in FY25.

"Balcony solar trend in US gains momentum, plug-in kits offer cheaper option, demand seen rising as rooftop credits end",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/balcony-solar-trend-in-us-gains-momentum-plug-in-kits-offer-cheaper-option-demand-seen-rising-as-rooftop-credits-end/articleshow/123323615.cms,"Regulations, policy push

Affordability vs returns

When Oakland resident Terrence Dwyer got a flyer advertising a solar system small enough to fit on his deck — and that plugs into a regular wall socket — he didn’t hesitate. “Absolutely, let’s do this right away,” he said.Such “plug-in” or “balcony” solar kits, long popular in Europe for their affordability and easy installation, are now gaining traction in the US, AP reported. The momentum is expected to build as President Donald Trump’s budget package ends residential rooftop solar tax credits, potentially shifting interest to cheaper, smaller alternatives.Dwyer’s $2,000 setup — two 400-watt panels, an inverter, smart meter and circuit breaker — saves him about $35 a month on power bills. “We like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,” he said. A comparable rooftop system would have cost him $20,000 plus $30,000 in roof upgrades.US adoption has been slower than Europe’s due to patchy utility rules, low awareness and limited availability. Some utilities require the same interconnection paperwork as rooftop systems, despite plug-in models being designed to prevent power flowing back into the grid.In March, Utah became the first state to pass a law exempting small plug-in systems from interconnection agreements while mandating safety certification. Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the bill, said: “Europe has these things. You can go buy them and they work… there is no reason why we shouldn’t have them here.”California-based nonprofit Bright Saver, which sold Dwyer his kit, also offers a $399 model that sold out in six days. “The interest and demand have been overwhelming,” said co-founder Cora Stryker. Bright Saver and others are lobbying more states for supportive legislation.Experts say savings vary widely. UC Berkeley’s Severin Borenstein estimates a $2,000 US kit costs roughly $0.20/kWh over 25 years — viable mainly in areas with high utility rates. In Europe, where kits cost around $600, the equivalent rate is $0.05–$0.06/kWh.Baltimore engineer Craig Keenan installed a $399 Bright Saver kit on his balcony in July. “I’m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions we produce is unsustainable,” he said. It will save him about $40 annually and took just 15 minutes to set up.Texas-based Craftstrom has sold about 2,000 kits since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. China’s EcoFlow plans to enter Utah before expanding to other states. “This is an example of technology being ahead of regulators,” said EcoFlow’s Ryan Oliver.Analysts expect demand to accelerate as rooftop solar credits expire. “Utilities prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer,” said UCLA’s Robert Cudd. “Plug-in solar changes that.”","'plug-in' or 'balcony' solar kits are now gaining traction in the US. momentum is expected to build as President Donald Trump’s budget package ends residential rooftop solar tax credits.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 141 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1%, according to AP.Investor optimism has grown on expectations of a September rate cut, which could boost asset prices and spur economic activity by lowering borrowing costs for US households and businesses. However, lower rates also risk fuelling inflation. A weaker-than-expected US wholesale inflation report on Thursday trimmed some of the rate-cut optimism, but traders still largely expect the Fed to act. Treasury yields have retreated sharply in recent days and were steady on Friday.Economic data released Friday painted a mixed picture: US retail sales rose as forecast in July, manufacturing in New York state unexpectedly expanded, but nationwide industrial production fell, missing expectations for modest growth.Later in the day, a consumer sentiment report on inflation and the economy was awaited.On Wall Street, UnitedHealth Group soared 10.3% after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed the purchase of nearly 5 million shares in the insurer during the spring, valued at $1.57 billion. Berkshire Hathaway shares gained 0.2%.Applied Materials fell 12.5% despite posting quarterly results above analyst forecasts, as its revenue guidance for the current quarter disappointed investors. CEO Gary Dickerson cited a “dynamic macroeconomic and policy environment” creating uncertainty, particularly for the company’s China business. Sandisk dropped 4.9% after its upbeat quarterly profit was overshadowed by a weaker-than-expected profit outlook.In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.7% on stronger-than-expected GDP growth, while Shanghai gained 0.8% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 1% after data showed China’s economy slowed across key indicators in July, prompting calls for more policy support.ING Economics noted, “Chinese economic activity slowed across the board in July, with retail sales, fixed asset investment, and value added of industry growth all reaching the lowest levels of the year. After a strong start, several months of cooling momentum suggest that the economy may need further policy support.”European markets traded mixed ahead of a scheduled meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which could influence the direction of the war in Ukraine.In bonds, the 10-year US Treasury yield held at 4.29%, while the two-year yield slipped to 3.72% from 3.74%.","The S&P 500 was virtually unchanged in early trade, a day after notching a fresh all-time high.

"US retail sales up 0.5% in July as shoppers shrug off Trump tariffs; auto, online, furniture lead gains",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-retail-sales-up-0-5-in-july-as-shoppers-shrug-off-trump-tariffs-auto-online-furniture-lead-gains/articleshow/123323132.cms,"Photo credit - AP

Shoppers in the US kept up a healthy pace of spending in July, particularly at auto dealerships, even as President Donald Trump's tariffs began taking a toll on jobs and pushed some prices higher.Retail sales rose 0.5% last month, slowing from a revised 0.9% in June, according to the Commerce Department’s report released Friday. The July pace matched economists’ estimates. June’s figure had been revised upward, AP reported.The gains came after two straight months of declines — a 0.1% dip in April and a 0.9% fall in May. Excluding auto sales, which have been volatile since Trump imposed tariffs on many foreign-made cars, sales rose 0.3%. Auto sales jumped 1.6%, returning to more normal spending levels after a March-April surge, when buyers rushed to beat Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and parts, followed by a slump. Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the pattern reflected that early rush and subsequent slowdown.The report showed broad-based spending gains. Clothing store sales climbed 0.7%, online retailers gained 0.8%, and home furnishings and furniture stores rose 1.4%.Electronics store sales fell 0.6%, while restaurants — the lone services component in the Census Bureau report and a key discretionary spending gauge — slipped 0.4% as more shoppers opted to eat at home to cut costs.Spending resilience comes even as Trump’s tariffs slow hiring and raise prices. Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported US employers added just 73,000 jobs in July, far below the 115,000 expected, as trade policies rattled businesses and dented economic outlook.A separate government report Tuesday showed inflation was unchanged in July, with rising prices for some imports offset by cheaper gas and groceries. Consumer prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, matching June’s pace and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Core prices, excluding food and energy, rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June — both above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% in June, while core prices ticked up 0.3% from 0.2%. Slower rent increases and lower fuel prices appear to be offsetting some tariff effects. Many companies are still absorbing much of the added costs from Trump’s 10% universal tariff imposed in April and higher duties on countries including China and Canada.That could soon change. The Labor Department said Thursday its producer price index — measuring inflation before it reaches consumers — jumped 0.9% from June, the biggest monthly gain in over three years. Wholesale prices were up 3.3% from a year earlier, both figures exceeding forecasts.The data come as major retailers such as Walmart and Target prepare to release fiscal second-quarter earnings next week. Analysts will look for signs of how much of the tariff costs are being passed on to consumers and assess consumer sentiment ahead of the fall and winter shopping seasons.In May, Walmart warned that banana prices from Costa Rica had risen from 50 cents to 54 cents a pound and that more significant price impacts would emerge in June and July. Chief financial officer John David Rainey told The Associated Press he expected car seats from China priced at $350 could cost customers an extra $100.Several other companies, including Procter & Gamble, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Black & Decker, and Ralph Lauren, have told investors they have raised or plan to raise prices. Eyewear retailer Warby Parker is taking a selective approach, lifting prices only on premium products to offset tariff costs.Warby Parker has been reducing its reliance on China, targeting a year-end goal of keeping the share of goods sourced there under 15%. Still, the company faces higher tariffs from other countries.Executives said they plan to keep the $95 option but will increase prices for certain lens types, focusing more on older customers who need progressive lenses. Progressives, trifocals, and bifocals account for about 40% of prescription sales industrywide, but only 23% of Warby Parker’s business. These lenses are the company’s most expensive offerings and carry the highest margins.“We were able to quickly roll out select strategic price increases that have benefited our growth,” said Neil Blumenthal, co-chairman, co-founder, and co-CEO of Warby Parker.","Retail sales rose 0.5% last month, slowing from a revised 0.9% in June.

Asian stock markets showed a mixed performance on Friday, with strong Japanese growth figures offset by weaker Chinese data, while oil prices slipped ahead of a high-stakes US-Russia summit on Ukraine.As per news agency AFP, Japan’s economy expanded by 0.3% in the April-June quarter, surpassing forecasts, while the previous quarter’s output was revised upwards, helping the world’s fourth-largest economy avoid a technical recession.The growth came despite tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Japanese imports, including cars, an industry that provides around 8% of Japan’s jobs. The Nikkei 225 rose nearly 1% in morning trade, while markets in Shanghai, Seoul, and Sydney also edged higher.However, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped for a second straight session after China’s July retail sales and industrial production grew at a slower pace than expected.Reuters noted that the CSI 300 index erased early gains, reflecting ongoing concerns about China’s prolonged real estate slump, high youth unemployment, and weak consumer sentiment, pressures worsened by the US-China trade war.On Wall Street, stocks ended largely flat on Thursday after strong US producer price inflation dampened hopes of a larger interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve next month.“What it did was to get rid of all the chat about a 50 basis point cut,” said Mike Houlahan of Electus Financial, as quoted by Reuters.Markets are now pricing in a 92% chance of a quarter-point cut, with no expectations of a half-point move.Oil prices eased in Asian trade, reversing Thursday’s gains. According to AFP, traders are cautious ahead of Friday’s Alaska summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Stephen Schork of the Schork Group warned that a failed meeting could lead to “stronger sanctions on Russian oil, making it much more difficult for this oil to get to the market.”Key regional indices at 0230 GMT showed Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 up 0.9% at 43,036.46, Shanghai Composite up 0.3% at 3,675.05, Hang Seng down 1.1% at 25,236.62, and Brent crude slipping 0.1% to $66.76 per barrel.","Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the April-June quarter, surpassing forecasts.

Japan recorded modest economic growth in the April–June quarter, overcoming the pressure of steep US tariffs, official figures showed on Friday.Preliminary data from the Cabinet Office indicated that gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.3% from the previous quarter, outpacing market expectations of 0.1%. The January–March reading was also revised up to 0.1% growth from a previous estimate of contraction, avoiding what could have been a technical recession.On an annualised basis, the economy expanded 1%, higher than forecasts of 0.4% and following 0.6% growth in the prior quarter, reported news agency AFP.Economists polled by Reuters had anticipated a weaker performance, but robust exports, which contributed 0.3 percentage points to GDP after a sharp drop in Q1, helped support the uptick, according to CNBC. Japan’s trade deficit also narrowed in the second quarter.The improvement offers some relief to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose political future has been under strain after his coalition lost its majority in the upper house in July.“This is a welcome sign, but the economy still faces many downside risks,” said Yoshiki Shinke of Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, as quoted by AFP, cautioning that export volumes could come under pressure if automakers adjust pricing to offset tariffs.Japan’s auto sector, a key employer and export driver, has been hit by US duties of up to 27.5%. A recent trade agreement reduced the rate on cars to 15%, but the change has not yet taken effect. Toyota has warned of a $9.5 billion tariff impact this year, while Honda and Sony have scaled back their earlier loss projections.The Bank of Japan recently upgraded its 2025 fiscal growth forecast to 0.6% but warned that global trade tensions and weakening overseas economies could weigh on corporate profits.Analysts, including Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics, expect growth to slow in the coming quarters, with inflation pressures likely prompting the BoJ to resume tightening in October.","Japan recorded modest economic growth in the April–June quarter.

The long-term rate declined from 6.63% last week, while a year ago it averaged 6.49%, AP reported.Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, favoured by homeowners refinancing loans, also eased to 5.71% from 5.75% last week, compared with 5.66% in the June 2024 quarter, Freddie Mac said.Economists attributed the decline to a combination of market expectations and recent economic data. “Homebuyers who have been relegated to the sidelines by high financing costs got some encouragement in the past two weeks, but it remains to be seen if it’s enough to get more of them back in the game,” said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.Mortgage applications jumped 10.9% last week, largely driven by refinancing activity, which accounted for nearly 47% of all submissions and caused a 23% surge in total refi applications compared to the prior week—the strongest since April. Adjustable-rate mortgage applications rose 25% to their highest level since 2022, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported.The latest decline marks the fourth consecutive week of easing rates, bringing the average 30-year mortgage to its lowest level since October 24, when it averaged 6.54%.Mortgage pricing is influenced by the 10-year Treasury yield, which was at 4.29% midday Thursday, slightly up from 4.24% late Wednesday.The recent trend follows weaker-than-expected July US job data, which fuelled speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut its short-term interest rate next month. Analysts noted that a rate cut could stimulate the job market and broader economy but may also push inflation higher, a concern compounded by tariffs under President Trump’s policies.Economists generally expect 30-year mortgage rates to remain above 6% this year, though forecasts from Realtor.com and Fannie Mae suggest an easing to around 6.4% by year-end.The Mortgage Bankers Association reported a 10.9 per cent rise in mortgage applications last week. Most of the increase came from refinancing, which made up 47 per cent of all applications and surged 23 per cent from the previous week, marking the strongest refi week since April.

India & China Join Forces To Crush American Hegemony Amid Tariff War

US producer price inflation surged in July to its highest level since 2022, with fresh signs that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are driving up business costs, official data showed Thursday.The producer price index (PPI) jumped 0.9% month-on-month after being flat in June, according to the Department of Labor, AFP reported. The figure far exceeded the 0.2% rise forecast by Briefing.com analysts, pushing the annual PPI to 3.3%.Much of the increase came from services, which rose 1.1%—the biggest jump since March 2022—while goods costs climbed 0.7%. “The advance was broad-based in July, but more than three-quarters can be traced to services,” the Labor Department said, noting that trade services, a volatile category linked to wholesaler and retailer margins, drove much of the gain.Economists said the headline increase may be overstated by volatile components, but underlying price pressures are evident, particularly in goods exposed to tariffs. Trump’s 10% levy on most trading partners, along with steeper duties on sectors like steel and aluminium, has been squeezing margins.“Input costs for producers jumped in July as price pressures for businesses build from compounding tariff impacts,” said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide.“While businesses have assumed the majority of tariff costs increases so far, margins are being increasingly squeezed by higher costs for imported goods.”Ayers noted sharp recent price gains in steel and aluminium—both targeted with 50% levies—and in food products, which accounted for 40% of the goods price increase in July.Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, warned that “tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be beginning to wane.”For now, the effects on consumer inflation remain limited, with the consumer price index steady at 2.7% in July. But weaker-than-estimated hiring data has raised expectations of a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.Martin said the PPI figures “provide a counter-balance” to the softer employment numbers and underscore the Fed’s policy challenge. “The big picture remains that inflation is further away from the Fed’s target than the unemployment rate and is likely to climb further over the coming months. The path forward will have to traverse a tight rope between the next employment and price reports,” he added.","US producer price inflation surged in July to its highest level since 2022.

Wall Street retreated from record levels on Thursday after US government data showed wholesale inflation rose more than expected last month, dimming hopes for imminent interest rate cuts.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% from its all-time high set on Wednesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 104 points, or 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite eased 0.1% from its record in early trading, AP reported.The US Labor Department reported that prices at the wholesale level jumped 3.3% year-on-year in July, sharply higher than economists’ forecast of 2.5%. Analysts warned the increase could signal higher consumer prices ahead as costs filter through the economy.The hotter-than-expected data prompted traders to reassess expectations for a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. CME Group data showed a 5% probability the Fed could keep rates unchanged next month, compared to near-certainty of a cut a day earlier.“This doesn’t slam the door on a September rate cut,” said Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. “But it may raise a bit of doubt.”The inflation reading came after a more encouraging consumer price update earlier in the week. Separately, weekly jobless claims fell, signalling layoffs remain low despite tighter job openings. A resilient labour market could also give the Fed less incentive to cut rates in the short term.Treasury yields rose after the data, with the 10-year yield climbing to 4.26% from 4.20%.On the corporate front, Tapestry slumped 16.9% after the Coach and Kate Spade parent warned tariffs and duties could shave $160 million off annual profit.

US labour market data: Applications for jobless claims dip slightly; range below economists' forecast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-labour-market-data-applications-for-jobless-claims-dip-slightly-range-below-economists-forecast/articleshow/123305586.cms,"The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits edged down last week, remaining within historically low levels they’ve held since the economy clawed its way back from the COVID-19 slump.According to the Labour Department, applications for jobless claims for the week ending August 9 fell by 3,000 to 224,000.It was below the economists’ forecast of 230,000, according to AP reports.Weekly claims, a key indicator of layoffs, have largely stayed between 200,000 and 250,000 since the economy rebounded from the COVID-19 shock in 2020.The jobless benefits report showed that the four-week average of jobless claims inched up by 750 to 221,750, while the number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week ending August 2 dropped by 15,000 to 1.95 million.The latest data comes amid heightened political drama over the state of the US labor market.Two weeks ago, a disappointing July jobs report, showing only 73,000 jobs added, far below the 115,000 expected, triggered a sharp market sell-off.Revisions to May and June erased another 258,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. In response, US President Donald Trump fired Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) chief Erika McEntarfer, accusing her without evidence of manipulating the data.He has since nominated E.J. Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to lead the agency. The BLS does not produce the weekly jobless claims report, AP reported.Beyond the political shake-up, the numbers suggest a more challenging job market. Job openings fell to 7.4 million in June from 7.7 million in May, and the quits rate a gauge of worker confidence, dropped to its lowest since December.Major employers including Microsoft, Google, Meta, Starbucks, CNN, Intel, and Disney have all announced job cuts this year.Economists say the slowdown is being fueled partly by uncertainty over Trump’s trade policies, as his staggered tariffs on US trading partners have weighed on business expansion plans.Adding to the pressure, the new government data released on Thursday showed that US wholesale inflation jumped unexpectedly last month, signaling that the import taxes are driving costs higher.","Jobless claims for the week ending August 9 fell by 3,000 to 224,000.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS.

All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season.

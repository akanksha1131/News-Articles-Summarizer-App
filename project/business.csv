Budget 2026: Defence stocks in focus

Solar Industries

India Ltd

Solar Industries has emerged as one of the most visible private defence manufacturers, with products like loitering munitions (e.g., Nagastra) and advanced explosive systems gaining traction. Its subsidiary has signed MoD contracts (e.g., for Nagastra loitering munitions) under emergency procurement routes, demonstrating responsiveness to urgent capital allocations.

The company’s defense order book exceeds Rs175bn, with repeat orders for UAVs, grenades, and specialized ammunition.

Additionally, Solar Industries has secured international defense export contracts (~Rs14bn), highlighting both domestic and global demand for its products.

Implication: A higher capital budget and expansion of ammunition, loitering munitions, and counter-drone procurement strengthens Solar’s growth runway. A renewed focus on scale orders for guided rockets, precision munitions, and loitering systems directly feeds into Solar’s manufacturing portfolio.

Bharat Electronics Limited (

BEL

)

BEL benefits from sustained systems and electronics integration spending, with a strong order pipeline in radar, tactical communications, counter-drone systems, and C4ISR. A recent DAC package saw key approvals for BEL’s radars and communication systems.

The company is also expanding capability via new system integration facilities to capture complex defence electronics work, a strategic fit amid rising network-centric warfare spend.

Implication: BEL is positioned as a principal beneficiary of growth in C4ISR/ EW budgets, secure communications, and other electronics/system-integration heavy programs.

Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (

HAL

)

HAL remains central to aviation and aerospace modernisation, driven by fighter sustainment, upgrade packages, and helicopter inductions. While platform projects have long lead times, DAC approvals feed multi-year pipelines.

A higher capital pool can not only accelerate LCA and fighter support packages but also reinforce allocations for engine upgrades and sustainment for legacy fleets.

Mazagaon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL)

The Navy’s focus remains on submarines (e.g., Project-75(I)) and other surface platforms where long-lead commitments dominate. Project-75(I) aimed at procuring diesel-electric submarines, underscores MDL’s central role in the warship/submarine build pipeline.

Earlier DAC meetings (and defence stock market reactions) have reflected investor optimism around MDL as procurement approvals ripple through sector valuations.

Implication: A higher capital outlay supports staged awards for submarine and amphibious vessel projects, while steady allocations flow through extended execution horizons.

Budget 2026: We expect an inflection in India’s upcoming defence budget cycle, with core message being, capital outlay likely to grow faster than the overall defence budget, and the incremental funding would be channeled toward domestic procurement and modernisation-heavy programmes.The Defence Secretary in a FICCI forum recently highlighted that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is asking for a ~20% increase in capital acquisition budget for FY27e, described as the steepest single-year jump, explicitly prioritising domestic procurement.MoD has walked its talk by ensuring that majority of the domestic procurement is driven by DPSU’s + private players (YTD procurement from domestic players account for more than 65-70% threshold levels) rather than depending on imports.In parallel, the budget mechanics increasingly matter as much as the topline. Parliamentary scrutiny has highlighted that “Committed Liabilities” (payments due in a year for contracts signed earlier) take first charge on capital allocation, while “New Schemes” are fresh projects likely to be approved and contracted during the year, yet both are funded from the same Capital Acquisition (Modernisation) head.This is important because when committed liabilities are high, they “crowd out” new contracting even in a growing budget. Conversely, if MoD meaningfully raises the capital pool, then the system can service committed liabilities and accelerate new orders. If one looks at the funnel of projects that got cleared by the Defense Acquisition Council (DAC) in last 2-4 years, it reinforces our view that capital outlay will be on an increasing trend (and is often a key swing factor at the RE stage) and remains the principal lever for modernisation outcome.Who would get most of the highest allocation? Like previous years, expect the Indian Air Force (IAF) to get the highest allocation, followed by Indian Navy (IN).What does this mean for awarding in the next 12-24 months cycle? If the “capital-heavy + domestic-first” posture holds, then the awarding pipeline should be broad-based across the platforms, munitions, network-centric capabilities. Expect the biggest contracting momentum in (1) aircraft and helicopter fleets, (2) missiles/ rockets/ ammunition, (3) C4ISR / EW / space-enabled ISR, and (4) drones and counter-drone systems, segments where India has both urgency and growing domestic industrial base.On the aviation side, likely contracting themes include, sustainment-linked packages around fighter induction and upgrades, including LCA-related procurement (fighters, spares, support), aircraft/engine upgrade work, and rotary-wing inductions for Indian Army/ IAF/ IN (where indigenous content is rising). Given the urgency, won’t be surprised if awarding of the 114 Rafale order also forms part of the ‘New Schemes’ in FY27.On the missile and munitions side, the budget thrust should continue to favor scale orders for guided rockets, long-range rockets, air defence missiles, precision munitions, loitering munitions, and artillery ammunition, because these deliver immediate combat power, have relatively faster contracting cycles than major platforms, and fit the indigenisation narrative.From the IN point of view, while large shipbuilding programmes are multi-year and heavily “committed-liability” dominated, capital uplift can still translate into steady awards for P-75 (I) Submarine order, further platform upgrades, sensors, weapons fits, select new-build approvals.A particularly important “budget-to-orders” bridge in this cycle would be ISR and network-centric warfare. With contested borders, maritime chokepoints, and the need for rapid kill-chains, India is likely to keep prioritising C4ISR projects, covering satcom, surveillance satellites, ISTAR/ AEW&C enabling systems, tactical communications, electronic warfare, and secure data links, because these are force multipliers and align with domestic electronics and systems champions.The committed-liabilities framework supports this outlook as the big-ticket platform contracts (aircraft, ships) create multi-year payment obligations, MoD will typically seek a portfolio of “new schemes” that are modular, scalable, and can be ramped based on annual headroom, precisely how many ISR, EW, and drone programmes are structured. In short, implied signal of a higher capital allocation (and explicit emphasis on domestic procurement) makes it more plausible that multiple mid-to-large awards can be run in parallel, rather than serially queued behind legacy commitments.On the whole, the upcoming Indian defence budget outlook, would see “capital step-up” with at least a 15% increase. Where the structural reality of committed liabilities, would support of a multi-year award cycle, where the largest, fastest beneficiaries may likely be seen in missiles/ munitions, defence electronics (C4ISR/ EW), drones/ C-UAS, and select aviation/ helicopter procurement and upgrade packages, with shipbuilding likely to remain steady, constrained by long-duration payment schedules.","Solar Industries has emerged as one of the most visible private defence manufacturers.

New Delhi: With a focus on creating jobs in the private sector, the World Bank on Friday announced a new country framework for India with an annual support of $8-10 billion over the next five years, using its full range of instruments and mobilising private sector capital at scale.The new framework was unveiled after FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s meeting with the World Bank president Ajay Banga. “Leveraging public funds with private capital, creating more jobs across rural and urban India, and enriching projects with the (World) Bank Group’s global knowledge will be key to achieving sustainable impact at both speed and scale,” FM said in a statement.The World Bank Group’s global job strategy rests on three pillars: Investing in critical infrastructure, strengthening a business-friendly environment through predictable regulations and deploying risk-management tools to help private investment scale. The focus is on five sectors: Infrastructure and energy, agribusiness, health care, tourism, and value-added manufacturing.“Creating more jobs is at core of our work. This partnership brings together financing, reforms, and private sector investment to turn growth into opportunity for millions of Indians,” Banga said.Implementation will begin immediately with five ongoing projects, including PM Skilling and Employability Transformation through $830 million loan. The others include the second phase of Maharashtra Project on Resilient Agriculture and Kerala Health Systems Improvement Programme.","The new framework was unveiled after FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s meeting with the World Bank president Ajay Banga.

Rupee Slips Past 92 Mark Against Dollar As Equity Outflows, Dollar Demand And Market Fear Build Up

Mumbai: The rupee slipped to a record low in late trade on Friday, capping its worst monthly performance since Sept 2022, as persistent foreign portfolio outflows and strong corporate dollar demand continued to weigh on the currency despite intervention in the forex market.The rupee fell nearly 210 paise in Jan. The local unit touched an all-time low of 91.99 against the dollar during the session, and closed at 91.98, down two paise from its previous close of 91.96. Intervention by Reserve Bank of India helped the currency hold below the psychologically important 92-per-dollar level, though dealers said risks of gradual depreciation remain.Market pressure on the currency has been sustained by weak foreign capital inflows, elevated importer and corporate hedging demand, and strong dollar buying linked to bullion imports. Foreign investors sold about $4 billion worth of domestic equities in Jan, following nearly $19 billion of outflows last year.During the session, the rupee was caught between a firmer dollar and intervention, which limited the impact of weaker domestic equities. It traded at 91.95 per dollar in the first half, marginally stronger than the previous close, before slipping to its record low later in the day. In the international markets the dollar gained 0.4%.","Rupee slipped to a record low in late trade on Friday, capping its worst monthly performance since Sept 2022.

Growth, Inflation, Jobs Improve, But Risks Loom: What CEA’s Economic Survey Briefing Really Reveals

New Delhi: Economic Survey’s recommendation to amend the Companies Act to lower govt shareholding floor to 26% in state-owned companies, can help govt mop up higher non-tax capital receipts (revenues from disinvestments), the Centre’s top economist said Friday.“In all these years, govt was very clear that the markets are performing very well and it wanted to let the market capitalisation rise. The public sector’s stocks were doing even better than the general market indices and govt was also collecting dividends from good operating performance of the public sector entities. So, there was no immediate impulse from a revenue perspective (to disinvest),” chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran told TOI, elaborating on his suggestion to reduce govt stake in PSUs.“We are advocating this in future for the sake of augmenting non-tax capital receipts and also to look at the way we can impart some managerial efficiency in these sectors. So, it’s a solution we have put forward,” Nageswaran said.The suggestion came amid a poor privatisation record of the NDA govt, despite its policy to exit non-core areas and if accepted it can help the Centre dilute its stake in several listed entities where it currently holds just above 51%.There are at least half-a-dozen PSUs, where govt shareholding is just above the 51% threshold, with Centre’s hands tied in case of BPCL and Concor too (see graphic).There are suggestions from NITI Aayog as well as industry bodies such as CII for govt to step up disinvestment, especially privatisation, and use the resources for infrastructure development through further capital expenditure.Asked about private sector capex, which has been sluggish, CEA said visibility of demand and certainty of demand are important considerations for the private sector to invest and having a gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) to GDP ratio of 30-31% in the current scenario isn’t low. “How can pace (of private capex) be the same as it was between 2003 to 2008, when the world’s a different place right now? Data indicates that the private sector did invest reasonably well in 2024-25. ”Nageswaran also clarified that algorithms used by platform aggregators in the gig economy ecosystem have to take “human elements” into consideration. “We need to make sure that the way workers are assigned duties will have to take into consideration the human element, and it cannot be formulaic,” he said, while answering a query on the meaning of the algorithmic transparency that he has advocated in the Survey to promote worker-friendly practices in a bid to boost gig economy.","Economic Survey’s recommendation to amend the Companies Act to lower govt shareholding floor to 26% in state-owned companies, can help govt mop up higher non-tax capital receipts (revenues from disinvestments), top economist says. “We are advocating this in future for the sake of augmenting non- tax capital receipts and also to look at the way we can impart some managerial efficiency in these sectors,” V Anantha Nageswaran says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127812522,imgsize-8170,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2026-01-31-061149.jpg"
"Metal Meltdown: Silver, gold fall on profit taking, $ strength",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/metal-meltdown-silver-gold-fall-on-profit-taking-strength/articleshow/127812296.cms,".

.

Mumbai: Friday’s sharp slide in silver and gold prices could be due to profit taking by investors post an unprecedented rally that came on the back of the recent strengthening of the dollar against major currencies. For long term investors this could be a time to rebalance their portfolio, with exposure to the two precious metals at a maximum of 15%, fund managers and investment advisors said.In late trades on the MCX on Friday, silver future contracts for March delivery were trading at Rs 3 lakh/kg level, down by over Rs 1 lakh or 25%. Compared to the slide in white metal’s price, the slide in gold prices was less. Futures contracts for Feb delivery were trading at Rs 1.5 lakh/10gm, down Rs 15,200 or 9%. In the local bullion market, silver settled at Rs 3.45 lakh while gold was at Rs 1.66 lakh.“The main reason for the selloff was the strengthening of the US dollar, putting pressure on gold and silver prices. Investors also felt that the recent rally was stretched and unsustainable, leading to profit-booking at higher levels,” said Satish Dondapati, Fund Manager, Kotak Mutual Fund. “The fall was further supported by a technical correction, as prices had risen very quickly in a short period, making the market overheated.Despite Friday’s crash, in the last two years in the international markets, while gold prices are up 150%, silver is up 326%.Not surprisingly, fund managers and investment advisors say that long term investors should have up to 15% exposure to these two metals in their portfolio.“Expectations of US rate cuts have lowered the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold. Concerns around the AI-driven equity bubble in the US have also encouraged diversification into gold.” said Chintan Haria, Principal Investment Strategy, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund.According to Haria, while short-term corrections may be natural after sharp moves, the broader environment remains supportive over the medium term.“If you are sticking to the principles of asset allocation, together the exposure to gold and silver in your portfolio should be 5-10%,” said Jayant Manglik, partner, Fortuna Asset Managers.The strategy should be to book profits in silver first. Then rebalance the portfolio to a ‘neutral’ position by trimming the holdings in precious metals back to a safe haven level. Then “move harvested gains into diversified Indian equity funds or blue-chip stocks,” a recent report by WhiteOak Capital MF said.","Friday’s sharp slide in silver and gold prices could be due to profit taking by investors post an unprecedented rally.

When finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents her ninth budget on Sunday, she will also table the report of the 16th Finance Commission, headed by economist Arvind Panagariya, along with the action taken report. She will incorporate the recommendations of the panel in her budget.n What is a Finance Commission?It is a constitutional body set up every five years to review the fiscal position of states and the Centre, and decide the formula for sharing taxes collected by the Centre, known as vertical devolution. It also recommends the formula for the share for each state based on parameters. “Over the years, tax devolved to states by the finance commissions has been about 80% to 90% of the total finance commission transfers while grants have constituted 10% to 20% of such transfers,” according to a book released by the 15th Finance Commission (FC). While devolution has remained without conditions, grants in-aid come with conditions. Over the years, how much taxes are shared has changed. The first FC recommended 55% of the net income tax proceeds to be shared along with 40% of excise on tobacco, matches and vegetable products. Till 1999-2000, states only received a share of income tax and excise. It changed from 2000, when after amendments to the Constitution, the 11th FC began with devolution of all taxes, barring those raised through cess and surcharge.The FC also recommends transfers to the third tier of govt, or local bodies.n How do the commissions finalise their award?FC members travel to all states and get a first hand assessment of finances and challenges. They then devise the devolution formula based on several parameters. Over the years, population has been a key criteria along with a state. Besides, panels look at the income level and how the state compares with the national average, along with the fiscal situation of the state. The efforts taken by the state to manage its finances is also factored in.The 16th FC has not been given specific terms of reference, giving it complete freedom to decide on issues.n What are the issues confronting the 16th FC?How to deal with population is the biggest issue given that southern states have argued that they should not be penalised for better performance on this front. In addition, opposition-ruled states have argued that the Centre is not giving a fair deal to states, especially after GST was introduced, and there are multiple cesses, whose proceeds are not shared with them.On its part, several policymakers have argued that the states are walking away with a large share of revenue, leaving the Centre with limited resources, especially when it is supporting states on education, health and employment, which are not tasks assigned to it","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents her ninth budget on Sunday.

This is a defining moment in India's journey towards 'Viksit Bharat'. No country has become a developed nation living in isolation; it is through working with other countries, expanding markets, working on quality standards that investments flow. It was the silly myopic thinking that Congress-led UPA had, which we have done away with. EU FTA talks began 20 years ago, but they failed to do it for reasons best known to them, missing an opportunity that would have created lakhs of jobs, earned us billions of dollars, and helped in our country's prosperity.Because of their wrong policies. Instead of deals with developed nations, which would have been a win-win for us, they landed us up with agreements with our competitors, which are hurting the economy. They even threw us under the bus by negotiating with Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. We had FTA with Asean countries, Japan and South Korea, and we were negotiating with Australia and New Zealand. RCEP would have been an FTA between India and China. Just imagine what would have happened to India's growth story if that had happened. The 27 EU nations represent a huge market, which is now opening up for us, and we've been able to do that without compromising on anything. The reluctance was misplaced.You spoke of apples. We import six lakh tonnes of apples, and over 50,000 tonnes from the EU. We have given them a quota on apples with a minimum import price of Rs 80 a kg, and along with 20% duty or Rs 16, it will be Rs 96.Current protection for growers is Rs 50 MIP and 50% duty, which is Rs 25. The quota is less than what we are importing. We have protected our interests in automobiles. Due to UPA's stand, consumers were not getting a choice, we lost investments, which could have come to India for manufacturing. We have protected cars of up to Rs 25-30 lakh price, and the quotas are spread over 14 years. So, this reluctance was wrong. What we have done is a balanced, calibrated approach in every sector. This is a flawless deal.Every agreement stands on its own legs. We will negotiate and finalise every agreement based on what is good for India, create a win-win situation for India, create new job opportunities for Indians and create new business investment for Indians.Across FTAs that is going to be our strategy - To get the best deal with every country that we negotiate.It is applicable to all. We have got a forward most-favoured nation status. If they give any concessions, it's for all. There's already a Draghi report (a panel led by former Italian PM). It is talking of simplification and deregulation. We have protected our interests and ensured that verifiers will be approved in India and taxes paid in India will be recognised by Europe.Every country in Europe has welcomed it.No, it does not have to.With Japan and South Korea, we have not had any discussions on automobiles at all. With Korea, the review process has started, but because of frequent changes of govts there, it is a little slow. Asean review has started and it's progressing well.Everybody looks at their interests. If their interests are being served, they want to engage with India. I have been seeing this trend for past 3-4 years.Whenever we get a good deal, which is in national interest, we'll conclude. We are open to negotiating with all economies that believe in fair trade and fair play, don't hurt India's interests, and respect our sensitivities. We will move ahead wherever India gets a geopolitical, strategic and business advantage.Not at all. Every country looks after its own interests. We have to protect ours.Negotiations continue in a friendly manner.We are open to that. But as things stand, most of them are looking at alternative markets.These aren't the only markets and even with duties, many of these markets have opportunities. Many businessmen have already started factoring those in. By the time they do the groundwork, the agreements will start falling into place.We are engaged in discussions to find the right balance to make sure the domestic industry doesn't get hurt.An FTA is not just about tariffs. It is about predictability and certainty. It gives confidence to investors that if they invest in a country, their business will not get adversely affected by any change of policy. Therefore, every FTA leads to an increase in investment. A few months ago, a leading German firm got land in Dahej (Gujarat) within a space of days and is investing $1.5 billion. I had suggested to the CEO that the firm should hold a board meeting here, and they, I am pleased to tell you, held their first meeting here, their first outside Germany.I met them and was told that they are now setting up a large GCC for R&D in Hyderabad and also looking for land near a port for a chemical zone. This is the kind of opportunity that we can offer now, and there is enormous potential.Some anti-development politicians during their tenure as ministers failed India. There used to be so much difficulty in getting environmental approval during UPA. Either you paid an environment levy or you didn't get approvals. It is, to say the least, hilarious to see such people making these comments. I can assure you that the IPR chapter is a very robust chapter. It is aligned to our commitments under TRIPS. We have IPR chapters in the agreements with Switzerland and the UK, and everybody has seen those chapters. Nobody has ever found a single fault.","India has given up its reluctance to lower tariffs for automobiles, wine and, even for some fruits such as apples and pears. Cereals, pulses, genetically modified food, dairy, are all out. India has offered concessions to British and European automobiles. We have protected our interests in automobiles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127813676,imgsize-73800,width-400,resizemode-4/union-minister-of-commerce-and-industry-piyush-goyal.jpg"

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

GST Reforms: Supporting Working Capital, Export Facilitation, Procedural Clarity

Customs Reforms: Rate Rationalization, Amnesty scheme and Procedural Reforms

Conclusion

(Harpreet Singh is Partner, Deloitte India. With contribution from Gagan Gugnani, Director, Deloitte India)

As Union Budget 2026 approaches, economic policymaking has been unfolding against a challenging global backdrop. Slowing trade growth, supply chain realignments, inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainty continue to influence investment and production decisions worldwide. In this environment, India’s fiscal and tax policy choices will play a crucial role in sustaining growth momentum and enhancing resilience of the domestic economy.Indirect tax measures are central to this effort. Beyond revenue considerations, they directly affect cost structures, operational efficiency, and the ability of businesses to operate seamlessly across domestic and international markets. Expectations from the forthcoming Budget therefore center on simplification, certainty, and targeted relief measures that actively support economic activity.The 56th GST Council meeting marked an important milestone on the simplified two-rate structure, signaling the government’s intent to make the GST regime more stable and transparent. Building on this, Budget 2026 is expected to advance structural reforms to strengthen liquidity, reduce compliance bottlenecks, and improve the overall business environment.Working capital pressures have intensified, particularly for sectors impacted by rate rationalization. There is a strong expectation that the inverted duty structure (IDS) refund mechanism will be extended to input services and capital goods. Further, permitting provisional sanction of up to 90% of eligible IDS refund would significantly alleviate liquidity constraints. This is crucial as several goods have migrated to the 5% GST slab, resulting in accumulation of input tax credit where procurements attract higher tax rates.Cross-border service providers have also faced uncertainty on intermediary services, with divergent interpretations of the place of supply provisions triggering litigation, estimated at over INR 3,357 crore as per the 55th GST Council meeting. A legislative amendment aligning the intermediary framework with the general place of supply rules would help curtail disputes and offer much needed clarity to service exporters.Process rationalization is another cornerstone of GST reforms. Post-supply discounts continue to pose interpretational challenges. Aligning GST provisions to recognize commercial discount arrangements, irrespective of whether they are agreed before or after the time of supply and dispensing with the requirement of invoice-wise correlation for post-supply discounts have been a long-standing demand of India Inc. Legislative amendments to address these concerns is awaited.Customs policy continues to play a defining role in India’s trade and manufacturing ecosystem. In the prevailing global environment, characterized by muted demand and rising cost pressures, calibrated reductions in input tariffs can provide immediate cost relief and support manufacturing competitiveness, particularly for export-oriented industries.Although incremental rationalization has been initiated, the Customs tariff structure remains intricate, with multiple duty rates and frequent amendments contributing to classification disputes and elevated compliance costs. Further simplification of duty slabs would enhance certainty and reduce administrative complexity.Resolution of legacy Customs disputes is another critical area of focus. Introduction of a structured amnesty or dispute resolution scheme could help unlock blocked capital, reduce litigation, and enable businesses to redirect resources towards expansion and investment. Complementary procedural enhancements such as expeditious Special Valuation Branch clearances, deeper digitization, and time-bound adjudication would further strengthen trade facilitation and lower transaction costs.Budget 2026 offers an opportunity to strengthen India’s trade and tax framework through targeted, practical reforms. Streamlined Customs duties, resolution of legacy disputes, expanded IDS refunds, and procedural clarity in GST can collectively reduce costs, ease working capital pressures, and improve predictability. These measures would enhance domestic competitiveness, support exports, and signal India’s intent to be a reliable and business-friendly destination in a challenging global environment.","Budget 2026 offers an opportunity to strengthen India’s trade and tax framework through targeted, practical reforms.

Who is Kevin Warsh?

NEW DELHI: US president Donald Trump on Friday announced Kevin Warsh as his nominee for chairman of the US Federal Reserve, setting the stage for a contentious Senate confirmation process amid growing debate over the central bank’s independence.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, "" I am pleased to announce that I am nominating Kevin Warsh to be the CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. Kevin currently serves as the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics at the Hoover Institution, and Lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He is a Partner of Stanley Druckenmiller at Duquesne Family Office LLC. Kevin received his A.B. from Stanford University, and J.D. from Harvard Law School. He has conducted extensive research in the field of Economics and Finance. Kevin issued an Independent Report to the Bank of England proposing reforms in the conduct of Monetary Policy in the United Kingdom. Parliament adopted the Report's recommendations. Kevin Warsh became the youngest Fed Governor, ever, at 35, and served as a Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2006 until 2011, as the Federal Reserve's Representative to the Group of Twenty (G-20), and as the Board's Emissary to the Emerging and Advanced Economies in Asia. In addition, he was Administrative Governor, managing and overseeing the Board's operations, personnel, and financial performance. Prior to his appointment to the Board, from 2002 until 2006, Kevin served as Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and Executive Secretary of the White House National Economic Council. Previously, Kevin was a member of the Mergers & Acquisitions Department at Morgan Stanley & Co., in New York, serving as Vice President and Executive Director.

He began his career in investment banking at Morgan Stanley, where he worked in the mergers and acquisitions division.The nomination comes days after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady under current chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump again criticised, calling him a ""moron"". Trump had said he would announce his pick after the rate decision, as months of attacks on Powell have raised concerns among investors about political pressure on the central bank. US media reports said Warsh emerged ahead of other contenders, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder and Trump’s economic adviser Kevin Hassett.In recent years, Warsh has criticised the Fed for moving into political territory and argued that its policy choices have constrained economic growth. He has publicly supported interest rate cuts to boost the economy, even as Fed officials have cautioned about inflation risks, including those stemming from Trump’s tariff policies.Warsh’s appointment will require confirmation by the US Senate. The Senate Banking Committee will first review the nomination, followed by a full Senate vote.

Space-based data centers and AI strategy

SpaceX IPO could be largest in history

SpaceX is exploring potential mergers with Tesla Inc or artificial intelligence startup xAI, as Elon Musk considers ways to consolidate his growing business empire.The aerospace company has held internal talks about the feasibility of a SpaceX–Tesla merger, an idea that some investors are actively encouraging, reported Bloomberg, citing sources. Separately, SpaceX is also evaluating a possible combination with xAI ahead of a potential initial public offering.No final decisions have been made, and the details of any transaction could still change.Any merger involving SpaceX could draw strong interest from infrastructure funds and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, according to people familiar with the matter. One source noted that a deal could also require a significant financing component.Different merger structures could support Musk’s broader vision for SpaceX, including placing data centers in orbit to handle advanced artificial intelligence computing.A merger between SpaceX and xAI could allow the AI company to leverage space-based computing capacity, if the technical challenges can be overcome. SpaceX has discussed the possibility of using satellites and orbital infrastructure to support large-scale AI workloads.Tesla could also play a role in this strategy. The electric vehicle maker’s energy storage systems may help power space-based data centers using solar energy. Musk has additionally discussed using SpaceX’s Starship rockets to transport Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robots to the Moon and Mars.Following reports of the potential merger discussions, Tesla shares rose as much as 4.5% in after-hours trading on Thursday. The stock had declined 3.5% during regular trading, leaving Tesla with a market capitalization of approximately $1.56 trillion.Bloomberg News has previously reported that SpaceX is targeting an IPO valuation of around $1.5 trillion, potentially placing it among the most valuable companies in the world.According to Nevada business records, two legal entities containing the phrase “merger sub” were formed on January 21. Both entities list SpaceX Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen as an officer, a move often associated with merger preparations.Reuters previously reported on a potential SpaceX–xAI merger, under which xAI shares would be exchanged for SpaceX stock. Some xAI executives may be offered cash in lieu of equity, according to people familiar with the proposal.SpaceX is considering a public listing as early as June, around Elon Musk’s birthday, and could seek to raise up to $50 billion, sources have said. If completed, the offering would be the largest IPO in history.Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley are expected to serve as lead underwriters. Robinhood Markets is also seeking a role in the IPO, Bloomberg News reported.In December, CFO Bret Johnsen told employees that a SpaceX IPO would help fund an “insane flight rate” for the company’s Starship rocket and support plans for a permanent Moon base.","The aerospace company has held internal talks about the feasibility of a SpaceX–Tesla merger.

Asian markets are mostly down on Friday as concerns about AI investments grow. Tech stocks took a hit, while gold and silver prices dropped from their record highs. Oil prices also fell as tensions between the US and Iran showed signs of easing. The market's ups and downs this week were influenced by various factors, including a weaker dollar and Donald Trump's threats against Iran.The tech sector's earlier optimism about AI, boosted by strong earnings from Meta, Samsung, and SK hynix, took a downturn after Microsoft's announcement. The company revealed plans to increase AI infrastructure spending, which worried investors about delayed returns on investment. This news had a significant impact on Microsoft's stock.""Microsoft suffered its worst session since the Covid‑era crash, falling 12 percent and accounting for over two‑thirds of the S&P 500's decline,"" said National Australia Bank's Rodrigo Catril, as quoted by AFP.

The slight increase in the dollar value contributed to this decline, despite Trump's apparent comfort with a weaker US currency.Oil markets remained volatile, with prices falling more than 1% after Thursday's 5% surge. This came as Trump warned Iran about possible strikes while sending military forces to the region. However, fears persist about potential conflicts in the oil-rich area, which could drive up prices and inflation.The overall market sentiment reflects caution about tech valuations and concerns about possible market bubbles, as stocks have reached record highs in recent years largely due to tech sector growth.","Asian markets are mostly down on Friday as concerns about AI investments grow.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 162 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.6%, weighed down by losses in large technology stocks, AP reported.Technology shares drove much of the divergence. Microsoft slumped 10.4% despite reporting stronger-than-expected profit and revenue for the latest quarter. Investors instead focused on the company’s rising capital expenditure, concerns over the pace of growth in its Azure cloud business, and uncertainty around how quickly its artificial-intelligence push will translate into sizeable profits.Helping to offset that drag was Meta Platforms, which jumped 8.6% after beating profit expectations, even as it signalled continued heavy investment in AI.Elsewhere, Tesla traded lower by 0.7% after an initially positive reaction to its results.While the automaker posted profits above estimates, earnings were sharply lower than a year earlier. Chief executive Elon Musk urged investors to look beyond weak car sales and focus on longer-term bets such as robotaxis and robotics.IBM rose 7.1% after topping profit and revenue forecasts, while Southwest Airlines surged 9.7% despite missing profit estimates, after issuing a strong outlook for 2026 driven by operational changes such as baggage fees and assigned seating. On the downside, ServiceNow slid 9.2% even after delivering better-than-expected quarterly profits, as investors continued to trim positions following a strong run earlier in the year.The most dramatic moves were again seen in commodities.

Toyota car sales climb despite US trade tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/toyota-car-sales-climb-despite-us-trade-tensions/articleshow/127767517.cms,"Japanese auto giant Toyota said on Thursday that global sales hit a new record last year, despite trade tensions, as it retained its title as the world's top automaker and widened the gap with German rival Volkswagen.Sales, including those of subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino Motors, rose 4.6 percent to 11.3 million vehicles, the company said.That far outstripped Volkswagen's total of 8.98 million vehicles, which was down 0.5 percent from the year before.The overall increase came despite flat sales for Toyota in China, a crucial market where it faces intensifying competition from local automakers including electric-car champion BYD.US sales climbed eight percent in spite of the 25 percent tariff on Japanese auto exports imposed by Washington between April and mid-September, when a 15 percent cap kicked in.The United States is a key market where Toyota generates almost a quarter of its sales. But of the 2.52 million vehicles it sold there in 2025, only 1.39 million were produced in the country.Even so, it last year increased output by 10 percent at its factories in the United States, where it produces its increasingly popular hybrid vehicles.To keep exporting to the United States on competitive terms, Japanese automakers have had to slash prices.In early November, Toyota estimated the impact of US duties on its annual operating profit at around 1.45 trillion yen ($9.5 billion).Other Japanese automakers, meanwhile, are taking a hit.Nissan, which is in serious financial difficulty, saw sales drop 4.4 percent to 3.2 million vehicles in 2025, with a 6.3 percent collapse in its flagship Chinese market.Honda reported an almost nine percent plunge in global sales, to 3.4 million vehicles.","Sales, including those of subsidiaries Daihatsu and Hino Motors, rose 4.6 percent to 11.3 million vehicles.

It was the second year in a row of steep declines. The drop came despite the introduction of cheaper models and Musk's promise to remain laser-focused on the company after a foray into US politics.Still, Tesla investors have kept the faith in Musk. The stock is up 9 per cent in the past year.Musk has been urging investors to focus less on car sales and more on what he considers a bright new artificial intelligence future of robotaxis ferrying millions in cars without drivers, or even steering wheels, and robots watering plants and taking care of elderly parents.On a conference call, Musk underlined that shift by announcing Tesla had decided to close down production of two older car models, S and X, in the second quarter and convert a Fremont, California, factory to produce its Optimus robots instead.Making those future ambitions a reality will take money. Officials said Tesla would spend big on AI and others new projects this year, more than doubling capital expenditures to USD 20 billion.And the company revealed it had recently invested USD 2 billion in the artificial intelligence company xAI, raising potential conflicts of interest issues as Musk holds big stakes in both companies.That AI business, known for its Grok AI assistant, has courted controversy for echoing Musk's views on race, gender, and politics and, recently, producing nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images.Tesla's fourth quarter profit also fell sharply, dropping 61 per cent to USD 840 million, or 24 cents. But excluding one-time charges, net income totalled 50 cents per share, compared to analysts' forecasts of 45 cents.""They've got aging product that is less and less competitive as other manufacturers come out with new models, then there is the general brand destruction,"" said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid. ""Musks involvement in politics has turned off customers.""There were hopeful signs in the report, too. Tesla's energy storage business, though small compared to the car sales, posted strong numbers last quarter with revenues surging 25 per cent to USD 3.8 billion reflecting demand from new datacentres sucking up energy around the US.Tesla's gross profit margins were another bright spot, leaping to 20 per cent last quarter from 16 per cent a year ago.""Tesla's ability to show improving profitably was a surprise,"" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.Goldstein said he was also encouraged by plans outlined in Tesla's earnings report to roll out robotaxi service in Houston, Miami and five other cities in the first half of this year. In the conference call, the company also said that it would begin producing its two-seated Cybercab with no wheels or pedals in the same time frame.But Musk is well know for making promises with deadlines he never meets.Musk said that European regulators would approve its partial self-driving software in the first three months last year, a potential big boost to Tesla sales there. But that hasn't happen yet. And a strong revival in sales Musk heralded midway through the year also failed to materialise.The robotaxi program has progressed slowly, which Musk told investors is due to Tesla being extremely cautious to avoid mishaps.Tesla promised robotaxi rides without anyone driving the car, but until recently the cars had supervisors inside to grab the controls in case something went wrong. Tesla has now removed the safety drivers in Austin where it launched the service in June.For some on Wall Street that is enough to keep pushing the stock up.One of Wall Street's most bullish analysts, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, expects robotaxis will be in more than 30 cities by the end of this year, and that Tesla will capture 70 per cent of the global market for self-driving cars in a decade.Ives and others are also encouraged that Musk has shifted his focus back to the company after spending months as head of a government cost-cutting team in Washington.But it's not clear his attention will remain as undivided in the new year. He has plans to take his rocket company SpaceX public, possibly in June, in what many expect to be a blockbuster IPO that make him the world's first trillionaire - but also possibly distract him.",Tesla's annual profit plunged to its lowest level since the pandemic five years ago.

Tether is shaking up gold market with massive metal hoard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tether-is-shaking-up-gold-market-with-massive-metal-hoard/articleshow/127749392.cms,".

There are roughly 370,000 nuclear bunkers in Switzerland, a legacy of the Cold War that are now rarely used. One of them, though, is a hive of activity.Every week, more than a ton of gold is hauled in to the high-security vault, owned by crypto giant Tether Holdings SA, which is now the world’s largest known hoard of bullion outside of banks and nation states. Over the past year, Tether has quietly become one of the biggest players in the global gold market — the embodiment of a meeting of the crypto and gold worlds whose shared distrust of govt debt is a major factor behind the surge in prices to never-before-seen highs above $5,200 an ounce.And yet relatively little is known about its inner workings, or its gold strategy. When two of the most senior gold traders quit leading bullion bank HSBC Holdings last year, the industry was abuzz with gossip about where they would head next; few guessed that the answer was Tether.In an interview with Bloomberg, chief executive Paolo Ardoino described the company’s role in the gold market as similar to that of a central bank, and predicted that Washington’s geopolitical rivals would launch a gold-backed alternative to the dollar.He revealed that it plans to keep ploughing its enormous profits into gold, while also beginning to compete with banks in trading the metal.“We are soon becoming basically one of the biggest, let’s say, gold central banks in the world,” he said.Even in these historic times for the gold market, Tether’s activities stand out. It has rapidly stepped up its purchases, buying over 70 tonnes of gold over the course of last year for its reserves and its own gold stablecoin, according to a Bloomberg calculation. That’s more than was reported by almost any single central bank: only Poland, which added 102 tonnes to its reserves, made larger declared purchases. It is also more than what was bought by any but the three largest exchange-traded funds, which represent the collective activity of tens of thousands of individual traders and investors.Tether holds around 140 tonnes of gold, according to Ardoino, most of which are its own reserves, along with the bullion backing its own gold token. That amount of metal is worth $24 billion, the largest known hoard outside of those held by central banks, ETFs and commercial banks whose vaults underpin the main trading hubs. Ardoino said Tether had been buying at a rate of about one to two tonnes a week, and intended to continue doing so for “definitely the next few months. ”Tether makes money from its dollar stablecoin that is the giant of the sector, with $186 billion in circulation. The company takes in real dollars in exchange for that USDT token, and invests them in Treasuries and other assets, such as gold, raking in billions in interest and trading profits.Possessing the physical metal is crucial, Ardoino said, so much so that the company has taken the unusual step of storing the bullion itself in the former nuclear bunker in Switzerland, guarded by multiple layers of thick steel doors. “It’s a James Bond kind of place,” Ardoino said.The secretive nature of the gold market means that while it’s easy to describe broad drivers of investment, it can be hard to pinpoint who exactly is buying. China, for example, officially disclosed just 27 tonnes of purchases last year, but many traders believe it bought much more.Such is the scale of Tether’s disclosed purchases, that some market watchers have pointed to their role in shifting global prices. The purchases likely contributed to gold’s 65% rally last year, analysts at Jefferies Financial Group said in a note, describing Tether as a “significant new buyer” which “could drive sustained gold demand.”"," crypto giant Tether Holdings SA is now the world’s largest known hoard of bullion outside of banks and nation states.

The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged, holding its benchmark lending rate at 3.5% to 3.75%.The decision was not unanimous. Governors Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran dissented, favouring a quarter-point rate cut.The decision comes after the central bank cut rates at three consecutive meetings late last year. Fed officials have said they want time to see how those cuts affect the economy before considering any further reduction, signalling that rates could stay on hold for the next few months.The pause was widely expected. While concerns over a slowing labour market had earlier pushed the Fed to cut rates, recent economic data has been more mixed. Growth has been stronger than expected, unemployment remains low, and inflation continues to stay above the central bank’s comfort level.The Fed’s cautious approach comes amid renewed political pressure. President Donald Trump has repeatedly argued that interest rates should be cut more aggressively. Since returning to office last year, he has stepped up criticism of the central bank, drawing warnings from officials about the need to protect its independence.Trump has called for the removal of Fed Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, and his administration has launched an inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over renovations at the central bank’s headquarters.Earlier this month, Powell responded strongly to the criticism, warning against threats of criminal prosecution and raising concerns about whether monetary policy decisions could be influenced by political pressure.","US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, holding its benchmark lending rate at 3.5% to 3.75%.

US Dollar’s ‘Worst Day’ As Trump DUMPS Concerns Over Currency Decline | ‘Can Control It Like Yo-Yo’

What are ' Trump accounts '?

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday launched a new federal investment programme for newborns, with the White House saying over 500,000 families have already enrolled. The initiative aims to help children build long-term savings and address affordability concerns for American families.The investment accounts, named after Trump are being set up for babies born over a three-year period and include an initial government contribution. The move comes as the Trump administration and the Republican Party seek to address rising affordability concerns ahead of the November midterm elections, according to Reuters.The accounts were created last year under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the administration’s flagship tax and spending legislation.Under the scheme, the US Treasury will deposit $1,000 into investment accounts for all children born between 2025 and 2028. Officials estimate that around 25 million families will be eligible for the benefit.The government is also encouraging families to make additional contributions to the accounts. Some private investors have already stepped in, including entrepreneur Michael Dell and his wife Susan, who have committed a combined $6.25 billion to the programme.Speaking at a White House event in Washington to launch the accounts, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the initiative was designed to address gaps in savings among American families.She said if families contribute the maximum $5,000 each year, the account will accumulate almost $1.1 million by the time the newborn turns 28.The Trump administration is also promoting the programme as a bipartisan effort rather than a partisan policy.“It’s not about red or blue politics,” Cheryl Hines, an actress and the wife of Health Secretary Robert Kennedy, said at the event.Despite the rollout, public awareness of the programme remains limited. A poll by Exclusive Public First found that 57 per cent of Americans had never heard of a Trump account, while another 25 per cent said they were aware of it but could not explain how it worked, Politico reported. Only 14 per cent of respondents said they had heard of the accounts and could explain them.Trump accounts are federally supported investment accounts designed to help US children build savings from birth through long-term investing.Under the scheme, each eligible child receives a one-time government deposit of $1,000 into an account opened in their name, with parents or guardians acting as custodians until the child turns 18, according to ET.Money in the accounts is required to be invested in low-cost index funds largely tracking US companies. The funds remain locked in until adulthood, after which the account converts into an individual retirement account (IRA).Families, employers and other contributors can add up to $5,000 annually, while employer contributions of up to $2,500 are exempt from being treated as taxable income. Withdrawals are governed by standard IRA rules, with limited allowances for specific purposes such as education, buying a first home or starting a business.The administration said that the initiative brings together government support, private participation and household savings to strengthen long-term financial security for future generations.","Trump accounts are federally supported investment accounts designed to help US children build savings from birth through long-term investing.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

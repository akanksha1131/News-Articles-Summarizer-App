Market players also pointed out that foreign funds turned net sellers in Indian stocks for the first time in more than three weeks.

MUMBAI: The rupee recovered sharply on Friday to close at 85.37 against the dollar after touching an intraday low of 85.85, helped by dollar sales from public sector banks acting on behalf of the RBI. The domestic currency closed at 85.71 in the previous session.Despite the late recovery, the rupee posted its steepest weekly decline in recent weeks, losing nearly 1% as geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan rattled investor sentiment and triggered outflows from sovereign bonds. The conflict between the two neighbours intensified, with both sides reportedly deploying drones and artillery for the third straight day, marking the worst escalation in nearly three decades.While analysts believe both countries have a fundamental incentive to avoid large-scale escalation in the medium term, they also flagged the high level of uncertainty surrounding geopolitical developments.The mounting tensions hurt domestic equities, with the Nifty 50 falling over 1% on Friday. Govt bonds, which dipped early in the session, later recovered. Offshore markets reflected growing nervousness, as one-month dollar-rupee non-deliverable forwards rose to a one-month high.","The rupee posted its steepest weekly decline in recent weeks, losing nearly 1%. geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan rattled investor sentiment and triggered outflows from sovereign bonds.

Vague war clauses cloud IPL cover,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vague-war-clauses-cloud-ipl-cover/articleshow/121046800.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

MUMBAI: The suspension of IPL - India's most heavily insured sporting event - has brought renewed scrutiny to the utility and limits of event insurance amid geopolitical tensions.Howden, the insurance broker to the BCCI, acknowledged the suspension and said it would wait for an official decision on cancellation or rescheduling. ""Match cancellations are complex and dynamic, and speculating is not in the best interest,"" the firm said.IPL 2025 already saw a sharp rise in premiums following Rs 50 crore in weather-related claims last season. Reinsurance support dwindled, with just 20-30% of structured risks being transferred.The recent JioStar merger reshaped demand patterns, prompting broadcasters to reduce their coverage. While policies typically cover cancellation, adverse weather, unrest, and injuries, they are triggered only by outright cancellation or abandonment, not temporary suspensions - leaving policyholders exposed to short term halts.""For a claim to be triggered, the event should either get cancelled or abandoned. Currently, IPL has been suspended for a week owing to the current situation at the border. The organiser can always commence the event at a later stage once things normalise. A similar situation happened during Covid 2021, wherein IPL was suspended, and after a few months, it commenced and successfully concluded,"" said Amit Agarwal, CEO of Howden Broking The pressing question is whether insurers may treat the disruption as a war event. Most policies, except marine cargo, exclude war-related risks as they fall under force majeure - events deemed uninsurable. If applied, even routine claims, such as for travel cancellations, could be denied. Besides IPL, corporates are delaying product launches and conferences as international guests are avoiding them due to advisories.""Event cancellations in the current scenario should be treated as insured events until declared otherwise. Coverage can be broad on paper, including cancellations and suspensions,"" said Anup Dhingra, MD, FINPRO, IMEA. Rushik Patel of Edme Insurance Brokers said the key complication lies in the vagueness of war clauses.","IPL 2025 already saw a sharp rise in premiums following Rs 50 crore in weather- related claims last season.

Satellite communication companies need to pay 4% fee on revenue: Trai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/satcom-companies-need-to-pay-4-fee-on-revenue-trai/articleshow/121046567.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Telecom regulator Trai on Friday recommended a charge of 4% of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) for satellite communications operators, such as Elon Musk's Starlink, Bharti Enterprises-backed OneWeb and Jio-SES, and said the companies should be assigned spectrum for a period of five years, that can be extended by another two years.The regulator also proposed charges on satcom companies when acquiring customers in urban areas, while recommending subsidy for installation in dark zones, within rural and remote areas to encourage faster network enhancement.The long-awaited recommendations clear one more hurdle for Starlink and other satcom providers after revised guidelines issued by the department of telecom (DoT) recently, and issuance of Letter of Intent to Musk's company earlier this week.The AGR comes after govt decided to provide spectrum for satcom providers on an administrative basis, against auctions that are mandated for terrestrial service providers, such as Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel & Vodafone Idea.Trai did not fix any specific price for the airwaves as was being demanded by Jio and Airtel. The domestic terrestrial providers were pushing the govt for ""comparable"" spectrum pricing for satcom providers to ensure ""fair competition"" in the telecom sector and to drive in a ""level-playing field"".Trai chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti said the regulator did not find any case of satellite services eating into the broader business model of the terrestrial providers. ""After detailed examination, we have found that satellite services will be complementary and not competing,"" Lahoti said on the recommendations, which will now be examined by DoT. If found satisfactory, they will be taken to the cabinet and when approved, allow companies to get satcom licenses to start services.To ensure that companies don't squat on the spectrum and delay launch, Trai also fixed a 'minimum charge' of Rs 3,500 per MHz for the companies.Lahoti said an additional annual charge of Rs 500 per subscriber has been fixed if satcom companies acquire customers in urban areas, where network coverage is already robust. This is to ensure that they concentrate more on providing rural connectivity.",Trai recommended a charge of 4% of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) for satellite communications operators.

Japan's SMBC to buy 20% in Yes Bank,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/japans-smbc-to-buy-20-in-yes-bank/articleshow/121041472.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

MUMBAI: Five years after a group of Indian lenders led by SBI stepped in to rescue Yes Bank, Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) will acquire a 20% stake in the private lender for Rs 13,483 crore, making it the largest shareholder. The deal, India's biggest cross-border banking investment, marks a shift in ownership of the bank once run by veteran banker Rana Kapoor.Kapoor lost control in 2020 after the bank nearly collapsed due to bad loans, which wiped out its net worth. RBI then mandated a reconstruction scheme under which eight Indian banks took equity stakes.SBI will now sell a 13.2% stake, cutting its holding to just over 10%. ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, IDFC First Bank, Federal Bank, and Bandhan Bank will offload a combined 6.8%.The deal is priced at Rs 21.5 per share, above the recent market price and more than double what the rescuing banks invested.SMBC, a unit of Japan's second-largest bank by assets, will become Yes Bank's anchor investor after securing regulatory and shareholder approvals. The deal may reshape the bank's strategy and comes amid SMBC's broader push into Asia. Its parent, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, has $2 trillion in assets and recently took full ownership of its Indian NBFC arm, SMFG India Credit (formerly Fullerton).SMFG sees India as a counterweight to Japan's ageing population and low growth. The firm is betting on India's demographics and macroeconomic momentum.On May 6, after reports of SMBC's interest, Yes Bank denied knowledge of any unannounced developments, causing shares to erase a 10% gain. The stock again surged 10% on Friday ahead of the announcement.Banking industry observers are waiting to see if SMBC takes the wholly-owned subsidiary (WoS) route in Yes Bank. In the past, both DBS and State Bank of Mauritius used the WoS route to acquire a local banking licence. Most large foreign banks operate as branches and need permission to open new ones. SMBC will also have to deal with a bank that has a bloated equity base, following massive capital infusions.","Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) will acquire a 20% stake in the private lender for Rs 13,483 crore.

India registered a formal protest, citing Pakistan’s poor track record with IMF reforms and expressing fears of fund diversion. New Delhi abstained from the vote.“Rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism sends a dangerous message,” the finance ministry said in a statement.“It exposes funding agencies and donors to reputational risks and undermines global values.”Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the development, describing it as a “defeat of India’s high-handed tactics” and a sign of international confidence in Pakistan’s economic recovery. “Indian attempts to sabotage the IMF programme have failed,” the Pak's PMO said, accusing India of plotting “a conspiracy to divert attention” through “unilateral aggression.”The new disbursement brings total IMF funding to Pakistan under the EFF to around $2 billion. The full $7 billion package, agreed in July last year, is structured over 39 months in seven instalments, contingent on successful reforms including tax restructuring, energy sector reforms, and pricing adjustments in utilities and industries.The IMF and Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement in March on the first biannual review, which included commitments such as the introduction of a carbon levy and tariff revisions.","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday approved the immediate disbursement of $1 billion to Pakistan.

US stocks are drifting Friday as Wall Street heads toward the end of an unusually quiet week.The S&P 500 was up 0.4 percent in morning trading and on track to erase what had been a small loss for the week. This may be the first week in seven where the index at the heart of many 401(k) accounts moves by less than 1.5 per cent, after swinging sharply first on fears about President Donald Trump's trade war and then on hopes that he'll relent on some of his tariffs.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 86 points, or 0.2 per cent, as of 10 am Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6 per cent higher.The big event for the week is likely coming on Saturday, when trading will be closed in financial markets. That's when high-level US and Chinese officials will be meeting in Switzerland for their first talks since Trump launched an escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies.The fear among investors and economists is that a recession could hit if the United States doesn't reach trade deals that lower tariffs by enough and quickly enough.Trump on Friday floated the idea of bringing tariffs on Chinese imports down to 80 per cent from their current 145 per cent rate, but he said it'll be up to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who will be in Switzerland. While that would indeed be a reduction, it would still be high, and Trump's posting on social media caused a brief jolt in financial markets.Futures for US stocks sank immediately.But markets later calmed as the wait continued for what US and Chinese officials will say after their meeting.Trump also talked up the potential for more trade deals that could be on the way, following his announcement the day before on an agreement with the United Kingdom.""Many Trade Deals in the hopper, all good (GREAT!) ones!"" he said on his Truth Social network.In the meantime, the flow of earnings reports for the start of the year from companies is slowing but still moving the market.Lyft rallied 20.3 per cent after delivering a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though its revenue fell short. The company said it reached the highest weekly ridership levels in its history during the last week of March.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the chip giant known as TSMC, offered an encouraging report after saying its revenue in April leaped 48.1 per cent from a year earlier. That sent its stock that trades in the United States up 1.8 per cent.Insulet jumped 15.8 per cent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after the medical device company reported stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which sells tubeless insulin pump technology, also raised its forecast for an underlying revenue trend for the full year.They helped offset a 7.5 per cent drop for Expedia. The travel website, which owns Vrbo and Hotels.com, reported a stronger profit than analysts expected, but it also said demand was weaker than it expected during the quarter. It highlighted softer-than-expected demand in the United States, as well as a nearly 30 per cent decline in bookings from Canada to its southern neighbor.Other travel-related companies, including Hilton and Airbnb, have reported a similar softening in travel demand to the US in their recent earnings reports.In stock markets abroad, indexes were higher in Europe after finishing mixed in Asia.Stocks rose 0.4 per cent in Hong Kong but fell 0.3 per cent in Shanghai after China reported that its exports rose at a faster-than-expected 8.1 per cent annual pace in April. Exports to the United States dropped more than 20 per cent, however, as Trump's steep tariff increases took effect. China is the world's biggest exporter.In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.36 per cent from 4.37 per cent late Thursday.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 86 points, or 0.2 per cent, as of 10 am Eastern time.

The deal was revealed by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick during the signing of a bilateral trade agreement between the US and the UK.The aircraft deal is expected to be led by International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, and Aer Lingus. As per industry sources IAG plans to order around 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and a similar number of long-haul jets from Airbus, including the A350 and A330neo, in a carefully balanced fleet expansion.“It’s a split order,” a source told Reuters.Though the announcement was made by the US government, Lutnick held back from revealing more details, saying he would let the airlines make the announcement themselves.More details are expected when IAG releases its quarterly earnings report on Friday.This new order will add to Boeing’s existing backlog, which already includes 149 aircraft ordered by UK-based buyers, 109 from airlines and 40 from a leasing company, valued at over $12 billion before discounts.Bloomberg News reported that apart from the 30 planes, IAG could also negotiate options for further purchases.Boeing is currently working to boost production of its best-selling 737 MAX to 38 jets per month, following a turbulent year that saw quality issues and a change in leadership.This high-stakes order also comes at a time of heightened trade tensions between the US and the EU, as the union had previously threatened to impose tariffs on Boeing planes if broader negotiations with Washington failed.","The deal is expected to be led by International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, and Aer Lingus.

Analysts suggest this unexpected rise reflects Beijing's strategy to redirect trade towards Southeast Asian nations to counter US tariffs reaching 145 percent imposed by President Donald Trump.Commercial activity between these leading economies has declined following Trump's implementation of tariffs, some reaching 245 percent, whilst China countered with 125 percent duties and additional measures.The April year-on-year export growth of 8.1 percent significantly exceeded Bloomberg analysts' predictions of 2.0 percent.Chinese customs data revealed substantial increases in exports to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, indicating a significant shift in trade patterns.""The global supply chain is being rerouted in real time,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management wrote in a note.""Vietnam looks set to become China's offshore escape hatch for US-facing goods,"" he said.""The manufacturing juggernaut is diverting flow wherever the tariff pain isn't.""US-bound exports decreased by 17.6 percent month-on-month.Financial markets have fluctuated since the White House initiated its tariff strategy, aimed at revitalising US manufacturing.

Gates told the New York Times that Musk's severe cuts to the US Agency for International Development were linked to a missed social engagement, appearing to criticise Musk's conduct.""People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them,"" Gates wrote, sharing a chart predicting his net worth will drop by 99% over the next two decades, reflecting a doubling of his philanthropic pace.Citing inspiration from 19th-century philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, Gates clarified he does not want to create a foundation that lasts forever. Gates expressed preference for swift distribution of billions rather than establishing a permanent foundation, citing emerging technologies' potential.Whilst acknowledging private foundations' impact, Gates stressed governmental roles' importance, lamenting significant budget reductions by various wealthy nations.""It's unclear whether the world's richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people. But the one thing we can guarantee is that, in all of our work, the Gates Foundation will support efforts to help people and countries pull themselves out of poverty,"" he wrote.These changes included Musk's ""Department of Government Efficiency"" severely cutting USAID during Trump's presidency.Gates described these reductions as ""stunning"" and more extensive than anticipated. Musk is ""the one who cut the USAID budget,"" Gates told the New York Times. ""He put it in the wood chipper,"" he added.In an interview with the Financial Times, Bill Gates mocked Elon Musk for confusing Gaza Province in Mozambique with Gaza in the Middle East while justifying aid cuts under the Trump administration.Criticising Musk’s role in slashing global health funding, Gates said, ""The picture of the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children is not a pretty one.""Gates, 69, is currently ranked 13th on Forbes’ real-time billionaire list with a net worth of $112.6 billion.

The reading came in below economists’ expectations of 230,000, based on a Reuters poll, and reversed some of the prior week’s spike attributed to school spring breaks in New York state.While the weekly drop reflects a still-sturdy job market, economists are increasingly wary of a potential slowdown ahead.President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff hikes—including a 145% duty on Chinese imports—have rattled both business and consumer sentiment, adding pressure to an economy already navigating inflation concerns and slower hiring momentum.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, speaking after the central bank kept interest rates steady at 4.25–4.50% on Wednesday, warned that the scale of tariff increases has been ""significantly larger than anticipated.""He added, “If sustained, they’re likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth and an increase in unemployment.”Despite those concerns, employers appear hesitant to shed workers. Many firms, having struggled to hire during and after the pandemic, remain reluctant to let go of existing employees. However, businesses directly exposed to trade risks have begun modest layoffs, hinting at deeper challenges.A recent ISM manufacturing survey highlighted that employment in the sector remained weak in April, with layoffs noted as the primary adjustment tool—an indication that job cuts are becoming more deliberate.The number of people receiving benefits after their initial claim—a proxy for ongoing hiring—fell by 29,000 to 1.879 million in the week ending April 26. However, other labour indicators flashed concern: while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2% in April, the median duration of unemployment rose to 10.4 weeks, up from 9.8 weeks in March.The economy added 177,000 jobs in April, showing moderate job creation but suggesting that hiring momentum may be slowing as businesses grow more cautious amid global trade tensions and monetary policy uncertainty.","Initial jobless claims dropped by 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 228,000 for the week ending May 3.

"What Warren Buffett, world’s 5th richest person, has to say about choosing the right life partner to succeed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/what-warren-buffett-worlds-5th-richest-person-has-to-say-about-choosing-the-right-life-partner-to-succeed/articleshow/121001274.cms,"Warren Buffett

Famous investor and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett announced that he will step down as CEO by the end of this year, with Vice Chairman Greg Abel set to succeed him. Buffett, 94, made the announcement during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting, adding that he will not sell a single share of Berkshire stock.Buffett's decision comes amid a lifetime of leadership at Berkshire Hathaway, where he transformed a struggling textile mill into one of the world’s most valuable conglomerates. He is widely regarded not only for his investment acumen but also for his personal integrity and long-term thinking.In reflecting on his journey, Buffett has often credited his late wife, Susan Buffett , as the most important influence in his life and success, according to an ET report.“What happened with me would not have happened without her,” Buffett said in HBO’s 2017 documentary Becoming Warren Buffett. The couple married in 1952 and had three children—Susie, Howard, and Peter—before Susan’s death in 2004 from a cerebral haemorrhage.Buffett has repeatedly emphasized the importance of choosing the right life partner. “Marry the right person. I’m serious about that,” he said during a 2009 Berkshire annual meeting.“It will make more difference in your life. It will change your aspirations, all kinds of things.”In a 2017 conversation with Bill Gates, Buffett echoed that sentiment: “You want to associate with people who are the kind of person you’d like to be. You’ll move in that direction. And the most important person by far in that respect is your spouse.”Buffett’s unique personal life has drawn attention over the years. Despite being married to Susan until her death, he fell in love with Astrid Menks, whom Susan had befriended and later introduced to Warren. Despite their physical separation, with Susan residing on the West Coast, they maintained their marriage and remained deeply connected to one another. After Susan moved to San Francisco, she asked Astrid, then working at a local restaurant, to help look after Warren. Astrid later became Buffett’s long-time companion and second wife.“She is a very helping, giving person,” Susan told Charlie Rose in a 2004 interview, explaining how Astrid came to care for Buffett. “She’s really a good soul.”Buffett's legacy as one of the most influential investors in history is tightly interwoven with both his professional brilliance and deeply personal relationships—especially with Susan, whom he often described as the second of only two major turning points in his life. The first, he says, was being born.As Buffett prepares to hand over the reins of Berkshire Hathaway to Greg Abel, his advice to future generations remains grounded in humility: choose the right people, both in life and business.","Buffett, 94, made the announcement during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

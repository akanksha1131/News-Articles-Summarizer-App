Gold price prediction today

:

Where are gold prices headed? What’s the outlook for silver prices? Gold prices may trade with a bearish bias, and the silver market is very tight, according to Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan:

Gold Performance:

Gold, Silver Under Pressure After Peaks: Should You Invest And Hold Precious Metals Or Sell Off?

Spot gold, although stuck in the $4700-$5100 range, continues to exhibit huge volatility on conflicting signals and indicators. In the week ending February 13, spot gold traded between $4878 (February 12) and $5120 (February 11). The yellow metal plunged over $200 on Feb. 12 as Bloomberg broke a story of a Russian memo by the Kremlin that outlined Russia's return to the US Dollar along with possible strategic deals with the US in several key areas like natural gas, offshore petroleum, critical minerals, etc. However, gold quickly recovered as Russia and the US refrained from officially commenting on the document.

Spot gold closed with a weekly gain of 1.54% at $5042 in the week ending February 13; it was its highest weekly close ever.

Liquidity was thin on February 16 as the US observed the Presidents’ Day Holiday on February 16 and China began its Lunar Holidays that will last until February 23.

At the time of writing this article, the yellow metal was changing hands at $4992, down nearly 1% for the day, as investors turn cautious before the second-round of US-Iran talks scheduled to begin in Geneva on February 17. MCX April gold at Rs 154,800 was down 0.70% for the day.

Geopolitics watch:

The US and Iran are set to resume indirect talks on Tuesday in Geneva. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu proposed terms including that Iran shouldn’t possess enriched material or nuclear enrichment capabilities. He also suggested limiting the range of Iranian ballistic missiles, citing an MTCR limitation of 300 KMs that Iran is supposed to adhere to.

The US is ramping up its military buildup near Iran as it keeps its options open. Pictures from Earth-Observation confirm that the nuclear-powered US aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln is now in the Arabian Sea off Oman. USS Gerald R. Ford, one of the largest warships, is also being redirected from the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on Monday began a series of military exercises in the Strait of Hormuz-- the strategic waterway through which about 20 percent of the world's oil production passes.

US-led talks to end the war in Ukraine are also scheduled to start in Geneva on Tuesday, though talks are likely to be sticky.

Authorities in China's gold hub warn against illegal gold trading:

On Friday, authorities in Shenzhen, China issued a warning against ""illegal gold trading activities"", including apps offering leverage to retail investors and online live streams promoting bullion sales.

The authorities also warned against using phrases like ""gold prices will soar"" or ""make big money by buying gold"", and adulterating materials that resemble pure gold or other precious materials.

ETFs and COMEX inventory:

As of February 13, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 100.13 MOz, up around 1.18 MOz YTD; holdings are hovering around the highest level since August 2022.

Registered COMEX gold inventory slid to 17.57 MOz on February 13-- lowest since February 13, 2025, and is down over 27% since the record peak of 24.25 MOz seen in April last year.

Data roundup:

Japan's annualized 4Q QoQ GDP, released on Monday, came in at 0.2% Vs the estimate of 1.6%. The UK's 4Q QoQ GDP at 0.1% trailed the estimate of 0.2%.

US data released last week were somewhat mixed. The Nonfarm payroll report released in February was largely reassuring as the US employers added 130K jobs in January (forecast 65K), while the unemployment rate edged lower from 4.4% to 4.3% Vs the estimate of 4.4%. Two-month prior data was revised lower by 17K though. Average hourly earnings rose 3.7% y-o-y that matched the estimate. Average weekly hours all employees came in 34.3 Vs the forecast of 34.2 as labour force participation improved from 62.4% to 62.5%. The job report showed the biggest drop in part-time jobs since June 2022; more people quit their jobs as they became more confident about job prospects. However, investors are taking nonfarm payroll reports with a pinch of salt as the final benchmark payrolls revisions slashed 862 K jobs (forecast -825K) in 2025. It means that the US employers added merely 181K jobs in 2025, which is the worst job growth since 2003 outside of the global financial crisis and Covid periods.

US Retail sales stagnated (forecast 0.4%) in December after rising 0.6% in November. Retail sales control group contracted by 0.1% Vs the forecast of a 0.4% increase.

Much-awaited US CPI data (January) were mostly subdued as headline CPI rose 0.2% m-o-m (forecast 0.3%, Prior 0.3%) and was up by 2.4% y-o-y (estimate 2.5%, prior 2.7%). Core CPI rose 0.3% m-o-m (estimate 0.3%, prior 0.2%) and increased by 2.5% y-o-y, in line with the estimate and slightly cooler than the prior reading of 2.6%. However, no rate cut is expected in March.

Dollar Index and yields:

Despite a somewhat encouraging January job report, the US Dollar Index posted a weekly loss of 0.75% in the week ending February 13 as it closed at 96.91. Coller-than-expected CPI data weighed on the Greenback. At the time of writing this article, the Index was trading at 97.05, up by around 0.15% for the day.

Last week, driven by rate cut optimism going forward as US CPI data was mostly subdued, the two-year US yields fell by nine bps to 3.40%, the lowest since October 17; ten-year yields at 4.04% are the lowest level since December 3.

CFTC positioning:

As per the CFTC data, in the week ending February 10, money managers have decreased their bullish gold bets by 400 net-longs to 93,038; the net-long position was the least bullish in 16 weeks.

Long-only positions fell 1,053 lots to 116,157, the lowest in more than 23 months.

Major Upcoming data and event:

Major US data/reports in focus include January 28 FOMC minutes (Feb. 19), S&P PMIs (Feb. 20), real personal spending (Feb. 20), PCE Price Index (Feb. 20) and University of Michigan consumer sentiment (Feb. 20).

The Eurozone's and the UK's PMIs to be released on Feb. 20 will also be in focus. UK's Dec. job report and January's CPI report to be released respectively on Feb. 17 and 18 will also garner investors' attention.

Japan's national CPI data (Jan.) will be released on Feb. 20.

Gold Price Outlook:

In the very short-term, geopolitical developments will be the primary driver of gold prices.

Considering the January US nonfarm payroll report and easing geopolitical worries, gold is looking somewhat extended at current levels, though concerns over the tech sector continue to limit the downside.

The US Dollar Index is struggling to gather upward momentum despite encouraging job and ISM reports as the US yields fall.

A deal with Iran may not be without certain roadblocks and binding terms, which may keep gold supported at lower levels.

Overall, gold is expected to range trade with a slight bearish tilt unless geopolitical tensions escalate further.

The yellow metal may test the support around $4900 (MCX Gold April 152,000); a successful breach of this support will bring $4850 (Rs 150,300)/$4740 (Rs 147,000) into focus. Resistance is at $5050 (Rs 156.500)/$5125 (Rs 159,000).

Silver Price Outlook:

The silver market in China remains exceptionally tight as the near-to-second month spread is at a backwardation of 354 Yuan/Kg. However, silver is under pressure on possibility of easing geopolitical tensions and a firmer US Dollar.

The white metal may trade between $70 (Rs 218,000) and $84 (Rs 262,000) in the near-term. A decisive breach of $70 support will embolden bears to test the $64 (Rs 2000,000) support.

India’s exports to US drop 22% due to Trump’s 50% tariffs; overall trade data suggests signs of resilient market diversification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-exports-to-us-drop-22-due-to-trumps-50-tariffs-overall-trade-data-suggests-signs-of-resilient-market-diversification/articleshow/128429703.cms,"India’s exports to the US also fell by 21.77% to $6.6 billion in January, largely due to the 50% tariffs imposed by the Donald Trump administration.

Trump tariffs hit India’s exports to US

India’s Diversifying Exports Basket

India’s merchandise exports grew marginally in January to $36.56 billion, up 0.61%. On the other hand, imports rose sharply by 19.2% to $71.24 billion, compared to $59.77 billion in the same period last year. As a result, the country’s trade deficit widened to $34.68 billion in January.Exports continued to remain on an upward trajectory in both goods and services segments. According to Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal, the total exports of goods and services are expected to cross $860 billion during the current financial year.For the April to January period, exports increased by 2.22% to $366.63 billion.India’s exports to the US also fell by 21.77% to $6.6 billion in January, largely due to the 50% tariffs imposed by the Donald Trump administration.The US imposed a broad 50% tariff on Indian goods entering its market from August 27. The two countries have since concluded an interim trade arrangement under which the US removed 25% penal tariffs on Indian products from February 7, while reciprocal tariffs are set to be reduced to 18% from 25%. India’s exports are now competitively placed among regional peers.Exports had also contracted in September, October and December last year, although shipments had seen a growth of 22.61% in November.Imports from the United States, meanwhile, increased by 23.71% to $4.5 billion in January, the data showed.During the April to January period of the current financial year, India’s exports to the US rose by 5.85% to $72.46 billion, while imports grew by 13.87% to $43.92 billion.Exports to China surged by 55.65% to $1.63 billion during January, while imports from China rose 16.67% to $12.23 billion. For the April-January period of the fiscal year, exports to China increased by 38.37% to $15.88 billion, whereas imports expanded by 13.82% to $108.18 billion.India’s exports to countries including the UAE, Netherlands, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Italy, Hong Kong, Spain, Belgium, Malaysia and Vietnam recorded positive growth during the month under review. In contrast, shipments to the UK, Bangladesh, Singapore, Australia, France and Brazil declined.On the import side, inflows fell from countries such as Russia, Iraq, Korea, Germany, Thailand and Australia, while imports increased from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia. India primarily imports gold from Switzerland, and purchases from the country jumped sharply by 836.85% in January to $3.95 billion.According to the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), the latest trade figures for January 2026 reflect the significant impact of US tariffs on India’s export performance, while also indicating early signs of diversification into other markets.“Shipments to the United States followed a clear three-phase pattern between April 2025 and January 2026. After a brief uptick in May, exports fell steadily from $8.3 billion in June to $5.5 billion in September as tariff pressures intensified. A short-lived recovery followed, with exports rising to $6.3 billion in October and $7.0 billion in November, but the rebound faded when hopes of a quick trade deal did not materialise. Exports slipped again to $6.9 billion in December and $6.6 billion in January. With Washington expected to cut reciprocal tariffs on most Indian goods from 50% to 18% this week, we anticipate a swift recovery in shipments,” said GTRI in a note.The broader data suggest that the slowdown is largely concentrated in shipments to the US rather than reflecting a global decline.“Exports to the rest of the world remained resilient, edging up from $29.9 billion to $30.0 billion (+0.3%). The figures suggest that tariff barriers in the US market have driven India’s recent export slowdown, even as exporters begin cautiously expanding beyond their largest single market,” GTRI added.","India’s merchandise exports grew marginally in January to $36.56 billion, up 0.61%.

Stock market today: Indian equity benchmarks opened flat in trade on Wednesday. While the 50-share index Nifty was near 25,700, the 30-share BSE Sensex was down marginally. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,716.35, down 9 points or 0.035%. BSE Sensex was at 83,438.94, down 12 points or 0.014%.Experts believe that the stock market is likely to remain steady with a positive undertone in the near term, supported by global trends.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The better-than-expected Q3 results and indications of continuing momentum in earnings growth, going forward, are positive factors that will keep the market resilient. The volatility in IT stocks may continue, in response to incoming news relating to the sector. Overall, IT stocks may remain weak since uncertainty surrounding the sector is huge and large institutional investors are unlikely to invest big time in IT stocks, unless valuations become compelling. There can be churns away from IT towards other sectors like banking and financials, automobiles, telecom, pharmaceuticals etc where there is good earnings visibility.”“This is the time to gradually increase exposure to equity.But many retail investors are increasing investments in gold and silver ETFs, which is a risky game in the present context. Early signs of a shift in the investment strategy of FIIs are visible now. In the cash market, FIIs have been buyers in eight out of the last thirteen trading days. This trend and improving prospects for corporate earnings bode well for the market. ""US equities ended marginally higher after a weak start to the session, helped by a rebound in technology stocks and support from financial shares. The recovery followed earlier volatility as investors assessed the outlook for artificial intelligence after recent turbulence that had pulled major indices away from record levels.Asian markets also posted modest gains in thin holiday trading. Investor sentiment remained cautious as markets continued to digest recent swings in global equities linked to concerns around AI-driven disruptions.","The 50-share index Nifty was near 25,700, the 30-share BSE Sensex was down marginally.

"US, Japan seal ‘massive’ trade deal; Tokyo to invest $550 billion in America; key details of the pact",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-japan-seal-massive-trade-deal-tokyo-to-invest-550-billion-in-america-key-details-of-the-pact/articleshow/128488072.cms,"US President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a “MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan,” under which Tokyo will make a ""$550 BILLION commitment to invest in the United States of America. "" The White House unveiled three large-scale investment projects backed by Tokyo with a combined value of $36 billion, representing the first tranche under Japan’s $550 billion commitment to invest in the United States as part of the newly agreed trade arrangement. Under the trade deal, the US will slash tariffs on Japanese imports to 15%.The initiatives cover energy exports, power generation and advanced manufacturing, spread across Texas, Ohio and Georgia.Announcing the development on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said, ""Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched! Japan is now officially, and financially, moving forward with the FIRST set of Investments under its $550 BILLION Dollar Commitment to invest in the United States of America — part of our Historic Trade Deal to REVITALIZE the American Industrial Base, create HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of GREAT American Jobs, and strengthen our National and Economic Security like never before..""He added that the projects would focus on “Oil & Gas in the Great State of Texas, Power Generation in the Great State of Ohio, and Critical Minerals in the Great State of Georgia.”The announcement also includes a $33 billion natural gas-fired power plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said that the facility would generate 9.2 gigawatts of electricity annually, describing it as the largest natural gas-fired generating facility in US history. According to him, the output would be more than enough to power all homes in Ohio.The plant will be operated by SB Energy, a subsidiary of Japanese technology investor SoftBank Group. The additional capacity is expected to strengthen baseload supply at a time when electricity demand is rising quickly, driven by data centres supporting artificial intelligence applications, Reuters reported.Referring to the Ohio facility in his post, Trump wrote, ""The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS. The Gas Power Plant in Ohio (A State I won THREE TIMES!) will be the largest in History, the LNG Facility in the Gulf of America will drive Exports, and further our Country's Energy DOMINANCE, and our Critical Minerals Facility will end our FOOLISH dependance on Foreign Sources. ""A second major project involves Japan’s investment in the $2.1 billion Texas GulfLink deepwater crude oil export terminal off the Texas coast. The White House said the funding would support the development of the offshore facility.Lutnick, as cited by Reuters, stated, ""This project is expected to generate $20–30 billion annually in U.S. crude exports, secure export capacity for our refineries, and reinforce America’s position as the world’s leading energy supplier.""Texas GulfLink, being developed by Sentinel Midstream, confirmed its participation in the initiative and said it was ""honored to be a trusted partner with the US department of commerce and the government of Japan.""The third project will see the establishment of a synthetic industrial diamond manufacturing plant in Georgia, valued at around $600 million. Lutnick said the high-pressure facility would meet 100 per cent of US demand for synthetic diamond grit, a material used in advanced manufacturing and semiconductor production. The United States currently relies largely on China for such supplies.The White House said the plant would be operated by Element Six, an industrial diamond company and a unit of De Beers Group, the world’s largest diamond producer.It remains unclear how much of the total project costs will be financed directly by Japanese entities and under what specific conditions. Under an earlier US-Japan agreement, profits from such ventures were to be shared equally until Japan’s initial investment was recovered, after which the split would shift to 90-10 in favour of the United States.The announcements followed meetings last week between Lutnick and Japan’s economic and trade minister, Ryosei Akazawa. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Akazawa said that several issues were still unresolved before deals could be formally announced.","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a “MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan,” under which Tokyo will make a ""$550 BILLION commitment to invest in the United States of America"" The initiatives cover energy exports, power generation and advanced manufacturing, spread across Texas, Ohio and Georgia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128489369,imgsize-1167561,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-generated-image-used-only-for-representational-purpose.jpg"

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Bharti Airtel is taking strong support near the middle band of the Bollinger Bands, indicating that price is holding around its short-term mean and attracting buying interest at lower levels. Momentum indicators are gradually turning constructive, with RSI taking support at its 14-period DEMA, suggesting strengthening internal momentum. Additionally, the MACD histogram is beginning to expand on the upside, hinting at a potential shift toward bullish momentum. The overall setup points toward improving strength as long as the stock sustains above the middle band support zone.Finpipe has decisively breached the Monthly Pivot R1 resistance, signalling renewed strength in the ongoing trend. The breakout above the Ichimoku Cloud confirms a shift toward bullish momentum and reflects improving price structure. The Alligator indicator shows its three lines aligned and running parallel, indicating the emergence of a sustained trending move. A sharp rise in volumes validates strong participation at higher levels, adding conviction to the breakout. Meanwhile, the DMI remains positive, and the MACD has delivered a bullish crossover, reinforcing the constructive outlook.Coal India is undergoing a corrective phase after a sharp rally of nearly 90 points from the 370 lows.

MUMBAI: Even as property prices continued to rise at a faster pace - 2.2 % in the Dec quarter, rental demand declined by 2.4% quarter-on-quarter across India, indicating a market adjusting to yield compression rather than a broad-based slowdown, Magicbricks said in a report. Chennai emerged as the top market in terms of gross rental yields at 4.16%, followed by Ahmedabad at 3.98% and Hyderabad at 3.93%. Bengaluru and Kolkata reported similar yield levels at 3.88% each.

InCred has downgraded Hindalco to reduce from add with the target price cut to Rs 631 from Rs 785. Analysts said peak aluminium prices do not bode well for Indian operations. Higher capex will lead to leveraging of the balance sheet. They also expect Hindalco’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) expected to decline to Rs 26,000 crore in FY28 from Rs 36,600 crore in FY26.Macquarie has an outperform rating on L&T with the target price at Rs 4,620. Analysts said L&T is divesting its Nabha Power Plant, which is part of its long-term strategy to exit non-core and asset-heavy businesses. They don't expect the sale to have a material impact on target price since this transaction, along with the planned sale of Hyderabad Metro, is expected to help improve the balance sheet and capital allocation. Company is incrementally looking at investing in new-age businesses.JP Morgan has a neutral rating on Torrent Power with the target price at Rs 1,525. Analysts said the company announced acquisition of Nabha Power from L&T for Rs 6,900 crore. The plant has 13 years of residual power purchase agreement, land and basic infra available for 800MW additional capacity and possibility of renewing PPA for 10-15 years more at mutually agreed terms given solid technical health of its equipment.Analysts view the acquisition as financially incrementally positive for Torrent Power given reasonable valuations and possibility of upside over longer term due to capacity expansion and additional PPA post expiry of the current one.Citigroup has downgraded Ola Electric to sell from buy with the target price halved to Rs 27 from Rs 55. Analysts said persistent headwinds to volume growth exist and EV penetration in the Indian 2W sector has been more sluggish than expected. They also feel GST cuts have further slowed electrification. Ola has lost market share, hampered by service issues, high competition, and adverse customer perception. They also said its Q3 results were below estimates due to negative operating leverage. They, however, acknowledged impressive gross margin trends, and said better operating leverage could boost EBITDA. Management’s efforts to improve product/service quality could take some time to fructify, they said.Nuvama maintained its buy rating on Ahluwalia Contracts with the revised target price of Rs 1,147 from Rs 1,154 earlier. Analysts said the company’s revenue and margins improved on an annual basis on the back of steady ramp-up in execution on key projects. Its order book remained robust, they said. Elongated construction ban in the NCR region due to pollution issues has now virtually become a recurring factor every year.","InCred has downgraded Hindalco to reduce from add with the target price cut to Rs 631 from Rs 785.

NEW DELHI: India needs to think beyond incremental gains and build globally competitive deep tech companies, investors said at the AI Impact Summit on Tuesday, arguing frugality and scale could position the country as a long-term innovation hub.""The chaos that's inherited in India and the frugality that's there breeds innovation. The moment you have a large amount of surplus, you never look at optimisation. The greatest deep tech innovations across the world have always happened from a place of frugality,"" said Siddarth Pai, co-founder of 3one4 Capital.Pai said India's structural constraints must not be viewed as disadvantages but as conditions that force sharper engineering and capital efficiency.Kris Gopalakrishnan, co-founder of Axilor Ventures and Infosys, urged founders to target global markets from the start. ""What's required is to think big. We have examples of technology from India going global. Our MOSIP open-source identity programme is running in 29 countries; 300 million people got IDs with that...,"" he said.Gopalakrishnan said while foundational technologies such as AI, robotics and quantum computing require patient capital and policy innovation, the larger opportunity lies in applying these technologies across sectors such as agriculture, healthcare and education.A report released at the event underscored the growing investor focus on AI and deep tech. AI companies attracted 188 investments worth $1.2 billion in 2025, marking a 58% year-on-year increase. AI now accounts for 12% of total venture capital funding, up from under 5% in 2020. Since 2016, nearly $28 billion has been invested across more than 2,100 deep tech deals in India, with the segment now representing 15% of overall private equity and venture capital activity.The report noted that while early-stage capital has strengthened, growth-stage funding remains limited, and the absence of large specialist deep tech funds could constrain global scaling.","India needs to think beyond incremental gains and build globally competitive deep tech companies, investors say.

NEW DELHI: Vinod Khosla, founder of Sun Microsystems and Khosla Ventures, on Tuesday warned that India's IT services industry will cease to exist in its current form by 2030 as AI reshapes global services, while predicting that artificial general intelligence could arrive within two years.""It's clear that people in India don't believe that the whole idea of IT services will go away. By 2030, there will be no such thing as IT services. There will be no such thing as BPO. Those are gone,"" Khosla said at the AI Impact Summit.He argued that new AI-native services would replace traditional outsourcing models. ""There will be new kinds of services based on AI that Indian companies can form and bring to the rest of the world because India has the best engineers, talent, and education. So, there are opportunities, but those will be very, very disruptive to the Indian economy.""Khosla also made a case for AI-led transformation in healthcare. Recalling his early thinking on the subject, he said he had concluded as far back as 2008 that scaling human doctors alone would not solve access gaps. ""If I personally had a trillion dollars and 30 years, I could not get the doctor-patient ratio the same in India as it is in the US,"" he said.""That's why in 2008, I decided the only solution was an AI doctor.""He estimated that delivering daily primary care to 700 million Indians could cost ""less than a billion dollars or $2 billion a year"", calling it a small fraction of national health expenditure.More broadly, Khosla added the adoption of AI would be shaped less by technological capability and more by politics. ""The biggest issue to be managed very, very carefully is politics. Politics, not technical capability, will be the key determinant of what is adopted and what's not adopted.""Looking further ahead, he suggested work itself may become optional. ""By 2050, it will be very clear that nobody needs jobs because enough production of goods and services will be near free,"" he said, arguing people would pursue passions rather than employment.","Vinod Khosla: By 2030, there will be no such thing as IT services.

NEW DELHI: Despite the surge in gold and silver imports upsetting the trade balance, the trends for the two precious metals are very different.With the average price of gold rising nearly 25% on a year-on-year basis to $94,554 a kg during April-Dec, buyers became cautious, resulting in demand falling. Data released by the commerce department slowed gold import volume dipped 18.3% to 522 tonnes during the nine-month period.

As a result, silver imports more than doubled in April-Dec to $7.8 billion against $3.4 billion in nine-month period in 2024. A part of the reason is industrial use for silver, whereas gold is seen more as an investment instrument.","Average price of gold rose nearly 25% on a year-on-year basis to $94,554 a kg during April-Dec.

MUMBAI: Increased opportunities to hedge foreign exchange risk and longer trading hours are at the heart of a proposed overhaul by RBI to liberalise access to currency markets.The draft framework broadens the different types of derivatives that banks (authorised dealers) may offer to individuals and firms, extending hedging tools for currency and interest-rate exposures. Trades could be executed across over-the-counter markets, domestic exchanges, platforms in international financial centres and approved offshore electronic venues, drawing Indian participants more firmly into global liquidity pools.The reforms also relax timings keeping in mind the 24-hour nature of forex markets. Banks would be free to transact with clients and counterparties beyond domestic market hours, allowing exposures to be managed across time zones and prices to adjust more continuously. Greater latitude to deal with overseas branches, subsidiaries and offshore banking units will enable further integration of onshore and offshore markets. The rules permit non-deliverable derivatives linked to the rupee with offshore counterparties under safeguards, and allow banks involved in gold-related activities to hedge price risk abroad.The central bank also proposes to put idle foreign-currency balances to work.With board approval, banks can place surplus funds overnight, lend them short term against foreign government securities, or invest in short-dated overseas government paper and money-market instruments. They may also extend loans in rupees or foreign currency at home or abroad.Unused FCNR(B) deposits can be invested in longer-dated foreign sovereign bonds, provided maturities do not outlast the underlying deposits. Dealers said that the revised norms will help deepen foreign exchange markets and bring them in line with developed economies.","The draft framework broadens the different types of derivatives that banks (authorised dealers) may offer to individuals and firms.

BENGALURU: Calling the AI shift a ""root-and-branch surgery"" of how businesses function, Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani urged enterprises to rethink not just technology stacks but also how employees work, adapt, and create value in an AI-first world.Speaking at the Infosys Analyst Day held on Tuesday, Nilekani said the conversation around AI moved beyond experimentation to large-scale organisational change that directly affects the workforce.""And operating model - how do we make this at scale? How do you get a firm with hundreds of employees to change all the things and make it work?"" he said, describing the transition as both a technological and human challenge. For decades, enterprise technology operated within a predictable framework. ""Technology is always deterministic. You said A plus B equals C,"" Nilekani explained. AI, however, introduces a different paradigm. ""Every time you give a prompt, you'll probably get a different answer. How do you deal with this non-deterministic world while ensuring robustness and reliability?"" This unpredictability is pushing companies to reshape employee roles rather than simply automate tasks. Workers must collaborate with intelligent systems, validate outputs, and apply judgement, elevating skills such as critical thinking, prompt design, oversight, and ethical decision-making. Mental models built over decades must evolve as organisations design processes that combine human supervision with machine intelligence. He described the transition as ""a fundamental root-and-branch surgery of the way business is done,"" underscoring why this technology wave differs from earlier ones. A major barrier to this transformation, he noted, lies beneath many large enterprises: deeply entrenched legacy systems.","Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani urged enterprises to rethink how employees work, adapt, and create value in an AI-first world.

Peel-good story

BENGALURU: Unpacking suitcases, arranging wardrobes, handling time-consuming tasks such as peeling pomegranates and garlic, or prepping for weekend gatherings - these are among the chores urban households are increasingly getting done through domestic help apps, alongside routine chores such as dishes and laundry.What began as a convenience experiment is now scaling rapidly across parts of Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi NCR, driven by repeat usage and aggressive supply build-out. Bengaluru-based Snabbit has gone from roughly 100,000 monthly jobs in Aug 2025 to a run rate of 10 lakh monthly jobs currently, founder and chief executive Aayush Agarwal told TOI, a tenfold increase in under six months. ""We are a very reliable backup for all households. Whether it is absenteeism, ad hoc support or getting extra work done, Snabbit provides the comfort of having someone just a tap away,"" Agarwal said.A Bellandur resident said she uses the app about twice a month, mainly when her regular help is absent or when guests are visiting.Urban Company's InstaHelp, launched last year, shows a similar trajectory. The vertical reached 468,000 orders in Oct 2025 within eight months of launch, according to an earlier shareholder letter.By the Oct to Dec quarter, InstaHelp reported 1.6 million orders, implying average monthly volumes of over 500,000.""The micro markets where we are present, we are penetrating very fast. And the level of customer usage and retention that we are seeing is very encouraging,"" Urban Company founder and chief executive Abhiraj Singh Bhal said in the company's latest analyst conference. However, the company also disclosed that InstaHelp reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of Rs 44 crore in the quarter, driven by investments in supply onboarding, training and early earnings support. EBITDA is a financial metric used to evaluate a company's operating performance and profitability.On the supply side, the model departs from traditional gig structures. Snabbit's service professionals sign up for fixed shifts and earn between Rs 20,000 and Rs 25,000 per month depending on shift duration, Agarwal told TOI, adding that this pay is assured irrespective of the number of jobs assigned during the shift. Similar pay bands exist across rival platforms.Investors argue that durability will depend less on gross order growth and more on how often customers return.""Order growth is an outcome metric. Frequency and retention matter the most,"" Rahul Taneja, partner at Lightspeed, said. In certain high-frequency neighbourhoods, customers are already booking up to eight times a month, and in those segments, repeat usage is stronger than what early food delivery or quick commerce platforms saw in their formative months, he said.Consultants tracking the space point out that usage remains largely supplemental rather than substitutive. ""Currently, the service acts primarily as a supplementary layer, stepping in when regular domestic help is unavailable rather than replacing full-time help,"" said Artham Khetan, engagement manager at Redseer Strategy Consultants.","Bengaluru-based Snabbit has gone from roughly 100,000 monthly jobs in Aug 2025 to a run rate of 10 lakh monthly jobs currently.

MUMBAI: Real estate, infrastructure, and corporate sectors are set to gain wider access to overseas funding with RBI overhauling external commercial borrowing (ECB) rules, sharply expanding the pool of eligible borrowers and clarifying permissible uses under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 framework.The amended regulations shift the ECB regime from a restricted, sector-based eligibility model to a broad entity-based approach. Any non-individual resident entity incorporated under a central or state law can now raise overseas loans, subject to applicable statutory permissions. The wider eligibility is expected to ease funding constraints for statutory bodies, LLPs, development authorities and companies undergoing restructuring or insolvency resolution. While individuals are allowed to borrow from non-resident Indians or overseas citizens of India, the lenders have to convert money into rupees first and the money has to be repaid into their non-resident accounts.A key boost comes for construction and development activity, where ECB funding has now been explicitly permitted with operational safeguards. Overseas borrowings can be used for township development, residential and commercial construction, integrated projects and city-level infrastructure, as well as hotels, hospitals and educational institutions.However, developers must complete trunk infrastructure such as roads, water supply and drainage before selling plots, signalling a shift toward financing structured development rather than speculative real estate activity.Industrial infrastructure is also set to benefit. The framework formally enables ECB funding for industrial parks subject to defined conditions, including a minimum number of units, caps on space concentration and a mandated share of industrial activity. The move is expected to support manufacturing-linked infrastructure and industrial cluster development.Selective segments of the agriculture ecosystem have also been opened for overseas borrowing. Controlled-environment cultivation, seed production, animal husbandry, aquaculture and agro-related services are now expressly permitted uses, potentially expanding capital access for high-value and technology-driven agri activities.Separately, resident individuals can now borrow in rupees from non-resident Indians or OCI relatives on a non-repatriation basis, creating an additional cross-border borrowing channel outside the ECB framework.","Real estate, infrastructure, and corporate sectors set to gain wider access to overseas funding.

The investment is expected to ""catalyse"" an additional $150 billion investment across server manufacturing, advanced electrical infrastructure and related sectors, potentially fueling a $250 billion AI infrastructure ecosystem in India over the decade, flagship Adani Enterprises said in a statement on Tuesday.From Google to Amazon and Reliance Industries, deep-pocketed business giants from across the world have pledged several billion dollars of investments to set up data centres in India, fueled by rapid adoption of AI by enterprises, lower costs (of building data centres compared to other places) and data localisation norms mandated by the govt. The recent investment will build on AdaniConneX's existing 2GW national data centre which is expanding towards a 5GW target, helped by partnerships with tech majors Google and Microsoft, the company said.In Oct last year, Adani Enterprises through its joint venture company AdaniConneX announced a partnership with Google, which is spending $15 billion to build India's largest AI data centre hub and energy infrastructure in Visakhapatnam.With Microsoft, it is setting up campuses across Hyderabad and Pune, the statement indicated without sharing additional details.The Adani Group is also in discussions with other major players looking to build large-scale data centre campuses across India, it said, adding that the company will also partner with Walmart's Flipkart to develop a second AI data centre to support Flipkart's AI workloads and next-generation digital commerce.The announcement coincides with the inaugural AI Impact summit being hosted by New Delhi where top global tech leaders including Google's Sundar Pichai, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei will be in attendance. ""At Adani, we are building on our foundation in data centres and green energy to expand into the complete five-layer AI stack focused on India's technological sovereignty.

Hair transplant costs in Turkey 2026: A transparent breakdown (no hidden fees),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hair-transplant-costs-in-turkey-2026-a-transparent-breakdown-no-hidden-fees/articleshow/128420641.cms,"Why Turkey is one of the leading destinations for hair transplant



Understanding the different hair transplant methods

FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction): In this method, single hair roots are taken from the back or sides of the head and moved to the areas where hair is thin or missing. FUE is popular because it leaves very small scars and gives a natural look. The cost of FUE in Turkey is usually between $1,500 and $4,000, depending on the number of hair roots required.



DHI (Direct Hair Implantation): A newer method in which hair roots are inserted directly into the scalp using a special pen-shaped tool. This way is more exact and helps more hair roots survive. Because DHI is more detailed, it usually costs more than FUE. In Turkey, DHI usually costs between $2,000 and $5,500.



Factors that influence hair transplant costs in Turkey

Number of grafts: One of the most significant factors that influences the cost is the number of hair follicles (grafts) that need to be transplanted. Generally, the more grafts required, the higher the cost. For example, if you need a large number of grafts for extensive hair restoration, the price will increase accordingly.



Clinic reputation and surgeon experience: The clinic's name and the doctor's experience also affect the price. Top clinics with famous and skilled doctors may charge more. Still, this can be worth it because experienced doctors are more likely to deliver natural-looking results and fewer complications.



Location: The clinic's location in Turkey can also affect the price. Istanbul, which is the main city for medical visitors, usually has higher prices than smaller cities. Still, the price difference is usually small, and you can get great care anywhere in the country.



All-inclusive packages: Many clinics in Turkey offer packages for international clients that include everything. These packages usually cover the surgery, travel, hotel, and post-surgery care. Even if the price looks higher, these packages often give you more for your money because they include extra services that make things easier.



Why transparency in pricing is crucial

Hair loss is a concern for many individuals, and as hair restoration technology advances, more people are opting for hair transplant surgeries to regain their confidence. One of the most sought-after destinations for these procedures is Turkey, which has become a global leader in hair transplants. But while hair transplant in Turkey offers high-quality services at an affordable price, it’s essential for patients to understand the cost breakdown.Before looking at the costs, it’s important to know why hair transplants in Turkey are so popular. Turkey is known for being affordable, having skilled doctors, and using the latest technology.Hair transplants in Turkey cost a fraction of what they would in other countries, such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Despite this significant price difference, Turkey offers the same high standards of care and expertise, making it the go-to choice for individuals seeking hair restoration procedures.The cost of a hair transplant in Turkey changes based on a few things, like which method is used, how much hair you have lost, and which clinic you pick. The two most common methods for hair transplantation are Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) and Direct Hair Implantation (DHI). These methods differ in how they are performed and in cost.The price difference between FUE and DHI mostly depends on how skilled the doctor is, what kind of equipment the clinic uses, and how much hair you have lost. Sometimes, DHI costs more because it needs more careful work.While the chosen method plays a significant role in determining cost, other factors also contribute to the overall price of a hair transplant in Turkey. Here’s a breakdown of what you should expect:When choosing a hair transplant in Turkey, clear pricing is very important. Many people from other countries worry about hidden fees or surprise costs. The best clinics in Turkey ensure they provide clear pricing so patients know exactly what to expect before surgery.Good clinics will give you a clear list of all costs, including extras like travel, hotel, and post-surgery care. If a clinic offers a package that includes everything, make sure the price covers the first visit, the surgery, and post-surgery care.You should also be careful with clinics that have very low prices. Even though Turkey is affordable, prices much lower than normal might indicate poor service or doctors with little experience. Always choose quality and skill over just a low price to get the best results.When thinking about a hair transplant in Turkey, Dr. Serkan Aygin’s clinic is one of the best choices for people from other countries. Dr. Aygin is a well-known expert in hair restoration, known for his meticulous work, personal attention, and outstanding results.

China Buys More Russian Crude As India Steps Back

Even as US President Donald Trump wants the world to stop buying crude oil from Russia, China’s purchases of Russian crude are set to hit a new record in February. China’s procurement of Russian crude is expected to rise for a third consecutive month in February, reaching a fresh record as independent refiners increase buying of heavily discounted cargoes.Shipments of Russian oil to China are projected at about 2.07 million barrels per day for February delivery. This is more than January’s estimated 1.7 million barrels per day, based on preliminary assessments by Vortexa Analytics. Separate provisional figures from Kpler indicate imports of roughly 2.083 million barrels per day in February, compared with 1.718 million barrels per day a month earlier.This comes amidst India reducing its intake, according to traders and vessel-tracking data quoted by Reuters.Data from Kpler shows India’s imports of Russian crude are likely to decline further to around 1.159 million barrels per day in February. The reduced demand has pushed Russian crude prices lower, with cargoes for January and February delivery to China trading at discounts of $9 to $11 per barrel to benchmark ICE Brent.These discounts are among the deepest seen in recent years for the Urals grade, which is shipped from European ports and had typically been directed to India because of shorter shipping distances compared with China.Since November, China has overtaken India as Russia’s largest buyer of seaborne crude. Western sanctions linked to the war in Ukraine, along with pressure on New Delhi to advance a trade agreement with the United States, prompted India to scale back Russian oil purchases to a two-year low in December, the Reuters report said.Also Read | Trump removes 25% penal tariff: What happens if India stops buying Russian crude oil? Supplies of Urals, along with other export grades such as Sokol and Varandey, have added to regular shipments of Russia’s flagship ESPO blend exported from the Far East port of Kozmino, which is geographically closer to China. This has intensified competition with rival crude supplies from Iran.Concerns over potential US military action against Iran have unsettled China’s independent refiners, commonly referred to as teapots, which are among the largest buyers globally of oil subject to US sanctions from Russia, Iran and Venezuela.According to a senior Chinese trader who frequently supplies these refiners, Russian crude has recently gained a competitive edge over Iranian oil in terms of processing quality relative to price. The trader noted that the ESPO blend was last traded at discounts of about $8 to $9 per barrel to ICE Brent for March deliveries, while Iranian Light — a comparable grade — was assessed at roughly $10 to $11 below the same benchmark.Market uncertainty since January regarding the possibility of US strikes on Iran, in the event that nuclear negotiations fail to meet Washington’s expectations, has made Chinese teapots and traders more cautious about purchasing Iranian cargoes, said Emma Li, China analyst at Vortexa.She explained that concerns over potential disruptions to Iranian oil loadings in the event of military tensions have made Russian supplies appear more dependable to buyers. Li also indicated that part of the recent increase in Russian crude purchases has come from larger independent refiners located outside Shandong, the main hub for teapot refiners.Vortexa estimated that Iranian oil shipments to China, often labelled as Malaysian by traders to bypass US sanctions, declined to around 1.03 million barrels per day this month, compared with approximately 1.25 million barrels per day in January.","China’s procurement of Russian crude is expected to rise for a third consecutive month in February.

Asian markets showed little movement on Monday as several trading floors closed for Lunar New Year celebrations. Japan's disappointing economic growth of just 0.1 per cent in late 2025 added pressure on newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Meanwhile, US markets will stay shut for Presidents' Day, and gold prices dipped slightly after reaching $5,000 per ounce.The holiday closures affected mainland China, Seoul, and Taipei, while Hong Kong and Singapore operated only half-day sessions. The slow trading day followed a tech sector decline last week, triggered by worries about massive AI infrastructure investments.Japan's weak GDP numbers fell short of the expected 0.4% growth, creating challenges for Takaichi, who won recent elections promising economic improvement.""The weak growth implies that the large supplementary budget passed at the end of November provided no boost to public spending last quarter just yet,"" said Marcel Thieliant at Capital Economics. He suggested Takaichi might need to act quickly on tax reforms and new budgets.Most Asian markets saw minor losses. Tokyo dropped 0.03%, while Hong Kong managed a 0.4% gain. The market mood improved after US inflation data showed a bigger-than-expected cooling in January.The AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, featuring tech leaders like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Google's Sundar Pichai, starts Monday. The event comes amid growing concerns about AI's social and environmental impacts, despite its role in boosting tech company profits.""US inflation data was good.

Global oil prices remained steady on Monday as markets closely watch upcoming talks between United States and Iran.

The day saw Brent crude futures slightly down at $67.72 per barrel, while US WTI crude stood at $62.86.The market's cautious stance comes ahead of crucial negotiations between Washington and Tehran in Geneva on Tuesday.

China Defies UN Sanctions, Helps Iran Rearm After War With Israel, Says Report

US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House on Wednesday to reportedly discuss plans for reducing Iran's oil sales to China, which currently handles over 80 per cent of Iran's oil exports. The agreement comes amid ongoing nuclear talks between US and Iranian officials through Omani mediators.A senior US official told Axios, ""We agreed that we will go full force with maximum pressure against Iran, for example, regarding Iranian oil sales to China,"" as reported by Reuters. This move could significantly impact Iran's oil revenue.The diplomatic efforts coincide with the US positioning a naval fleet in the region. The American military is said to be preparing for potential extended operations against Iran that could last several weeks, according to various media reports.China's response to these developments remains unknown, as no official statement has been given amid the Lunar New Year holiday.In a separate development around US-Iran relations, exiled son of Iran’s last shah Reza Pahlavi, on Saturday called on US President Donald Trump to help the Iranian people, saying it was “time to end the Islamic republic.”Speakingat the Munich Security Conference, Pahlavi said, “It is time to end the Islamic republic.”“This is the demand echoing from the bloodshed of my compatriots who are not asking us to fix the regime but to help them bury it,” he added, as quoted by AFP.Reza Pahlavi directly appealed to Donald Trump, telling reporters, “The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them.”Earlier, Trump had said on Friday that a change of government in Iran would be “the best thing that could happen,” as a second aircraft carrier was deployed to the Middle East to intensify military pressure on the Islamic republic. He had earlier warned of possible military action in support of nationwide protests that peaked in January and were followed by a harsh crackdown that rights groups say left thousands dead.","US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House on Wednesday.

China will remove tariffs on imports from almost all African countries starting May 1, Chinese President Xi Jinping said, according to state media, in a move expected to deepen trade and economic engagement between Beijing and the continent, AFP reported.China already operates a zero-tariff policy for imports from 33 African countries, but Beijing had announced last year that it would expand the policy to all 53 African countries with which it has diplomatic relations.Under the expanded framework, zero levies will apply to all African nations except Eswatini, which maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan. China claims the democratic island as its own and has not ruled out the use of force to assert control over it.China remains Africa’s largest trading partner and has played a major role in infrastructure development across the continent through its Belt and Road Initiative.The move comes at a time when several African countries are diversifying trade relationships, particularly after US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs globally last year.Xi said the zero-tariff arrangement “will undoubtedly provide new opportunities for African development”, while announcing the timeline as leaders across Africa gathered in Ethiopia for the annual African Union summit.The expansion of tariff-free access is expected to strengthen China’s economic influence in Africa while boosting trade flows and market access for African exporters.","China will remove tariffs on imports from almost all African countries starting May 1.

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence

The economy of Pakistan is in a risky state due to its over-reliance on short-term foreign loans, according to business leaders and economists. Key figures are calling for urgent negotiations with friendly nations to extend loan repayment periods and implement structural reforms, as reported by Express Tribune.Vice chairman of the Pakistan industrial and traders associations front (PIAF) Raja Waseem Hassan warned that without extending loan maturities, the country will continue to face balance-of-payments problems. While foreign reserves have grown to $21 billion in January 2026, experts say this improvement relies too heavily on temporary support from international institutions and friendly countries.""The government must immediately begin serious negotiations with friendly nations to secure longer repayment periods and ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves,"" said Hassan. He welcomed recent positive diplomatic developments with Gulf states and the United States but cautioned that these relationships can change quickly.The country's trade performance remains concerning. Exports stood at $32 billion in FY25, while imports continue to exceed export earnings. Dr. Saleem Ahmed, a senior economist, warned that Pakistan can't rely forever on rollovers and short-term deposits. He suggests the country needs 5-6 per cent annual growth to stabilize its debt-to-GDP ratio, which currently hovers around 70 per cent.Economic growth prospects remain modest. The IMF expects 3.6% GDP growth for FY26, while the State Bank of Pakistan projects 3.75-4.75%. Though inflation has dropped from its 38% peak in 2023, strict monetary policies have slowed industrial growth and business lending.Experts recommended focusing on export-oriented sectors like textiles, IT, and agricultural processing. They suggest improving tax collection, reducing energy waste, and boosting remittances, which could reach $42 billion in FY26. They also stress the need to increase foreign direct investment beyond its current annual level of $1.5-2 billion to reduce dependency on external borrowing.Hassan pointedout that while Pakistan's military importance can help in diplomacy, economic strength is crucial for long-term stability. ""Economic strength must be the real shield. Without strong buffers and self-reliance, external partnerships alone cannot guarantee stability,"" he said.","Pakistan's economy is in a risky state due to its over-reliance on short-term foreign loans.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 109 points, or 0.2%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3%, AP reported.Treasury yields declined in the bond market after data showed inflation cooled more than economists had expected last month. Consumer prices were 2.4% higher year-on-year, lower than December’s 2.7%, though still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. An underlying inflation measure — considered a better predictor of future price trends — slowed to its lowest level in nearly five years.“It’s still too high, but only for now, not forever,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management.Cooling inflation could provide the Federal Reserve greater room to cut interest rates if required. While the Fed has paused rate cuts for now, markets broadly expect easing to resume later this year.Lower borrowing costs could support economic growth and equity markets, though they also carry the risk of reigniting inflation.The broader economic backdrop also appears stronger compared to late 2025, supported by easing inflation and stronger-than-expected job market data last month.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell to 4.06% from 4.09% on Thursday.On Wall Street, stocks of companies previously seen as vulnerable to AI disruption stabilised. AppLovin rose 0.3% after losing nearly one-fifth of its value on Thursday despite reporting stronger-than-expected profits, as investors remained wary of AI-driven competitive threats.Freight and trucking stocks, which fell sharply on Thursday after AI platform claims of large productivity gains, also saw mild recovery. C.H. Robinson Worldwide rose 1.8% after dropping 14.5% a day earlier.Recent market moves have increasingly targeted sectors perceived to be vulnerable to AI disruption, with analysts describing the reaction as a “shoot first, ask questions later” approach.Chip equipment maker Applied Materials supported the market, rising 14.1% after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly profit. CEO Gary Dickerson attributed performance to rising investments linked to AI computing.On the downside, DraftKings fell 14.9% despite beating profit estimates, after issuing revenue guidance for the year that fell short of expectations.Globally, equity markets were weaker. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng declined 1.7%, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.2%.","The S&P 500 was nearly unchanged in early trade, a day after recording one of its worst losses since Thanksgiving. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 109 points, or 0.2%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128312892,imgsize-1442990,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"US adds Alibaba, Baidu to military-linked firms list supporting China: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-adds-alibaba-baidu-to-military-linked-firms-list-report/articleshow/128312386.cms,"‘Trump Knew…’: US Leaks Own Plot Against Khamenei, ‘Smuggled 6000+ Starlinks Amid Iran Protest’

The administration of US President Donald Trump has added several major Chinese companies, including Alibaba and Baidu, to a Pentagon list of firms allegedly supporting China’s military, increasing pressure on Beijing ahead of an expected meeting between leaders of the two countries, according to a Reuters report.The Pentagon’s 1260H list does not directly impose sanctions on the companies. However, under a new US law, the Department of Defense will be barred in the coming years from contracting with or procuring from companies included on the list.Other companies added on Friday include automaker BYD, biotech firm WuXi AppTec and AI-driven robotics company RoboSense Technology Co Ltd. Meanwhile, memory chip maker YMTC was removed from the list.Inclusion in the list also signals to Pentagon suppliers and other US government agencies the military’s assessment of these firms. Some companies listed earlier have challenged their inclusion through legal routes.Responding to the move, an Alibaba spokesperson told Reuters that there was no basis for the inclusion and indicated possible legal action. “Alibaba is not a Chinese military company nor part of any military-civil fusion strategy.”The update to the list could strain ties between Washington and Beijing, particularly after a trade truce agreed between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in October.The list already includes major Chinese firms such as Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL. Tencent had earlier said its business would remain unaffected and that it would seek reconsideration, while CATL said it was “not engaged in any military-related activities”.US lawmakers had earlier urged the Pentagon to expand the list to include several Chinese technology companies, including AI firm DeepSeek, smartphone maker Xiaomi and display manufacturer BOE Technology.Along with YMTC, some firms included last year --such as COSCO SHIPPING Finance Co Ltd and ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc -- have now been removed from the list.","US President Donald Trump has added several major Chinese companies to a Pentagon list of firms allegedly supporting China's military.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024. With generative AI (GenAI) acceleration, 70 per cent of start-up founders are embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in their solutions.As funding becomes scarce for the Indian startup ecosystem in general, the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given a new lease of life to entrepreneurs and founders in the country, as the Centre extends support to the sector.","The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

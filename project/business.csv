Key Expectations from Union Budget 2025 for Education Sector

AI Integration in Education

“A significant increase in AI funding—potentially 5-10% of the overall education budget—is required to match the ambitious goals outlined in NEP 2020. This investment should prioritize high-speed internet access, advanced digital tools, and dedicated AI labs in schools and colleges,”

Investing in Innovation and Teacher Training

“It’s widely accepted that the traditional school system is obsolete. India must leapfrog, not just catch up, by bridging the gap between technology and education, 21st-century skills and today’s schools, and workforce needs and academia. We must create models of excellence—schools that exemplify what the future of education should be,”

“Leapfrogging won’t happen unless teachers and school leaders are ready, equipped, and energized to drive that transformation. This year’s budget must focus not only on capacity building but also on redefining the teacher’s role,”

GST Exemption and Affordable Education for Disadvantaged Students

“The 18% tax slab on higher and online education is excessive. Countries like Switzerland offer free education services, while China’s education tax rate is just 6%. India should take inspiration and make learning more accessible,”





Boosting Startups and Skill Development

Upgrading 1,000 Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) under a hub-and-spoke model.

Aligning course content with industry skill requirements.

Launching a centrally sponsored scheme under the Prime Minister’s skilling package.

Collaborating with state governments and industries to skill 20 lakh students over five years.

“It’s time for the government to ‘walk the talk’ by providing tangible support—financial subsidies, grants, and incubation assistance—to startups working on next-gen technologies like AI in education,”

Addressing Digital Gaps and Skill Development

“The Union Budget must focus on empowering education by bridging digital gaps. A reduction in GST on education services is essential to make learning affordable for middle-class families. Additionally, targeted investments in rural internet infrastructure are critical to integrating underserved communities into the digital economy,”

“Skilling initiatives in areas like digital literacy, green energy, and logistics will boost employability and drive long-term economic growth,”

As India gears up for the Union Budget 2025 , the general public eagerly anticipates significant reforms across various sectors, particularly in education. Expectations include reducing GST on education services, bridging the skill gap, boosting vocational training platforms, enhancing digital infrastructure, investing in innovation, improving teacher training, and reforming higher education and research.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present her eighth budget speech on February 1, 2025, with significant announcements expected for the education sector.In the Union Budget 2024, she emphasized the government's focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class for the next five years. Specifically, employment and skilling were identified as the second priority of the Modi government, with an allocation of ₹1.48 lakh crore for education, employment, and skill development.In March 2024, the Union Cabinet approved a ₹10,371.92 crore investment for the India Artificial Intelligence (AI) Mission to establish a robust AI ecosystem. The initiative, aligned with the vision of “Making AI in India” and “Making AI Work for India,” will be implemented by the Independent Business Division (IBD) under the Digital India Corporation (DIC). Key components include AI Compute Capacity, AI Innovation Centre, AI Datasets Platform, AI Application Development Initiative, AI FutureSkills, AI Startup Financing, and Safe & Trusted AI.With India’s education system on the brink of a technological revolution, the Union Budget 2025 is expected to reinforce AI’s integration into learning.Mridu Andotra, Founder & CEO of GeniusMentor, highlights that a dedicated budget allocation for AI in schools and colleges is necessary to empower India’s youth and establish the country as a global AI leader.Andotra said.Additionally, she emphasized that educator upskilling in AI pedagogy and hands-on AI learning experiences for students should be key priorities.Sandeep Rai, Founder of The Circle India, an NGO focused on transforming education for underserved communities, underscored the urgent need for investments in innovation to modernize schools.Rai stated.He further stressed the importance of teacher training and leadership development, urging the government to invest in preparing educators for meaningful change.he added.The financial accessibility of education is another crucial area. Prateek Maheshwari, Co-Founder of PhysicsWallah, advocates for a 100% GST exemption on educational expenses, including test-prep courses and job-oriented skill programs, for students from Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Low-Income Group (LIG) families.Maheshwari noted.In September 2023, UGC Chairman M. Jagadesh Kumar announced the goal of increasing India’s Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) to 50% by 2035. However, high tax rates create barriers to access, discouraging students from pursuing higher education.In the Union Budget 2024, the government introduced financial assistance of up to ₹10 lakh for higher education through e-vouchers and a 3% interest subsidy for one lakh students annually. Maheshwari urges that the Union Budget 2025 should focus on making degrees more affordable and rationalizing student loan interest rates, including interest-free loans for economically weaker students.The Union Budget 2024 introduced several initiatives for skill development, such as:To build on these efforts, the Union Budget 2025 should prioritize tangible support for startups, including financial subsidies, grants, and incubation assistance.Ram Ramalingam, Founder & CMO of GeniusMentor, emphasized that ed-tech startups will directly impact India’s global workforce quality.he said.Anthony Fernandes, Founder of Shaalaa.com, highlighted the need for strengthening digital infrastructure and skilling initiatives.Fernandes stated.He also underscored the need for vocational training platforms to address India’s growing skill gap.he concluded.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present her eighth budget speech on February 1, 2025, with significant announcements expected for the education sector.

Tax experts and economists have also been advocating for further rationalisation of income tax slabs under the new income tax regime, and a hike in standard deduction to give more disposable income in the hands of the middle class.Any changes in the income tax slabs and income tax rates, if they come, are likely only under the new income tax regime since the government has been pushing for its adoption. As per government data, 72% taxpayers have switched to the new income tax regime.Union Budget 2025 comes at a time when the GDP growth has slowed to a two year low of 5.4% and a cut in income tax rates is being advocated as a way to boost consumption in the economy.This is the second Budget of the Modi 3.0 government and the eighth Budget for Nirmala Sitharaman as Finance Minister.All eyes are now on FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget 2025 speech to see if FY 2025-26 will be a year of lower income tax burden or not.","PM Modi’s mention of the middle class in the context of the Budget session, and a day ahead of the Union Budget speech, has left everyone wondering if Budget 2025 will provide a much-needed income tax relief to the common man.

The Budget also focusses on attracting more private investment in infrastructure by taking up projects on public-private partnership (PPP) mode.Going by budget estimate (BE), the govt's effective capital expenditure for FY26, including both the Centre and states, is projected at Rs 15.5 lakh crore, compared with the revised estimate (RE) for FY25 pegged at Rs 13.2 lakh crore.The RE is lower than the BE of Rs 15 lakh crore for FY25.In case of capex allocated for central govt departments for FY25, the RE has been reduced to Rs 10.2 lakh crore compared to the BE of Rs 11.1 lakh crore as key infrastructure ministries were unable to meet targets.The Economic Survey on Friday had flagged slow down in capex in the first quarter due to Lok Sabha polls and the extended monsoon.Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the high allocation for capex shows how govt's priority is on infrastructure development.As the govt is keen in attracting private investment in infrastructure, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget speech, said, ""Each infrastructure-related ministry will come up with a three-year pipeline of projects that can be implemented in PPP mode.

She unveiled several initiatives aimed at boosting the sector, including the Prime Minister Dhan-Dhaanya Krishi Yojana, a scheme designed to target regions with low farm productivity.The plan, in partnership with states, aims to reach an estimated 10.7 million farmers.Other initiatives include a six-year mission for pulses self-sufficiency, a five-year mission to boost cotton productivity, creation of a Makhana Board in Bihar to augment production, productivity and processing, and a comprehensive programme to promote horticulture productionOn the surface, the initiatives outlined in the budget appear to be a step in the right direction. Yet, while these efforts are commendable, they seem like incremental moves rather than the big, bold, transformative changes needed to revolutionize the agricultural sector in India. This budget could be seen as a missed opportunity to take a more radical approach that could significantly reshape the future of farming in the country.The Budget allocation for the ministry of agriculture and farmers' welfare was reduced by 2.5%. For FY26, the total allocation stood at Rs 1.37 lakh crore, a slight decrease from the revised estimates (RE) of Rs 1.41 lakh crore in FY25. This amounts to just 2.7% of the total budget expenditure (Rs 50.6 lakh crore) and 4.8% of net tax revenue (Rs 28.3 lakh crore) in FY26. This reduction is confusing as it indicates a lack of urgency in addressing deeper challenges facing the agriculture sector.Notwithstanding this, ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry, and dairying saw a significant 37% increase in Budget allocation, from Rs 5,505.7 crore in FY25 to Rs 7,544 crore in FY26. This shift indicates govt's intention to promote growth in dairy and fishery sectors, where India is already a major global player. India is the second-largest producer of fish and aquaculture, with seafood exports worth Rs 60,000 crore. The increased Budget allocation will be used to support sustainable fishing practices, especially in the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone and High Seas, with a particular focus on the Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands. This is a commendable and forward looking step.However, upon examining the broader agri-food budget for FY26, it becomes clear that govt's approach still heavily revolves around welfare measures and subsidies. For instance, food and fertiliser subsidies continue to consume a significant portion of the Budget. The food subsidy for FY26 has been pegged at a budgeted estimate (BE) of Rs 2.03 lakh crore, up by 3% from Rs 1.97 lakh crore in FY25 (RE). This focus on consumer subsidies overlooks the fundamental issues that farmers face.While the FM announced reopening of three dormant urea plants in the eastern region and setting up of a new plant with annual capacity of 12.7 lakh tonnes at Namrup, Assam, these are positive steps toward improving self-sufficiency. However, more pressing question remains whether the current fertiliser subsidy policy is effectively promoting the right usage of fertilisers.The fertiliser subsidy, meanwhile, has been reduced from Rs 1.83 lakh crore in FY25 (RE) to Rs 1.56 lakh crore for FY26 (BE). While this reduction may seem like a positive step towards fiscal prudence, the reality of this policy's impact on farmers remains uncertain. Given that India imports around 80% of its natural gas for urea production, fluctuations in global gas prices will continue to heavily influence the cost of fertilisers. Furthermore, the heavy subsidisation of urea - often at the expense of other nutrients like phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) - has led to an unbalanced fertiliser usage pattern across the country. Recommended N,P,K dose (in kg/hectare) in Punjab is 118, 51 and 33, but actual is 190, 47.1 and 3.7. Similar distortion is there is other states, impacting soil health and productivity.The real challenge lies in whether govt can pivot from its current fertiliser subsidy regime to a more efficient and sustainable approach. One potential solution could involve direct cash transfers to farmers. This model would empower farmers to purchase fertilisers at market prices, thereby reducing leakage (currently at 20-30%) and ensuring that the subsidy is used more efficiently.Moreover, govt should encourage the use of technological innovations, such as nano-urea and nano-diammonium phosphate, which can help balance nutrient usage and reduce the environmental damage caused by excess nitrogen use. By allowing fertiliser prices to be determined by market forces, would not only promote better nutrient use but also help restore the right balance of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in soils. However, such a shift would require strong communication efforts to build trust among farmers and ensure their understanding of the long-term benefits.Overall, while the Budget offers several positive steps for agriculture, it does not seize the opportunity to bring about a comprehensive transformation in the sector. The focus on welfare measures and subsidies, though important, may not be enough to drive lasting change. Now is the time to shift the focus from short-term relief to long-term sustainability.(Gulati and Juneja are distinguished professor and fellow, ICRIER, respectively.

However, it is purely theoretical for someone earning Rs 12.75 lakh to invest in tax savings schemes , avail HRA (Rs 3,82,500), and standard deduction, chalking it up to Rs 9,57,000.However, as the tax incidences under the new scheme go up sharply after the Rs 12 lakh level, the decision to pay tax under the old regime would make sense only if the taxpayer invests Rs 5.25 lakh in tax saving schemes.Even if the taxpayer with income of Rs 13.75 lakh does not avail of HRA, his tax liability at Rs 57,500 under old system will be lower than the outgo of Rs 75,000 under the new regime. Same is true for income up to Rs 15.75 lakh, where the tax liability without HRA in the old system will be lower than the new regime but the rider of Rs 5.25 lakh investment in savings schemes holds. Even with HRA, old regime would be a better choice.The picture changes at incomes of Rs 20 lakh (Rs 20.75 lakh for salaried) where new tax regime will be beneficial over the old. Setting HRA aside, a taxpayer's liability on income of Rs 20 lakh will be Rs 2,40,000 under old system even after investing Rs 5.25 lakh in savings scheme, against Rs 2 lakh in the new system, where no deductions are allowed.At the income level of Rs 24 lakh also, the taxpayer will save Rs 60,000 under the new regime. Under the old system, his tax liability after investing the maximum possible of Rs 5.25 lakh in savings schemes will be Rs 3.60 lakh as against Rs 3 lakh in the old scheme.Above the income of Rs 15,75,000, if a taxpayer is claiming HRA of more than Rs 3 lakh, he should opt for old tax system provided he invests Rs 5.25 lakh in savings schemes.","Budget proposes tax rebate of Rs 60,000 on income up to Rs 12 lakh (and Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried people) New tax regime is better than old even if one is availing maximum possible deductions of Rs 5,75,000 and 30% of salary as house rent allowance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117842799,imgsize-67370,width-400,resizemode-4/117842799.jpg"

Can A Travis Kelce Proposal To Taylor Swift Indicate That Super Bowl Is Rigged?

Swifties have probably been dreaming about this moment ever since news of Taylor Swift ’s relationship with Travis Kelce went viral. But if Travis does propose to Taylor during the Super Bowl, chances are, it will land the NFL in a spot of trouble, as per sports journalist Matt Perrault. The Grammy winner has been dating the Kansas City Chiefs tight end since September 2023 and Taylor will most likely be in attendance when the Chiefs face the Philadelphia Eagles at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on February 9.But if Kansas wins and Travis ends up proposing to Taylor, Perrault believes it will hint at the game being rigged.Taylor and Travis have been going solid for a while and though fans speculated Travis may have proposed to Taylor during her 35th birthday bash, there have been no reports of their engagement. There’s a chance the Chiefs star wants to make a dramatic, Hollywood-inspired proposal on the field, right after the team wins, if they win, that is. But considering the Super Bowl is one of the most important sporting events in American sports and given Taylor’s fame, a Super Bowl proposal may be deemed as a PR stunt, Perrault says on his X page.Responding to a betting post which was speculating whether the two will get engaged during the Super Bowl, Perrault wrote, “If this happens - the whole relationship is PR stunt like I feared. No way Taylor wants this done in public given her desire privacy needs.”Also Read: Travis Kelce to ditch Taylor Swift at the Grammys as he prepares for Super Bowl LIX An estimated 123.7 million viewers tuned in for last year’s Super Bowl, according to average audience estimates from Nielsen, so a televised proposal would be rating gold for NFL. And Taylor and Travis have been seeing each other for 18 months, which has led fans to speculate that the two may get engaged very soon. And a Super Bowl proposal does have a romantic ring to it. But there are currently no reports which indicate that Travis and Taylor may get engaged at all this year, that too during one of the most important games in Kelce’s career. So Swifties may not get to witness the moment they are waiting for.",Travis Kelce has been dating Taylor Swift since September 2023.

Both Alex Bregman And Pete Alonso Receive Deals From The Toronto Blue Jays, As Per Famous MLB Insider, Hector Gomez



Alex Bregman And Pete Alonso’s Situation With Their MLB Agent, Scott Boras, As They Remain Free Agents



Alex Bregman rejected a deal worth $156 million offered by the Houston Astros while Pete Alonso rejected a $70 million deal offered by the New York Mets. Alex and Pete are two of the most talented and popular players in Major League Baseball who have coincidentally found themselves dealing with the same issue of free agency as fans speculate their next move.But it seems like, they might sign a deal together soon with one of the strongest teams in the MLB - the Toronto Blue Jays .As per MLB Insider, Hector Gomez’s recent post on X, the Toronto Blue Jays have offered a three year deal to Pete Alonso and a six year deal to Alex Bregman. It has been a couple of weeks since the Toronto Blue Jays had expressed interest in both Alex Bregman and Pete Alonso but the real question remains - will the star players finally sign with the Blue Jays?Fans are pretty divided about this speculation; a fan took to X and wrote, “It's clear Alonso is still in talks with the Mets trying to get a deal done...if not he would have taken the #BlueJays deal.”Another fan also expressed doubt whether Pete Alonso and Alex Bregman would pick the Toronto Blue Jays over other teams. The fan wrote, “Either of them, but more than likely, neither of them.”But this is not all; fans are also pretty worried about Vladimir Guerrero Jr. if in case both Alex Bregman and Pete Alonso ends up joining the Toronto Blue Jays. A fan wrote, “Hector, if they sign both then what would happen to Vladdy Jr this season?”As per reports, the Toronto Blue Jays are “in talks” with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. for a contract extension but nothing has been confirmed yet.Both Alex Bregman and Pete Alonso share the same sports agency, the Boras Corporation, which is led by Scott Boras. Scott has been slammed by fans as people blame him for Alex Bregman and Pete Alonso’s current situation. Many even believed that the two might fire Scott Boras soon. While nothing is known about Alex Bregman’s situation, apparently Pete Alonso wishes to continue working with Scott Boras , as per Ben Nicholson Smith of Sportsnet.Ben Nicholson Smith recently made a post on X that read as, “A source said MLB agents have recently been informed they cannot contact Pete Alonso. This would have to be initiated by Alonso himself. Evidently, Alonso wants to continue working with his agent Scott Boras without hearing from other agents looking to poach him.”With Spring Training being a couple of days away, the star players have to come to a final decision and sign a deal soon.Also Read: Is Pete Alonso using the New York Mets as leverage to get a better deal?

The crypto market is a dynamic space conducive to growth and innovation. Here are four new crypto coins that demand attention this quarter.Whales are a constant challenge in the meme coin market. They try to manipulate meme coin prices by flexing their capital and leaving small investors to pick up the pieces. This has to change, declares Wall Street Pepe.The project is on a mission to bring down the whales and establish the supremacy of the WEPE Army, a growing community of retail investors. The community membership comes with exclusive access to trading signals, alpha calls, and market insights that help navigate the unpredictable crypto market.In essence, Wall Street Pepe combines humour with purpose to create a noteworthy meme coin project. WEPE’s record-breaking presale has raised over $58 million, attracting investors eager for more than just a quick laugh.While most meme coins ride on fleeting hype, WEPE has its eyes set on a long journey ahead. That’s what sets it apart from the crowd of new meme coins vying for attention. The platform is inspired by the wildly popular Pepe meme. However, unlike its inspiration, WEPE blends bold branding with practical value.The WEPE Army is creating a supportive community for both learning and earning. Weekly trading competitions, early presale access, and expert insights make it an attractive choice for crypto enthusiasts looking for an edge.The $WEPE presale is still live, offering discounted crypto tokens and a passive income mechanism.

He drew attention to the project’s standout features and why they could be a game-changer. Best Wallet is setting a new standard in crypto management.The Solana blockchain is popular, yes. But it is facing growing pains as its popularity soars. High demand has led to network congestion, delayed transactions, and increased fees.Solaxy is bringing the first Layer-2 solution to Solana. It takes a creative route to improve the blockchain’s performance. The platform uses roll-up technology to act as an off-ramp for Solana’s mainnet. The transactions are processed on a secondary chain, bundled together, and sent back for confirmation. Here is how it helps:The Solaxy ecosystem revolves around its native token, $SOLX. It powers not just transaction fees, but also governance mechanisms and passive rewards. Early investors can lock their tokens during the presale to earn attractive APYs. Over 3 billion tokens have already been locked, reflecting strong community interest in the project.While utility drives Solaxy, its meme coin persona is no less captivating.

Inflation pressures persist



Donald Trump inherits a healthy economy



Global comparison



The US economy wrapped up 2024 on a solid note, with consumer spending and government support playing key roles in driving growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department.Despite some challenges, the economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected. For the full year, GDP grew by 2.8%, a strong performance, although slightly down from the 2.9% growth in 2023.Consumer spending rose by 4.2% in the final quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since early 2023.This growth was up from 3.7% in the previous quarter. The economy also benefitted from government spending and continued investment, although business investment slowed, particularly in equipment spending, which fell sharply after two strong quarters.Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, said, ""Consumers have been the foundation of the economy, and they've been the biggest driver of resilient growth in 2024,"" as quoted by the AFP news agency. He believes this growth will continue, supported by low layoffs, healthy job growth, and rising wages.The report also showed ongoing inflation. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, increased by 2.5%, slightly up from 2.2% in the previous quarter.Despite these inflation pressures, the economy remained strong. A key part of GDP, which excludes volatile items like exports and inventories, grew by 3.2% in the third quarter, down from 3.4% in the previous quarter.President Donald Trump, who took office in January 2025, inherited a strong economy, with growth continuing despite high interest rates. Unemployment was 4.1% in December, and job gains stayed steady. The Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged in December, after cutting it three times since September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell was quoted as saying to the Associated Press, “We do not need to be in a hurry to make more cuts,” due to the economy’s strength.The US economy is growing strongly, while Europe is struggling, having seen zero growth at the end of last year. The European Central Bank recently lowered its benchmark rate due to weak performance. In the US, strong consumer spending, low unemployment, and rising wages have helped maintain growth, despite ongoing inflation concerns.Trump has promised to cut taxes and reduce business regulations, but his plans on tariffs and immigration might slow growth and raise prices. KPMG's chief economist, Diane Swonk, pointed out that the effects of these policies will take time. While some analysts expect growth to slow in 2025, they still believe the US economy will remain strong for now.","US economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected.

Tesla reported lower than expected profits Wednesday but confirmed key 2025 benchmarks, saying it will return to sales volume growth and move forward with fully autonomous driving.The results -- the first since the return of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ally Donald Trump to the White House -- capped a mixed year for Tesla in which Musk's big bet on US electoral politics was countered by profit pressures as Tesla's streak of annual car volume growth came to an end.The electric car company reported fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter, where profits were boosted by a one-time tax benefit.Revenues rose two percent to $25.7 billion, also missing analyst estimates, but reflecting a more than doubling of sales in energy generation and storage.Musk has sought to temper expectations about Tesla's near-term financial growth, while employing superlatives in touting Tesla's autonomous driving and robotic ventures, saying they could make Tesla ""the most valuable company in the world by far,"" worth more than the ""next five companies combined.""Musk, who spent some $270 million or more to help Trump win the White House, largely steered clear of political subjects during the 65-minute conference call.The company has been confronted by intensifying EV competition in leading markets, including China and the United States, where General Motors and Ford have introduced more models.Another factor has been lower sales than expected from the Cybertruck, Musk's futuristic auto giant that has won cheers from Tesla fans and jeers from critics.But Tesla expects growth in 2025, saying in its earnings release that ""with the advancements in vehicle autonomy and the introduction of new products, we expect the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025.""The company confirmed plans to unveil new, more affordable vehicles in 2025 and said its launch of a new robotaxi venture in parts of the United States was on track to begin this year.Tesla named its driver-assistance programs ""autopilot"" and ""full self-driving"" (FSD), even though the programs require the driver to maintain attention, while rival robotaxi venture Waymo has achieved full driverless functionality in three US cities so far.Musk has repeatedly missed earlier targets towards full autonomy, quipping during Wednesday that he was like the boy who cried wolf.""But I'm telling you, there's a damn wolf this time, and you can drive it,"" Musk said. ""In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf.""Musk said he intends to launch FSD as a paid service in Austin, Texas this year, where the company also plans to introduce robotaxi services.""Teslas will be in the wild,"" he said, describing a gradual expansion of service once the company can demonstrate its autonomous service is ""unequivocally safer"" than a human driver.Musk did not directly comment on how his alliance with Trump will affect Tesla.The billionaire's widening influence and activism on behalf of far-right political movements has drawn rising attention and blowback. Polling data released Wednesday by YouGov showed Musk with a 44 percent favorable public opinion compared with a 48 percent negative.That's a worse ratio than Trump, who came in at three points net-positive, according to YouGov.A coalition that includes a public workers union has filed a lawsuit to block Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, arguing the panel flouts federal laws and is ""beset"" by the conflicts of interest of an extremist ""libertarian billionaire class.""And only days after being criticized for a hand gesture at Trump's inauguration that resembled a Nazi salute, Musk drew scrutiny last weekend for reiterating support for Germany's far-right, anti-immigrant AfD party, including comments that young Germans should feel able ""to move beyond"" expressing regret for the Holocaust.During the call, Musk's most overtly political comment concerned what he described as the cumbersome process to introduce FSD in Europe, calling Europe ""a layer cake of regulations and bureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed.""Shares of Tesla rose 4.4 percent in after-hours trading.","Tesla reports fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter.

Poll Do You Believe DeepSeek's Success Will Lead to More Global AI Competition? No, Nvidia Will Continue to Lead Yes, It Could Disrupt the Current AI Market

Why it matters

DeepSeek’s AI is more than just another chatbot—it’s a symbol of China’s growing technological self-sufficiency. Its breakthrough challenges the long-standing assumption that the US holds an insurmountable lead in artificial intelligence.

At the core of US confidence was the belief that China needed American technology—particularly advanced semiconductors from Nvidia—to train competitive AI models. To maintain its dominance, Washington banned the export of high-end AI chips to China in 2022 and further tightened restrictions in 2023. Many assumed these moves would kneecap China’s AI ambitions.

Yet, DeepSeek has shattered that certainty. The company claims it trained its AI model using only 2,000 Nvidia chips , whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models. Even more astonishingly, OpenAI reportedly spent $1 billion on training ChatGPT, while DeepSeek did it with just about $6 million.

, whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models. Even more astonishingly, OpenAI reportedly spent $1 billion on training ChatGPT, while DeepSeek did it with just about $6 million. If these claims hold true, it could fundamentally reshape the AI industry. The assumption that cutting-edge AI requires enormous computing power, billion-dollar investments, and thousands of advanced chips may no longer be valid. Instead, DeepSeek has demonstrated that a highly efficient approach to AI training could level the playing field—allowing smaller players, and even adversarial nations, to catch up quickly.

Between the lines: How did DeepSeek pull this off?

1. A different approach to AI training:

This is akin to a search engine librarian:

2. A strategic stockpile of Nvidia chips

3. China’s ‘AI super geeks’ approach

A Trojan horse?

The rise of DeepSeek raises a troubling question for Washington: Could this technology be a Trojan horse? Under Chinese law, all tech companies are required to “cooperate with national intelligence efforts.” This means that any data fed into DeepSeek’s chatbot could, in theory, be accessible to the Chinese state.

Some analysts fear that DeepSeek’s chatbot could function as an AI-powered intelligence-gathering tool, subtly siphoning off user information under the guise of casual interactions. Others point to its built-in political censorship—when asked about topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre or China’s treatment of Uyghurs, DeepSeek either refuses to answer or echoes the Chinese government’s official stance.

With TikTok already under scrutiny in the US for alleged data harvesting, DeepSeek’s explosive rise is triggering similar concerns. The White House’s AI task force is reportedly investigating whether the platform poses a national security risk. “We should be alarmed,” said Ross Burley, co-founder of the Centre for Information Resilience. “Beijing has repeatedly weaponized its tech dominance for surveillance, control, and coercion,” Burley told Guardian.

What they’re saying

DeepSeek’s sudden rise has sparked polarizing reactions across the tech world:

President Donald Trump: Called DeepSeek a ""wake-up call"" for US industries, warning that China’s AI leap could threaten American economic and national security.

Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO): Praised DeepSeek as “impressive” and welcomed the competition, despite previously framing AI development as a battle between democracy and authoritarianism.

Elon Musk: Expressed doubts, suggesting that DeepSeek downplayed its use of banned US chips.

US National Security Officials: Are now investigating potential data security risks, given that DeepSeek stores user data on servers in China—raising concerns about state surveillance.

What’s next?

DeepSeek’s rise throws a wrench into Washington’s AI strategy. The US has aggressively restricted China’s access to advanced AI chips, believing that these controls would slow Beijing’s progress. But DeepSeek’s breakthrough suggests that China has found ways to innovate despite these restrictions.

Stronger US export controls : The Trump administrations will likely tighten AI-related export bans.

: The Trump administrations will likely tighten AI-related export bans. Restrictions may expand beyond hardware, targeting software and cloud-based AI services to further limit China’s progress.

Increased scrutiny of Chinese AI companies: US and European regulators may investigate DeepSeek’s funding sources to determine whether the Chinese government played a role.

US and European regulators may investigate DeepSeek’s funding sources to determine whether the Chinese government played a role. Concerns over data security could lead to bans on DeepSeek’s AI in Western markets, similar to TikTok’s ongoing legal battles.

US push for AI supremacy: The DeepSeek shock may accelerate government funding for AI innovation.

The DeepSeek shock may accelerate government funding for AI innovation. Trump’s $500 billion ""Stargate"" AI initiative could gain bipartisan support as Washington scrambles to ensure US leadership in AI.

Bottom line

China’s AI industry has delivered a seismic shock to the world. DeepSeek , a little-known startup, has unveiled a generative AI model that is reportedly as powerful as OpenAI’s ChatGPT—but developed at a fraction of the cost. This breakthrough, described by Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen as a ""Sputnik moment,"" has rattled global tech markets.The fallout was immediate. US tech stocks suffered a bloodbath, losing nearly $1 trillion in value in a single day. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, saw $589 billion wiped off its market capitalization in what is now the largest one-day loss for any company in US history. The panic was fueled by fears that China’s AI could compete—and even surpass—US advancements while circumventing Washington’s chip restrictions.DeepSeek’s rise represents a stunning reversal of expectations. Just two years ago, China’s AI scene was seen as lagging behind the US. Beijing’s early attempts at ChatGPT-like models, such as Baidu’s Ernie and Tencent’s Hunyuan, were dismissed as inferior copies. Now, DeepSeek has positioned itself as a real contender, proving that China’s AI talent and research ecosystem are capable of groundbreaking innovation.DeepSeek’s success hinges on an unconventional training method. Traditional AI models process vast amounts of data, requiring massive computational resources. DeepSeek’s approach is different—it prioritizes knowing where to look for answers rather than memorizing everything.Traditional AI models behave like a librarian who has read every book in the library and pulls from memory to answer questions. DeepSeek’s model doesn’t read every book in advance. Instead, it quickly finds the right book when asked a question—a more efficient and cost-effective approach. This technique, combined with a “mixture of experts” strategy—which assigns specialized AI models to different types of questions—dramatically reduces the computing power needed to train AI.While the US tried to block China from accessing advanced AI chips, DeepSeek found a loophole. Before Washington closed the door in 2023, DeepSeek and other Chinese firms stockpiled tens of thousands of Nvidia’s A100 and H800 chips.These chips, though slightly less powerful than Nvidia’s cutting-edge H100, were still good enough for training DeepSeek’s AI. Some experts, including Elon Musk, have speculated that DeepSeek may have secretly acquired more high-end chips than disclosed.The brains behind DeepSeek is a 39-year-old Chinese hedge funder named Liang Wenfeng . As per a CNN report, in interviews with the state-linked financial outlet Yicai, early business associates described the future DeepSeek founder as somewhat “nerdy” and recalled “a terrible haircut” he once had.Liang Wenfeng believes in hiring fresh graduates over experienced professionals. His rationale?Experienced engineers follow conventional approaches. Young engineers are more willing to experiment and think outside the box. This philosophy appears to have worked. Liang’s team of under 140 researchers—mostly graduates from China’s elite universities—designed a breakthrough AI system in record time. Their success has boosted morale in China’s tech industry, with Liang now celebrated as one of China’s ""AI heroes.""DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough signals a shift in the global AI landscape. While it’s unclear if China will ultimately overtake the US in AI, one thing is certain: Silicon Valley’s AI monopoly is no longer guaranteed.(With inputs from agencies)","DeepSeek claims it trained its AI model using only 2,000 Nvidia chips, whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models.

'DeepSeek DID NOT build OpenAI for USD 5M' : Bernstein dismisses the Chinese company's claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/deepseek-did-not-build-openai-for-usd-5m-bernstein-dismisses-the-chinese-companys-claims/articleshow/117678472.cms,"Was it really $ 5 million?

DeepSeek, a new AI company seen as a potential rival to OpenAI, has gained massive success across social media, sending global stock markets into a frenzy. However, a recent report by Bernstein cautioned that while the company’s achievements are impressive, the claims of building an AI system comparable to OpenAI for just $5 million are not true.The report said that the claim is misleading and does not reflect the bigger picture.Bernstein stated, ""We believe that DeepSeek DID NOT ""build OpenAI for USD 5M""; the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and the resulting Twitter-verse panic over the weekend seems overblown"".The report said that DeepSeek developed two main AI models: the DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek R1. The V3 model, a large language model, utilises a mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture, which combines multiple smaller models to achieve high performance while using fewer computing resources than traditional large models.On the other hand, the V3 model boasts 671 billion parameters, with 37 billion active at any given time, and incorporated with innovations like multi-head latent attention (MHLA) to reduce memory usage and mixed-precision training with FP8 computation for greater efficiency.Training the V3 model involved a cluster of 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs over a two-month period which sums up around 5.5 million GPU hours.While some estimates put the training cost at approximately $ 5 million, the report highlighted that this figure only considers the computational resources, leaving out the significant costs related to research, experimentation, and other developmental expenses.The DeepSeek R1 model builds upon the V3’s foundation by using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and other techniques to enhance reasoning capabilities. The R1 model has performed competitively with OpenAI’s models in reasoning tasks. However, Bernstein pointed out that the additional resources required to develop the R1 model were substantial, though not detailed in DeepSeek’s research paper.Commenting on the hype, Bernstein noted that DeepSeek's models are impressive.For example, the V3 model performs as well as or better than other large models in language, coding, and mathematics while consuming a fraction of the computational resources. Pre-training the V3 model required just 2.7 million GPU hours, or only 9 per cent of the compute resources needed for some leading models.In conclusion, while DeepSeek’s advancements are noteworthy, the report urged caution in the face of exaggerated claims. While the company’s work is groundbreaking, the notion of creating an OpenAI competitor for just $ 5 million appears to be false.","DeepSeek, a new AI company seen as a potential rival to OpenAI, has gained massive success across social media, sending global stock markets into a frenzy. A recent report by Bernstein cautioned that while the company’s achievements are impressive, the claims of building an AI system comparable to Open AI for just $5 million are not true.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117678432,imgsize-44084,width-400,resizemode-4/117678432.jpg"

Despite inflation easing, the RBA’s official cash rate remains at 4.35 per cent, where it has sat since November 2023, according to news agency The Guardian.The last rate cut occurred in November 2020 as part of efforts to support the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.While inflation has not dropped as quickly as the RBA had hoped, it has steadily declined from its peak of 7.8 per cent in 2022, when Australian households struggled with soaring prices for essential goods.Analysts believe that the RBA may now have room to ease its monetary policy to prevent a downturn in the job market and avoid tipping the economy into recession.Saxo Bank’s Asia Pacific senior sales trader Junvum Kim said, “This softer-than-expected inflation data could amplify expectations for a February RBA rate cut and bolster the Reserve Bank’s confidence in steering inflation back to its target within a reasonable timeframe.”With Australia’s federal election due by May, the cost-of-living crisis remains a key issue for voters. Polling remains tight, and recent elections have shown that governments need strong policies to address financial pressures if they hope to stay in power.The financial markets were already biding in an 84 per cent chance of a 0.25 per cent cut ahead of the latest inflation data release, raising expectations for a policy shift in the coming weeks.The Australian dollar, which usually falls with the interest rates and vice versa, also fell from a little more than 62.5 US cents to 62.3 US cents.","The Reserve Bank of Australia ’s (RBA) preferred inflation measure, which excludes volatile price swings, dropped to an annual 3.2 per cent for the December quarter.

Three years ago, Liang Wenfeng 's quantitative hedge fund firm apologised profusely to investors for losing money during a tumultuous period for China's stock market.It was a surprising stumble for Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management , which used artificial intelligence to pick stocks and had grown rapidly to become one of the country's largest quant funds.As the firm navigated through that crisis and its assets shrunk by more than a third from a peak of more than $12 billion, behind the scenes Liang was laying the groundwork for a new AI startup, DeepSeek .DeepSeek, which grew out of High-Flyer, is now threatening to upend the global AI supply chain and challenge the seemingly-unassailable US lead in critical frontier AI technologies. The sudden popularity of the 20-month-old firm's breakthrough technology and its namesake app sparked a massive US and European stock rout on Monday, wiping out close to $1 trillion in combined market value from chip giant Nvidia and other peers.It has also drawn shock and awe over how Liang, an engineering graduate who has never studied or worked outside of mainland China, pulled off such a feat. He has demonstrated that with local artificial intelligence engineers, constrained access to the latest semiconductor technologies and limited resources, it is possible to match - and even surpass - the best in the field.The question now gripping investors, companies and policymakers is whether artificial intelligence requires hundreds of billions of dollars in capital expenditure to come up with the latest innovations and vanguard AI models - and whether export controls can hold off Chinese competition.Liang has been compared to OpenAI founder Sam Altman, but the Chinese citizen keeps a much lower profile and seldom speaks publicly. ""OpenAI is not a god and cannot always be at the forefront,"" Liang told Chinese media outlet 36Kr in July 2024.The previous year, Liang said more investment doesn't necessarily lead to more innovation. He has also opined on how Chinese companies have long been mostly followers as opposed to technology innovators. The problem has been a ""lack of confidence and not knowing how to organize high-density talents to achieve effective innovation,"" he was quoted as saying.Liang was born in 1985 in Zhanjiang, an economically poor city in China's southern Guangdong province. His father was an elementary school teacher. He studied electronic engineering at Zhejiang University, a prestigious college in the city of Hangzhou, and also earned a master's degree in information and communication engineering there.DeepSeek's research was funded by High-Flyer's R&D budget, Liang said previously. It drew computing resources from the quant fund, which had amassed 10,000 Nvidia GPUs in 2021, prior to US bans on exports of sophisticated Nvidia chips and GPUs.Liang recruited engineering talent almost exclusively from China. Many were fresh out of top universities, interns in their final leg of doctoral studies and Olympiad medal holders. bloomberg","Liang Wenfeng's quantitative hedge fund firm apologised profusely to investors for losing money during a tumultuous period for China's stock market.

Coca-Cola recalls batches of drinks in Europe after failed chlorate-level test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/coca-cola-recalls-batches-of-drinks-in-europe-after-failed-chlorate-level-test/articleshow/117635948.cms,".

Coca-Cola has recalled certain batches of its soft drinks across Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands after routine safety checks at its Ghent production plant revealed higher-than-normal levels of chlorate. The affected products include Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite, Minute Maid, and Fuze Tea, with production codes ranging from 328 GE to 338 GE.Chlorate, a byproduct of chlorine disinfectants used in water treatment, can potentially disrupt thyroid function, especially in children. The European Union's rapid alert system notified health authorities in Denmark, Portugal, and Romania to investigate whether contaminated drinks had reached store shelves or vending machines in those countries. The risk was categorised as ""serious.""Coca-Cola has assured consumers that the issue was traced to a single container used in the water treatment process at its Ghent facility. The company has urged customers not to consume drinks from the affected batches and to return them for refunds. ""We apologise to consumers and our commercial partners,"" Coca-Cola said in a statement.While the recall raised concerns, experts have reassured the public. Philippe Jorens, a professor at Antwerp University Hospital, told Belgian public broadcaster VTM that consuming harmful levels of chlorate from the affected drinks would require ingesting significant quantities.In addition, a small number of potentially contaminated drinks were shipped to France, Germany, and Great Britain, but no recalls were issued in those countries. “We are also in contact with authorities in a very small number of European markets – France, Germany, and Great Britain – where a very limited quantity of stock was also shipped,” the company said.","Routine safety checks at its Ghent production plant revealed higher-than-normal levels of chlorate.

The $1 trillion shock: How China's DeepSeek shook the foundations of US tech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/the-1-trillion-shock-how-chinas-deepseek-shook-the-foundations-of-us-tech/articleshow/117629763.cms,"Despite DeepSeek’s claims, doubts remain about its access to advanced chips.

Poll Is DeepSeek's AI Technology Superior to Other Available AI Tools? No, It Still Has a Long Way to Go Yes, It’s a Game Changer

The trigger?

Why it matters

DeepSeek’s announcement is more than a technological milestone—it’s a direct challenge to Silicon Valley’s dominance in AI. For years, US companies like OpenAI and Google have relied on their ability to spend billions on AI infrastructure and development, creating an almost unassailable competitive moat. Nvidia’s dominance in AI chips has fueled a skyrocketing valuation, with its GPUs seen as indispensable for training large language models (LLMs).

But DeepSeek’s revelation threatens to undercut this economic model. By demonstrating that high-performing AI models can be developed cheaply using fewer resources, the company has thrown into question the sustainability of these enormous capital expenditures. If the cost of training AI drops significantly, demand for high-end GPUs, advanced data centers, and specialized cloud services could fall, upending the financial prospects of US tech titans.

A $1 trillion fallout

The rise of DeepSeek

Are the DeepSeek fears real?

DeepSeek’s “Sputnik moment”

The scale and efficiency of DeepSeek’s breakthrough have led to comparisons with the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik in 1957—a moment that catalyzed the space race. Silicon Valley heavyweight Marc Andreessen called the R1 model “AI’s Sputnik moment” and “one of the most amazing breakthroughs” in the field. Even President Donald Trump weighed in, describing the development as a “wake-up call” for US industries. “Instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same solution,” he said.

In China, DeepSeek’s success was hailed as a national triumph. Zhou Hongyi , the CEO of Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, declared that the company had “upended the world.” Others called it proof that China was closing the gap with the U.S. in AI technology. The breakthrough has renewed confidence in Beijing’s ability to outmaneuver U.S. sanctions and technological barriers.

Skepticism and controversy

Impact on Silicon Valley’s AI giants

Nvidia Stock Beaten Down Due to DeepSeek

The new economics of AI

Geopolitical implications

A turning point for markets

For over two years, artificial intelligence (AI) has driven one of the most dramatic stock market rallies in history. Nvidia, the chipmaking giant and cornerstone of the AI revolution, became synonymous with the soaring optimism surrounding AI’s potential to reshape industries. Yet, on Monday, this euphoria came to a screeching halt. Nvidia suffered a historic $589 billion loss in market value—the largest one-day drop for a company in Wall Street history—sparking widespread panic in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and wiping nearly $1 trillion from global markets.A Chinese startup called DeepSeek , which last week announced a breakthrough in AI technology that threatens to upend the economics of the industry. The Hangzhou-based company introduced its R1 AI model, claiming it could rival the most advanced models from Silicon Valley titans like OpenAI and Google—for a fraction of the cost. The disruptive potential of DeepSeek’s innovation rattled investor confidence, sending ripples through the global tech ecosystem.Monday’s selloff was nothing short of catastrophic. Nvidia’s stock plummeted 17%, marking its lowest point since October and shaving billions off the fortunes of its investors. CEO Jensen Huang alone lost $21 billion from his net worth. Broadcom, another major player in AI chips, saw its shares fall 17.4%, while Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta faced declines ranging from 2% to 4%. Even power utility firms like Vistra and Constellation Energy, which are critical to the data center infrastructure powering AI, saw their stocks fall by 28.3% and 20.8%, respectively.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3%, dragging down the broader S&P 500 tech sector, which fell 5.6%. This was the sector’s worst one-day decline in over four years. By the end of the day, the global market had shed a staggering $1 trillion in value, a sharp reversal of the AI-driven gains that had propelled stocks to record highs over the past two years.DeepSeek, once an obscure startup, emerged as a serious player in the global AI race last week when it announced the release of its R1 model. According to the company, the R1 model can match the performance of OpenAI’s GPT-4 and other leading models while costing just $5.6 million to develop—a fraction of the hundreds of millions or even billions spent by U.S. firms. The company also claimed to have achieved this feat using Nvidia’s less powerful H800 chips, a move born of necessity due to U.S. export restrictions on more advanced GPUs like the H100.The timing of DeepSeek’s announcement could not have been more significant. Its AI chatbot, integrated with the R1 model, quickly became the most downloaded app on Apple’s US App Store, overtaking OpenAI’s ChatGPT. For Silicon Valley, the implications were clear: China had found a way to compete in the high-stakes AI game without the massive capital investments and infrastructure traditionally required.Despite the dramatic market response, not everyone is convinced of DeepSeek’s claims. Analysts like Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein and Atif Malik of Citigroup have questioned whether the R1 model can truly rival US counterparts at such a low cost. They pointed out that while DeepSeek may have used less advanced hardware, its ability to achieve cutting-edge performance without significant investments in GPUs remains debatable.There are also suspicions about how DeepSeek obtained its hardware. Elon Musk, who has heavily invested in Nvidia chips for his company xAI, speculated that DeepSeek may have acquired banned H100 chips through indirect channels. Alexandr Wang, CEO of Scale AI, echoed this sentiment, claiming that Chinese firms “have more H100s than people think.” Nvidia, however, stated that DeepSeek’s technology was “fully export control compliant.”The broader implications of DeepSeek’s rise are significant for U.S. tech companies. For years, firms like Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI have built their dominance on the premise that AI requires immense capital expenditure. Nvidia, for instance, has sold billions of dollars’ worth of high-end GPUs, becoming a linchpin of the AI revolution. But if DeepSeek’s claims hold, the demand for such hardware could decline, undermining the economic model that has driven the industry’s explosive growth.Nevertheless, some industry leaders see opportunity in DeepSeek’s innovation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the R1 model “an impressive competitor” and pledged to accelerate his company’s product releases. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella argued that cheaper AI would democratize access and drive broader adoption, potentially benefiting the global economy.DeepSeek’s announcement has forced a reevaluation of the economics of AI. For years, the development of large language models (LLMs) has been characterized by ballooning costs and resource-intensive processes. OpenAI’s GPT-4 reportedly cost over $100 million to train, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei suggested that some models are approaching $1 billion in development costs.In contrast, DeepSeek has demonstrated that advanced AI can be developed at a fraction of the cost, potentially reshaping how companies approach AI investments. This shift could benefit smaller players and startups, but it also raises questions about the billions already spent by Silicon Valley giants on data centers and infrastructure.DeepSeek’s success has broader geopolitical ramifications. The US has sought to curb China’s AI development through export controls and sanctions, limiting access to cutting-edge chips and technology. However, DeepSeek’s achievements suggest that these measures have not only failed but may have spurred innovation. By focusing on efficiency and resourcefulness, Chinese firms like DeepSeek are proving that they can compete with—and possibly surpass—their US counterparts.President Trump’s administration may now face pressure to tighten export restrictions further, a move that could escalate tensions with Beijing. At the same time, policymakers will need to consider how to foster innovation at home while maintaining a competitive edge.For investors, Monday’s selloff serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with overexposure to a single narrative. The AI boom, while transformative, has also fueled speculative behavior, with tech stocks reaching valuations that some argue are unsustainable. Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro, urged caution, noting that “panicking rarely makes for a good investment decision.”Yet, others see a silver lining. Lower costs could make AI more accessible, driving widespread adoption across industries and fueling long-term economic growth. As Joseph Amato of Neuberger Berman put it, “If you can invest less for a powerful model that has wider adoption, that’s got to be a good thing for the broad-based economy.”(With inputs from agencies)","A Chinese startup called DeepSeek announced a breakthrough in AI technology that threatens to upend the economics of the industry.

DeepSeek pips ChatGPT to become No. 1 productivity app on App Store,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/deepseek-pips-chatgpt-to-become-no-1-productivity-app-on-app-store/articleshow/117621312.cms,"BENGALURU: DeepSeek ’s dramatic impact on tech stocks worldwide on Monday was likely also the result of the huge interest it has generated among consumers. The Chinese artificial intelligence app has soared to the No. 1 spot in Apple's App Store productivity category across major markets including the US, UK, China and India, overtaking ChatGPT and other rivals in the generative AI space.In Google Play in India, DeepSeek was only at No. 26 and ChatGPT at No. 4 in the productivity category, but this could change in the coming days with the attention it is receiving.Among DeepSeek’s rivals building large language models (LLMs), Perplexity founder & CEO Aravind Srinivas was the only one to make a public comment on the Chinese company’s accomplishment. He congratulated DeepSeek, and noted on X: “For a while, it wasn't clear who would beat ChatGPT for the first time. The best we (Perplexity) could manage was #8, a year ago. Look forward to using all their (DeepSeek’s) models for search, assistant, and agents this year.”Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made an indirect reference to it. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, he said, ""We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.""DeepSeek is founded by Liang Wenfeng, who previously founded a hedge fund. What makes its achievement noteworthy has been its ability to make a ChatGPT-class language model at a fraction of ChatGPT’s cost. DeepSeek’s R1 AI model is said to match or even beat the likes of ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini on multiple parameters. What’s more, it’s free, unlike ChatGPT that has a very limited free version.Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the marquee venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and an advisor to US President Donald Trump, described DeepSeek’s accomplishment as “AI’s Sputnik moment,” making a reference to a period of anxiety among Western nations about a possible technological gap between the US and the Soviet Union when the latter launched the Sputnik satellite. Social media platform X was abuzz with DeepSeek around this. While some took potshots at companies such as OpenAI, which was founded 10 years ago, raised about $17.9 billion in funding, and has an employee base of thousands, others cast doubts on DeepSeek’s claims of spending less than $6 million to build R1.US venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya said: “We need to get better at taking huge shots on goal and allocating capital to the best of these ideas. I worry that in this current melee, we’ve overspent billions on dumb features which these next-gen models will roll over in the next 12 months or earlier. Lots of capital losses are coming.” Garry Tan, CEO of famed Silicon Valley-based startup accelerator Y Combinator, said DeepSeek’s search feels more sticky even after a few queries “because seeing the reasoning, even how earnest it is about what it knows and what it might not know, increases user trust by quite a lot.”Vaibhav Domkundwar, founder & CEO of Better Capital, told TOI that R1 is significant because it changes the game entirely. “It is not about proving what its real cost is… we will know a lot more in the coming days, but it will disprove a lot of the narrative pushed by OpenAI and others,” he said.","DeepSeek has soared to the No. 1 spot in Apple's App Store productivity category across major markets including the US, UK, China and India.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

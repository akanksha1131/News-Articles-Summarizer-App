US tariffs impact on jobs: Nearly 3 lakh workers at risk in textiles and gems? Here’s what experts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-tariffs-impact-on-jobs-nearly-3-lakh-workers-at-risk-in-textiles-and-gems-heres-what-experts-say/articleshow/123347404.cms,"India-U.S. Trade Deal: U.S. Team Cancels August Visit As Tariff Dispute Deepens: Report

The steep tariffs imposed on Indian exports to the US have triggered sharp debate among staffing specialists, with some flagging the risk of immediate job losses and others suggesting that India’s domestic demand and trade diversification could soften the blow.“The recent imposition of additional US tariffs is expected to have a direct and substantial impact on India's employment landscape. This will especially impact those industries relying heavily on the US market for business continuity and growth,” Genius HRTech founder, chairman and managing director R P Yadav told PTI.Yadav identified textiles, auto components, agriculture, and gems and jewellery as the most vulnerable sectors, warning that micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) will absorb the heaviest shock. He estimated that 2,00,000 to 3,00,000 jobs are at immediate risk, with textiles alone—being labour-intensive—potentially losing as many as 1,00,000 positions if the tariff regime remains in force for over six months.He further cautioned that gems and jewellery hubs in Surat and SEEPZ, Mumbai, could also face widespread job losses due to shrinking demand and rising costs in the US market.However, not all experts foresee an employment crisis.TeamLease Services Senior Vice President Balasubramanian Anantha Narayanan argued that India’s reliance on domestic consumption makes its job market less vulnerable than China’s.“At this point in time, we aren't seeing any signs of a slowdown or loss of jobs. This also by extension means that our jobs are largely in service of domestic demand too, with the exception of some sectors like ITeS among others. Our exports to the USA are USD 87 billion, which is roughly about 2.2 per cent of our overall GDP. Largely pharma, electronics etc. won't be affected for now, which will further limit the export exposure to industries such as textiles, gems and jewellery among others,” he said, quoted PTI.He also noted that the tariffs are yet to take effect, leaving space for possible negotiations. “On the other side, we've also had several positives by way of the recently closed FTA with the UK and other countries. Even if these US tariffs do come about, we'll definitely figure out a way of redirecting or diversifying our trade to other markets. Therefore, at this point in time, we aren't seeing any signs of a slowdown or loss of jobs. It's an evolving situation and we'll get to know more in due course of time,” Narayanan said.According to him, the broader drag on employment stems from global consumption slowdown, tariff uncertainties, and ongoing geopolitical conflicts.CIEL HR MD and CEO Aditya Mishra said the tariff scenario is unsettling exporters in sectors deeply tied to the American market—including electronics, textiles, gems and jewellery, auto components, leather, footwear, shrimp and engineering goods.“Even industries outside the direct tariff ambit, like pharmaceuticals, are feeling the ripple effect through costlier upstream chemicals and materials,” Mishra said. He added that uncertainty could persist through the third quarter of this financial year as negotiations unfold.While Mishra does not expect widespread layoffs, he noted that companies are already adopting cost-control measures—cutting discretionary spends, streamlining production, freezing hiring, and putting pressure on temporary and contractual roles. “The immediate pressure will be on temporary and contract roles, particularly shop-floor workers, artisans, sales and logistics staff, and some mid-level managers in export-led units. This will have a cascading effect on thousands of MSMEs in the supply chain, which collectively account for a large share of employment,” he warned.Mishra also pointed to potential spillover risks for IT and global capability centres (GCCs). “The IT sector is already experiencing slow spending and hiring, and this additional uncertainty could delay its recovery further. GCCs are likely to take a cautious approach to hiring and investments until there is greater clarity on trade negotiations and market stability. If the tariff situation persists, India's market share in the US could shrink, leading to longer-term repercussions for exporters and the industries that depend on them,” he said.","The steep tariffs imposed on Indian exports to the US have triggered sharp debate among staffing specialists.

GST 2.0 tussle: Centre eyes extra duty over 40% slab on tobacco products; states push for 'significant' cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-2-0-tussle-centre-eyes-extra-duty-over-40-slab-on-tobacco-products-states-push-for-significant-cut/articleshow/123354291.cms,"Govt mulling extra GST over and above 40% proposed on tobacco products (AI image)

GST Reforms To Jobs: PM Modi's Eight Big Announcements For India During 79th Independence Day Speech

Revenue considerations

The government is reportedly considering imposing additional excise or special duties beyond the proposed 40% GST on tobacco products to sustain current taxation levels, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement of GST 2.0 reforms that eliminate compensation cess.Several states are requesting a ""significant share"" in the supplementary taxation on tobacco items to offset immediate revenue reductions, according to Economic Times sources familiar with ongoing discussions regarding sin goods taxation, particularly tobacco.""During the discussion some states asked for equal share on the additional duty to be imposed,"" disclosed one source anonymously.The rate rationalisation ministerial group, led by Bihar's deputy chief minister Samrat Chaudhary, is likely to convene once more before the upcoming GST Council meeting to address this matter, with states anticipating next-generation GST reforms.The GST Council will take the ultimate decision on this issue.Presently, tobacco and related products, including cigarette, cigars, pan masala, cigarillos and hookah, face 28% GST plus compensation cess, central excise duty and national calamity contingent duty, totalling 53% indirect tax.The past five years saw average yearly GST collections of Rs 51,000 crore from tobacco products, with additional education cess and surcharges from manufacturers reaching Rs 27,659.84 crore.Finance officials, on Independence Day, proposed restructuring GST into two tiers, eliminating 12% and 28% slabs, while introducing a 40% category for select sin goods including tobacco products.The proposal maintains that overall tobacco product taxation would remain unchanged. Without compensation cess, this requires implementation of alternative additional duties.Also read: PM Modi seeks states’ backing on draft GST reform proposal, promises double Diwali bonus for people Various states seek either equal shares in additional duties or independent taxation rights, similar to alcohol's state excise duty system. They contend that existing indirect tax on tobacco products can exceed 53% without affecting revenue for central or state governments.""A few states suggested that either it should be a basic excise duty, divisible between the Centre and states, or a central excise duty along with state excise duty - which would be a win-win for both, giving headroom to states to generate their revenue,"" revealed a source involved in discussions.Kerala has formally requested compensation for revenue losses from GST reforms.""The so-called simplification of GST rates announced by Modi will be devastating for state revenues,"" Kerala finance minister Thomas Issac said in a post on X. ""The GST rates that have already been rendered below revenue neutral rate by 2018 pre-election simplification, will now shrink further. States must be compensated for the loss.""India's tobacco products remain globally amongst the most affordable, according to parliamentary standing committee's 139th report. The report indicated substantial scope for increased taxation, recommending 40% peak rate and significant excise duty increases.","Several states are requesting a ""significant share"" in the supplementary taxation on tobacco items.

Air Canada strike: Restart plan suspended as union defies return-to-work order; prolonged standoff deepens travel chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/air-canada-strike-government-ends-flight-attendants-walkout-services-to-resume-but-cancellations-linger/articleshow/123345627.cms,"Air Canada suspended its planned restart of operations on Sunday after flight attendants refused to comply with a government back-to-work order that they called “unconstitutional. ” The order had required them to return to duty by 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), but the union vowed to continue its strike, prolonging widespread cancellations and travel disruptions.Earlier today, Air Canada announced that it will restart flights on Sunday evening after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants that left more than 100,000 travellers stranded during the peak summer season.The airline, Canada’s largest, said it will take several days before operations return to normal and warned that some flights would remain cancelled over the next seven to 10 days until schedules stabilise.Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered attendants back to work less than 12 hours after they walked off the job at 1 a.m. on Saturday, citing the broader economic impact, AP reported.“Now is not the time to take risks with the economy,” Hajdu said, pointing to the unprecedented tariffs the US has imposed on Canada.The dispute has been referred to the Canada Industrial Relations Board, which extended the current collective agreement until a new one is decided by arbitration.The walkout had paralysed operations of the carrier, which runs nearly 700 flights daily. The shutdown was affecting about 130,000 passengers a day. Aviation analytics firm Cirium said Air Canada had cancelled 671 flights by Saturday afternoon, following 199 cancellations on Friday. Another 96 flights scheduled for Sunday were already suspended.The union had rejected Air Canada’s earlier request for government-directed arbitration, escalating the conflict. The government previously forced two major railroads into arbitration during a strike last year, a move unions challenged in court, arguing it weakened labour’s bargaining power. In this case, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce welcomed Ottawa’s intervention, and the Business Council of Canada had also urged binding arbitration.Hajdu stressed that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government is “not anti-union,” but added it was clear both sides were at an impasse.Air Canada announced that passengers affected by cancellations would be eligible for full refunds through its website or mobile app. It also promised to arrange alternative travel with other Canadian and foreign airlines “where possible,” but cautioned that immediate rebooking could not be guaranteed as flights on other carriers were already full during the busy summer season.The airline and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) have been negotiating for nearly eight months without success. Pay remains the most contentious issue. Air Canada said its latest proposal offered a 38% increase in overall compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, a package that “would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.”The union disagreed, arguing that the proposed 8% raise in the first year fell short of addressing inflation and raised concerns about the unpaid work flight attendants perform when aircraft are not in the air.","Air Canada flight attendants refused to comply with a government back-to-work order that they called “unconstitutional” The order had required them to return to duty by 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), but the union vowed to continue its strike, prolonging widespread cancellations and travel disruptions.

Sebi plans easier IPO norms for big firms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/sebi-plans-easier-ipo-norms-for-big-firms/articleshow/123375206.cms,".

MUMBAI : The markets regulator is seeking to make it easier for India’s largest firms to go public. Sebi has proposed easing minimum public offer (MPO) norms and extending timelines for meeting minimum public shareholding (MPS) requirements. The proposals have been submitted to the govt for amending the Securities Contracts (Regulations) Rules.Currently, firms with a post-issue market value above Rs 1 lakh crore must sell at least 10% of equity. Sebi wants to replace this single threshold with a three-tier system. Companies valued between Rs 50,000 crore and Rs 1 lakh crore would need to float at least 8% of shares, with a floor of Rs 1,000 crore. Those between Rs 1 lakh crore and Rs 5 lakh crore would dilute 2.75%, or at least Rs 6,250 crore. For the very largest, worth over Rs 5 lakh crore, the minimum would drop to 2.5%, or Rs 15,000 crore.The regulator also wants to provide more time to reach the 25% MPS threshold. Firms in the Rs 50,000–1,00,000 crore range would get five years instead of three.Those above Rs 1 lakh crore would have tiered timelines: up to ten years if they list with less than 15% public shareholding, and five years if they start above that level.Sebi has suggested that the extended timelines should also apply to listed firms yet to achieve 25% public shareholding, whether still within their permitted period or already non-compliant.Sebi’s rationale is that large flotations are difficult to absorb in one go. Forcing companies to sell too much too quickly risks depressing valuations. The regulator noted that IPO sizes are rising but that recent mega-listings, including Life Insurance Corporation of India and Hyundai Motor India, show that smaller floats still provide adequate liquidity.Both issuers have shareholder bases and trading turnover similar to Nifty 100 firms.In a shift from earlier proposals, Sebi has decided to retain the 35% retail quota for all IPOs, including jumbo issues. It argued that lowering the MPO requirements would make large public issues more manageable, removing the need to reduce the retail share portion.","Currently, firms with a post-issue market value above Rs 1 lakh crore must sell at least 10% of equity.

E-com majors ramp up hiring for fest season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/e-com-majors-ramp-up-hiring-for-fest-season/articleshow/123375176.cms,".

BENGALURU: E-commerce majors Amazon India and Flipkart are expanding their workforce by about 1.5 lakh temporary staff each to handle the surge in orders expected during the upcoming festive season, people aware of the matter said.Amazon on Monday announced that it has created more than 1.5 lakh seasonal job opportunities across its fulfilment centres, sortation hubs and last-mile delivery network. The company said the hires include thousands of women and more than 2,000 persons with disabilities, and that most of them have already joined operations. The additional staff will support its 16 lakh sellers during the peak shopping period.A source familiar with Flipkart’s plans told TOI that its seasonal workforce is expected to touch about 1.5 lakh, taking the company’s overall supply chain strength to around 3 lakh during the festival period. “This time, given the GST reforms, expectations point to a bumper festival… In many ways it makes sense to hire for festive expectations. Having these is a competitive advantage in many ways,” the person said. Flipkart did not respond to TOI’s queries at the time of publication.During 2024's festival sales, the two e-commerce majors had hired 1-1.5 lakh temporary staffers. Both firms compete for a larger share of consumer spending in what is expected to be a bumper season, helped by an anticipated uptick in discretionary purchases.","Amazon announced that it has created more than 1.5 lakh seasonal job opportunities across its fulfilment centres, sortation hubs and last-mile delivery network.

MUMBAI: Reliance Consumer Products (RCPL) bought a majority stake in a joint venture with Naturedge Beverages, marking its foray into the healthy functional beverages space. Naturedge Beverages is from the house of the 108year-old Baidyanath Group, which has a legacy of making Ayurvedic products.The acquisition comes at a time when there is a shift among consumers towards healthier choices, a trend which picked up post-Covid. Besides giving RCPL a leg up in the nascent functional beverages segment, it will also broaden the company’s overall beverages portfolio.Naturedge, founded in 2018 by Siddhesh Sharma, a thirdgeneration entrepreneur from Baidyanath Group, is the maker of Shunya—a herb-infused functional packaged beverage with zero sugar and zero calories. Shunya will now come under RCPL’s fold as it steps up competition against beverage majors such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo by betting on newer categories that may have the potential to grow bigger going ahead amid evolving consumption patterns.","Naturedge Beverages is from the house of the 108year-old Baidyanath Group.

Exporters to seek support of government for workers losing jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/exporters-to-seek-support-of-government-for-workers-losing-jobs/articleshow/123375126.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Amid expectations of job losses due to higher tariffs, exporters are seeking support for workers who would be hit by the impact of US President Donald Trump ’s actions.At a meeting of export promotion councils convened by the federation of indian export organisations on Monday, most businesses suggested that a package from the Centre should be sought for workers.One of the suggestions was to seek a Covid-type package, which covered their social security benefit and provided some other assistance to reduce the burden on employers.A second proposal is to use the opportunity to upskill workers, for which a monthly govt support of Rs 15,000 is likely to be sought.While exporters are working with clients to see how they can navigate through the crisis, the dominant view in the community is that orders from American buyers will stop if Trump goes ahead with his plan to impose another 25% additional tariff on Indian exports to the US, taking the total levies to 50%. There have been suggestions that govt should cover part of the additional tariff burden, but even exporters realise that it is tough to implement.Besides, government is unwilling to immediately act on the demands, arguing that it would rather wait for the tariffs to be imposed as several developments are taking place around the globe, including talks between Russia and the US over finding a solution to the Ukraine conflict.In addition, it was pointed to exporters that shipments to the US have grown by 21% during April-July, as reported by TOI on Monday, while overall goods export growth is to the tune of 3%. This is largely due to frontloading of orders by Indian exporters, who are keen to avoid additional duties.",Businesses are working with clients to see how they can navigate through the crisis.

Stimulus For Spending

TOI

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Aiming to set off a “cracker of a Diwali”, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi put it, the proposed rationalisation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates could provide a lift to the struggling packaged foods sector by boosting consumption and reviving urban demand. Diwali, traditionally the peak season for household and discretionary spending in India, could see a sharper rebound with potential reforms and lower prices.Under GST reforms, govt plans to scrap existing GST slabs of 12% and 28%, and keep only two rates, 5% and 18%, excluding sin goods. A majority of the goods in the 12% category are expected to move to 5%, while items in the 28% bracket may be taxed at 18%, experts say.The proposed GST rate cuts on consumer goods are expected to provide a stimulus to spending, which has remained sluggish over the past several quarters. A long spell of tepid urban demand coupled with unseasonal showers and early monsoons — which washed out summer sales of consumer goods — weighed on consumption, which is yet to see a broad-based recovery. Recent data by NielsenIQ showed that urban regions lagged behind rural for the straight sixth quarter.With consumption accounting for about 60% of GDP and serving as the mainstay of India’s domestic demand, the impact of GST cuts could be significant. Any benefit from GST reduction will have to be passed on to consumers, translating into lower retail prices, experts pointed out. “As the festive season approaches, this move will help improve sentiments and put more purchasing power directly into the hands of millions of Indian families. This is more than just a policy shift, it’s a signal of confidence in India’s consumption story. It will energise demand, ease the burden on households and catalyse growth for branded FMCG products,’’ Dabur India CEO Mohit Malhotra toldReforms build on recent pro-growth measures, including income tax cuts for the middle-income group, cut in interest rates, revival in govt capex and others could help cushion the economy against uncertainties stemming from external factors, such as US tariff pressures, analysts from I-Sec say.“In food space, many products are currently taxed at 12% and 18%. If a large share of food products is moved to the 5% category, it will bring price reduction and give a huge boost to consumption,” said Mayank Shah, vice-president at Parle Products, maker of Monaco and Hide & Seek biscuits. Dalal Street cheered the move with consumer stocks ending in the green on the exchanges on Monday.Staples are expected to attract a lower levy, while discretionary products a higher rate of 18%.Further, companies including Hindustan Unilever and Britannia could benefit as several raw materials shift to lower slabs, reducing input costs and supporting consumption of core staples, analyst from Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a note.Rationalisation of GST slabs has the potential to unlock demand across consumer segments. “In urban centres, we could see consumers upgrading more easily to premium formats..in rural areas, companies would look to pass more value to their customers through lower price points or higher volume for the relevant categories,” said Krishna Khatwani, head of sales (India) at Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL).Packaged foods, ayurvedic and OTC products, fruit juices, and discretionary items like apparel and footwear could benefit as a result of the tweak in GST.The new GST structure is expected to not only enhance urban and rural spending but also facilitate an improved ease of doing business in current challenging economic environment, said Manish Anandani, Managing Director, at Kenvue.The move will also ease adoption concerns for the emerging wellness category, while also supporting wider acceptance, added Shivam Puri, MD & CEO at Cipla Health.","Proposed rationalisation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates could boost consumption.

To Wipe Out Negative Sentiment

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Expect a bumper Diwali for consumers as plans to rationalise and reduce GST rates on ACs, televisions (above 32-inch) and dishwashers will see retail prices come down by as much as 7-8%, leading to price cuts from a few thousand rupees to over Rs 10,000 on premium products.The industry said the decision, particularly around Diwali, will result in mega festive sales, something which will also help shrug off any negative sentiments flowing in due to geopolitical concerns, IT slowdown, or US tariffs.The GST cut will easily be one of the steepest consumer price cuts in a segment that has been stagnating for years, especially as incomes of buyers in the entry categories never matched price increments.“It will be a super Diwali this time around. Expect price cuts of up to 8% across categories,” Manish Sharma, chairman of Panasonic Life Solutions India and South Asia, told. He said that most of the pre-festive sales are likely to shift towards Diwali as consumers will purchase as and when the cuts happen.Currently, the categories of ACs, larger TVs and dishwashers are taxed at 28%, which is now likely to go down to 18% GST rate.Sunil Vachani, chairman of Dixon Technologies, which is the country’s biggest contract manufacturer, said that the measure will help generate demand and will specially encourage the transition to bigger TVs and other premium products.“The industry expects that demand for TVs with sizes upwards of 40 inches will go up significantly, which will lead to premiumisation of the category. Also, categories such as ACs and dishwashers still have lower penetration and should get a boost by price cuts as GST rates come down,” Vachani said.Sources said that companies such as Samsung, LG, and Sony have started to ramp up production, specially of premium variants, in view of the expected cut in GST rates.“With rising temperatures, cooling appliances like ACs are no longer a luxury and have become a necessity. However, the AC penetration levels in India is still low at 910%.GST reduction on ACs can help make it more affordable for the masses and improve the quality of life for many Indians,” said Kamal Nandi, business head (appliances business) at Godrej Enterprises Group.","The industry said the decision, particularly around Diwali, will result in mega festive sales.

In which direction is Hurricane Erin headed?







Hurricane Erin strengthened into a category 5 hurricane, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Saturday.Erin is about 160 miles (255 kilometers) north of Anguilla, as the NHC warned of possible flooding and landslides.Tropical storm watches have been issued for Anguilla, Barbuda, St. Martin, St. Barts, Saba, St. Eustatius and St. Maarten while heavy rains are expected in Antigua and Barbuda, the US and British Virgin Islands and southern and eastern Puerto Rico. Up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain is anticipated, with isolated totals of up to 6 inches (15 centimeters), according to the NHC.The NHC said Eric could create powerful rip currents off parts of the US East Coast later in the week, even if its eye forecast remains far offshore.Hurricane expert Michael Lowry said Erin is forecast to eventually take a sharp turn northeast that would put it on a route between the US and Bermuda.""All of our best consensus aids show Erin turning safely east of the United States next week, but it'll be a much closer call for Bermuda, which could land on the stronger eastern side of Erin,"" he said.Erin is the Atlantic season's first hurricane and is expected to become a major Category 3 storm late this weekend, passing around 200 miles north of Puerto Rico.","Erin is about 160 miles (255 kilometers) north of Anguilla, as the NHC warned of possible flooding and landslides.

AU$90 million penalty: Qantas Airways fined for illegal sackings during Covid pandemic; judge questions lack of remorse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/au90-million-penalty-qantas-airways-fined-for-illegal-sackings-during-covid-pandemic-judge-slams-lack-of-remorse/articleshow/123360283.cms,"Representative image

A judge in Australia fined Qantas Airways 90 million Australian dollars ($59 million) for unlawfully dismissing more than 1,800 ground staff during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. The penalty is in addition to the AU$120 million ($78 million) compensation the airline had already agreed to pay dismissed employees.Justice Michael Lee of the Australian Federal Court ruled that the dismissal of 1,820 baggage handlers and cleaners at airports in late 2020 was the most serious breach of Australian labour laws in their 120-year history, according to the Associated Press.After Qantas’s appeal was unanimously rejected by seven High Court judges last December, the airline confirmed its wrongdoing and agreed to pay AU$120 million in compensation. The Transport Workers Union (TWU), which initiated the case, had sought the maximum penalty of AU$121 million.Justice Lee determined that AU$90 million was the minimum deterrent, noting Qantas executives had expected annual savings of AU$125 million through outsourcing. He also questioned the airline’s remorse, highlighting its subsequent unsuccessful attempt to avoid paying compensation.""If any further evidence was needed of the unrelenting and aggressive litigation strategy adopted in this case by Qantas, it is provided by this effort directed to denying any compensation whatsoever to those in respect of whom Qantas was publicly professing regret for their misfortune,"" Lee said.""I do think that the people in charge of Qantas now have some genuine regret, but this more likely reflects the damage that this case has done to the company rather than remorse for the damage done to the affected workers,"" he added.Following the ruling, Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson, who was CFO at the time of the redundancies, issued an apology: ""We sincerely apologize to each and every one of the 1,820 ground handling employees and to their families who suffered as a result. The decision to outsource five years ago, particularly during such an uncertain time, caused genuine hardship for many of our former team and their families. Over the past 18 months we've worked hard to change the way we operate as part of our efforts to rebuild trust with our people and our customers. This remains our highest priority as we work to earn back the trust we lost.""Lee directed that AU$50 million of the fine be paid to the TWU, citing its role in exposing Qantas’s unlawful conduct when no government agency pursued the case. The allocation of the remaining AU$40 million will be decided in a future hearing.TWU national secretary Michael Kaine hailed the judgment, describing it as a landmark victory after a five-year legal battle. ""It is a significant — the most significant — industrial outcome in Australia's history and it sends a really clear message to Qantas and to every employer in Australia: Treat your work force illegally and you will be held accountable,"" Kaine said.""Against all the odds, we took on a behemoth that had shown itself to be ruthless and we won,"" he added.Qantas has also faced legal action over its treatment of passengers during the pandemic. The airline previously agreed to pay AU$120 million in compensation and fines after the competition watchdog accused it of misleading customers by selling tickets for more than 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled between May 2021 and July 2022.","A judge in Australia fined Qantas 90 million Australian dollars ($59 million) for unlawfully dismissing more than 1,800 ground staff.

Rubio sets the record straight on where Trump stands with Putin's demands

US State Secretary Marco Rubio cautioned on Monday about potential energy price increases if the United States enforces secondary sanctions on China for processing Russian oil.The US secretary was asked, ""is Europe still buying Russian oil?""""Well, if you look at the oil that’s going to China and being refined, a lot of that is then being sold back into Europe. Europe’s also buying natural gas still. Now, there are countries trying to wean themselves off it, but there’s more Europe can do with regard to their own sanctions,"" Rubio responded during an interview with Fox Business on Sunday.The statement comes amid objections over the US's selective approach- imposing a 25% additional tariff on India (taking total to 50%) for Russian oil purchases while taking no comparable measures against China.Rubio was further asked about sanctions on Europe for continuing to purchase Russia oil. ""Wouldn't that be a major lever to pull to put sanctions on Europe or or punish Europe for continuing to buy oil and gas from Russia? Is that something on the table?"" asked Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures' anchor Maria Bartiromo.In response Rubio added, ""Well, I don't know about on Europe directly obviously, but certainly there are implications to secondary sanctions.If you put secondary sanctions on a country – let's say you were to go after the oil sales of Russian oil to China. Well, China just refines that oil. That oil is then sold into the global marketplace, and anyone who's buying that oil would be paying more for it or, if it doesn't exist, would have to find an alternative source for it,"" Rubio said further during the interview.""So we have heard, when you talk about the Senate bill that was being proposed where there was a hundred percent tariffs on China and India, we did hear from a number of European countries – not in press releases but we heard from them – some concern about what that could mean. But look, I don't want to get into a tit for tat with Europeans on this."" he further added.Currently, China leads Russian oil purchases at approximately 2 million barrels daily, with India and Turkey following.The sanctions discussion has resurfaced following Trump's notable meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15. Despite the summit failing to achieve a Ukraine ceasefire agreement, Trump described the talks as productive, giving them a ""10 out of 10.""Previously, the US president had suggested that India-targeted tariffs for Russian oil purchases influenced Moscow's decision to seek dialogue with Washington, citing Russia's loss of its ""second largest customer"".In his Fox News interview on Thursday, Trump had said, ""I think everything has an impact,"" adding that when he informed India ""we're going to charge you, because you're dealing with Russia and oil purchases"", it ""essentially took them out of buying oil from Russia"".However, India recently confirmed its continuation of Russian oil purchases despite US presidential tariff threats, maintaining its focus on economic factors.",US State Secretary Marco Rubio cautioned on Monday about potential energy price increases if the United States enforces secondary sanctions on China for processing Russian oil.

Contract talks break down

Travellers left in limbo

Air Canada has suspended all operations after more than 10,000 of its flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday, plunging peak summer travel into chaos and leaving passengers stranded around the world.The strike began shortly before 1 am EDT after a deadline to reach a new contract passed, Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) spokesman Hugh Pouliot confirmed, as per news agency AP.The airline announced soon after that it would halt flights entirely, strongly advising customers “not to go to the airport” and expressing “deep regret” over the disruption, reported news agency AFP.The complete shutdown is affecting Air Canada’s full schedule of about 700 daily flights, impacting roughly 130,000 travellers per day, including an estimated 25,000 Canadians abroad.By Friday night, the airline had already cancelled 623 flights affecting more than 100,000 passengers, according to AFP.Negotiations between Air Canada and CUPE have been ongoing for about eight months but remain deadlocked over pay and compensation for unpaid ground duties. The union has refused to enter government-directed arbitration, which would have removed its right to strike, saying it wants to bargain directly.“We’re here to bargain a deal, not to go on strike,” Pouliot said in an email cited by AP, adding that Air Canada had not countered the union’s last two proposals since Tuesday.Air Canada’s latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation over four years, which it said would make its flight attendants the best paid in Canada.A Thursday statement from the airline detailed that, under the proposal, a senior flight attendant would earn about C$87,000 by 2027.The union has rejected the offer, calling it “below inflation and below market value”. CUPE is also seeking pay for ground duties such as boarding, which are currently uncompensated, a standard practice in the airline industry but one the union says is unfair.Rafael Gomez, director of the University of Toronto’s Centre for Industrial Relations, was quoted by AFP as saying that while unpaid pre-flight work is common globally, CUPE has successfully framed it as an issue of fairness in the public eye. “That’s a very good issue to highlight,” he said, noting that any gains here could influence other carriers.With planes grounded, travellers have been left scrambling. Montreal resident Alex Laroche, 21, said he and his girlfriend had saved since Christmas for an $8,000 European vacation — now at risk. “At this point, it’s just a waiting game,” Laroche said, as per AP.He initially resented the strike but changed his mind after learning about the wage dispute, saying, “Their wage is barely livable.”Air Canada says passengers can request full refunds via its website or app, and it will attempt to rebook travellers on other carriers where possible. However, the airline warns that alternative flights are already full due to summer demand.Canada’s federal jobs minister Patty Hajdu urged both sides to “work harder” to resolve the dispute, calling it “unacceptable that such little progress has been made”. The Business Council of Canada warned before the strike that halting Air Canada’s passenger and cargo services could cause “immediate and extensive harm” to the economy.Industry experts expect the stoppage to be short-lived. “This is peak season,” Gomez said. “The airline does not want to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue… They’re almost playing chicken with the flight attendants”.","Air Canada has suspended all operations after more than 10,000 flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday.

Affordability vs returns

When Oakland resident Terrence Dwyer got a flyer advertising a solar system small enough to fit on his deck — and that plugs into a regular wall socket — he didn’t hesitate. “Absolutely, let’s do this right away,” he said.Such “plug-in” or “balcony” solar kits, long popular in Europe for their affordability and easy installation, are now gaining traction in the US, AP reported. The momentum is expected to build as President Donald Trump’s budget package ends residential rooftop solar tax credits, potentially shifting interest to cheaper, smaller alternatives.Dwyer’s $2,000 setup — two 400-watt panels, an inverter, smart meter and circuit breaker — saves him about $35 a month on power bills. “We like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,” he said. A comparable rooftop system would have cost him $20,000 plus $30,000 in roof upgrades.US adoption has been slower than Europe’s due to patchy utility rules, low awareness and limited availability. Some utilities require the same interconnection paperwork as rooftop systems, despite plug-in models being designed to prevent power flowing back into the grid.In March, Utah became the first state to pass a law exempting small plug-in systems from interconnection agreements while mandating safety certification. Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the bill, said: “Europe has these things. You can go buy them and they work… there is no reason why we shouldn’t have them here.”California-based nonprofit Bright Saver, which sold Dwyer his kit, also offers a $399 model that sold out in six days. “The interest and demand have been overwhelming,” said co-founder Cora Stryker. Bright Saver and others are lobbying more states for supportive legislation.Experts say savings vary widely. UC Berkeley’s Severin Borenstein estimates a $2,000 US kit costs roughly $0.20/kWh over 25 years — viable mainly in areas with high utility rates. In Europe, where kits cost around $600, the equivalent rate is $0.05–$0.06/kWh.Baltimore engineer Craig Keenan installed a $399 Bright Saver kit on his balcony in July. “I’m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions we produce is unsustainable,” he said. It will save him about $40 annually and took just 15 minutes to set up.Texas-based Craftstrom has sold about 2,000 kits since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. China’s EcoFlow plans to enter Utah before expanding to other states. “This is an example of technology being ahead of regulators,” said EcoFlow’s Ryan Oliver.Analysts expect demand to accelerate as rooftop solar credits expire. “Utilities prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer,” said UCLA’s Robert Cudd. “Plug-in solar changes that.”","'plug-in' or 'balcony' solar kits are now gaining traction in the US. momentum is expected to build as President Donald Trump’s budget package ends residential rooftop solar tax credits.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 141 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1%, according to AP.Investor optimism has grown on expectations of a September rate cut, which could boost asset prices and spur economic activity by lowering borrowing costs for US households and businesses. However, lower rates also risk fuelling inflation. A weaker-than-expected US wholesale inflation report on Thursday trimmed some of the rate-cut optimism, but traders still largely expect the Fed to act. Treasury yields have retreated sharply in recent days and were steady on Friday.Economic data released Friday painted a mixed picture: US retail sales rose as forecast in July, manufacturing in New York state unexpectedly expanded, but nationwide industrial production fell, missing expectations for modest growth.Later in the day, a consumer sentiment report on inflation and the economy was awaited.On Wall Street, UnitedHealth Group soared 10.3% after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed the purchase of nearly 5 million shares in the insurer during the spring, valued at $1.57 billion. Berkshire Hathaway shares gained 0.2%.Applied Materials fell 12.5% despite posting quarterly results above analyst forecasts, as its revenue guidance for the current quarter disappointed investors. CEO Gary Dickerson cited a “dynamic macroeconomic and policy environment” creating uncertainty, particularly for the company’s China business. Sandisk dropped 4.9% after its upbeat quarterly profit was overshadowed by a weaker-than-expected profit outlook.In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.7% on stronger-than-expected GDP growth, while Shanghai gained 0.8% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 1% after data showed China’s economy slowed across key indicators in July, prompting calls for more policy support.ING Economics noted, “Chinese economic activity slowed across the board in July, with retail sales, fixed asset investment, and value added of industry growth all reaching the lowest levels of the year. After a strong start, several months of cooling momentum suggest that the economy may need further policy support.”European markets traded mixed ahead of a scheduled meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which could influence the direction of the war in Ukraine.In bonds, the 10-year US Treasury yield held at 4.29%, while the two-year yield slipped to 3.72% from 3.74%.","The S&P 500 was virtually unchanged in early trade, a day after notching a fresh all-time high.

Shoppers in the US kept up a healthy pace of spending in July, particularly at auto dealerships, even as President Donald Trump's tariffs began taking a toll on jobs and pushed some prices higher.Retail sales rose 0.5% last month, slowing from a revised 0.9% in June, according to the Commerce Department’s report released Friday. The July pace matched economists’ estimates. June’s figure had been revised upward, AP reported.The gains came after two straight months of declines — a 0.1% dip in April and a 0.9% fall in May. Excluding auto sales, which have been volatile since Trump imposed tariffs on many foreign-made cars, sales rose 0.3%. Auto sales jumped 1.6%, returning to more normal spending levels after a March-April surge, when buyers rushed to beat Trump’s 25% duty on imported cars and parts, followed by a slump. Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the pattern reflected that early rush and subsequent slowdown.The report showed broad-based spending gains. Clothing store sales climbed 0.7%, online retailers gained 0.8%, and home furnishings and furniture stores rose 1.4%.Electronics store sales fell 0.6%, while restaurants — the lone services component in the Census Bureau report and a key discretionary spending gauge — slipped 0.4% as more shoppers opted to eat at home to cut costs.Spending resilience comes even as Trump’s tariffs slow hiring and raise prices. Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported US employers added just 73,000 jobs in July, far below the 115,000 expected, as trade policies rattled businesses and dented economic outlook.A separate government report Tuesday showed inflation was unchanged in July, with rising prices for some imports offset by cheaper gas and groceries. Consumer prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, matching June’s pace and up from a post-pandemic low of 2.3% in April. Core prices, excluding food and energy, rose 3.1%, up from 2.9% in June — both above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% in July, down from 0.3% in June, while core prices ticked up 0.3% from 0.2%. Slower rent increases and lower fuel prices appear to be offsetting some tariff effects. Many companies are still absorbing much of the added costs from Trump’s 10% universal tariff imposed in April and higher duties on countries including China and Canada.That could soon change. The Labor Department said Thursday its producer price index — measuring inflation before it reaches consumers — jumped 0.9% from June, the biggest monthly gain in over three years. Wholesale prices were up 3.3% from a year earlier, both figures exceeding forecasts.The data come as major retailers such as Walmart and Target prepare to release fiscal second-quarter earnings next week. Analysts will look for signs of how much of the tariff costs are being passed on to consumers and assess consumer sentiment ahead of the fall and winter shopping seasons.In May, Walmart warned that banana prices from Costa Rica had risen from 50 cents to 54 cents a pound and that more significant price impacts would emerge in June and July. Chief financial officer John David Rainey told The Associated Press he expected car seats from China priced at $350 could cost customers an extra $100.Several other companies, including Procter & Gamble, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Black & Decker, and Ralph Lauren, have told investors they have raised or plan to raise prices. Eyewear retailer Warby Parker is taking a selective approach, lifting prices only on premium products to offset tariff costs.Warby Parker has been reducing its reliance on China, targeting a year-end goal of keeping the share of goods sourced there under 15%. Still, the company faces higher tariffs from other countries.Executives said they plan to keep the $95 option but will increase prices for certain lens types, focusing more on older customers who need progressive lenses. Progressives, trifocals, and bifocals account for about 40% of prescription sales industrywide, but only 23% of Warby Parker’s business. These lenses are the company’s most expensive offerings and carry the highest margins.“We were able to quickly roll out select strategic price increases that have benefited our growth,” said Neil Blumenthal, co-chairman, co-founder, and co-CEO of Warby Parker.","Retail sales rose 0.5% last month, slowing from a revised 0.9% in June. Auto sales jumped 1.6%, returning to more normal spending levels after a March-April surge. Slower rent increases and lower fuel prices appear to be offsetting some tariff effects.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123323173,imgsize-1554937,width-400,resizemode-4/123323173.jpg"

Asian stock markets showed a mixed performance on Friday, with strong Japanese growth figures offset by weaker Chinese data, while oil prices slipped ahead of a high-stakes US-Russia summit on Ukraine.As per news agency AFP, Japan’s economy expanded by 0.3% in the April-June quarter, surpassing forecasts, while the previous quarter’s output was revised upwards, helping the world’s fourth-largest economy avoid a technical recession.The growth came despite tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Japanese imports, including cars, an industry that provides around 8% of Japan’s jobs. The Nikkei 225 rose nearly 1% in morning trade, while markets in Shanghai, Seoul, and Sydney also edged higher.However, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped for a second straight session after China’s July retail sales and industrial production grew at a slower pace than expected.Reuters noted that the CSI 300 index erased early gains, reflecting ongoing concerns about China’s prolonged real estate slump, high youth unemployment, and weak consumer sentiment, pressures worsened by the US-China trade war.On Wall Street, stocks ended largely flat on Thursday after strong US producer price inflation dampened hopes of a larger interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve next month.“What it did was to get rid of all the chat about a 50 basis point cut,” said Mike Houlahan of Electus Financial, as quoted by Reuters.Markets are now pricing in a 92% chance of a quarter-point cut, with no expectations of a half-point move.Oil prices eased in Asian trade, reversing Thursday’s gains. According to AFP, traders are cautious ahead of Friday’s Alaska summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Stephen Schork of the Schork Group warned that a failed meeting could lead to “stronger sanctions on Russian oil, making it much more difficult for this oil to get to the market.”Key regional indices at 0230 GMT showed Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 up 0.9% at 43,036.46, Shanghai Composite up 0.3% at 3,675.05, Hang Seng down 1.1% at 25,236.62, and Brent crude slipping 0.1% to $66.76 per barrel.","Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the April-June quarter, surpassing forecasts.

Japan recorded modest economic growth in the April–June quarter, overcoming the pressure of steep US tariffs, official figures showed on Friday.Preliminary data from the Cabinet Office indicated that gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.3% from the previous quarter, outpacing market expectations of 0.1%. The January–March reading was also revised up to 0.1% growth from a previous estimate of contraction, avoiding what could have been a technical recession.On an annualised basis, the economy expanded 1%, higher than forecasts of 0.4% and following 0.6% growth in the prior quarter, reported news agency AFP.Economists polled by Reuters had anticipated a weaker performance, but robust exports, which contributed 0.3 percentage points to GDP after a sharp drop in Q1, helped support the uptick, according to CNBC. Japan’s trade deficit also narrowed in the second quarter.The improvement offers some relief to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose political future has been under strain after his coalition lost its majority in the upper house in July.“This is a welcome sign, but the economy still faces many downside risks,” said Yoshiki Shinke of Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, as quoted by AFP, cautioning that export volumes could come under pressure if automakers adjust pricing to offset tariffs.Japan’s auto sector, a key employer and export driver, has been hit by US duties of up to 27.5%. A recent trade agreement reduced the rate on cars to 15%, but the change has not yet taken effect. Toyota has warned of a $9.5 billion tariff impact this year, while Honda and Sony have scaled back their earlier loss projections.The Bank of Japan recently upgraded its 2025 fiscal growth forecast to 0.6% but warned that global trade tensions and weakening overseas economies could weigh on corporate profits.Analysts, including Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics, expect growth to slow in the coming quarters, with inflation pressures likely prompting the BoJ to resume tightening in October.","Japan recorded modest economic growth in the April–June quarter.

The long-term rate declined from 6.63% last week, while a year ago it averaged 6.49%, AP reported.Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, favoured by homeowners refinancing loans, also eased to 5.71% from 5.75% last week, compared with 5.66% in the June 2024 quarter, Freddie Mac said.Economists attributed the decline to a combination of market expectations and recent economic data. “Homebuyers who have been relegated to the sidelines by high financing costs got some encouragement in the past two weeks, but it remains to be seen if it’s enough to get more of them back in the game,” said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.Mortgage applications jumped 10.9% last week, largely driven by refinancing activity, which accounted for nearly 47% of all submissions and caused a 23% surge in total refi applications compared to the prior week—the strongest since April. Adjustable-rate mortgage applications rose 25% to their highest level since 2022, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported.The latest decline marks the fourth consecutive week of easing rates, bringing the average 30-year mortgage to its lowest level since October 24, when it averaged 6.54%.Mortgage pricing is influenced by the 10-year Treasury yield, which was at 4.29% midday Thursday, slightly up from 4.24% late Wednesday.The recent trend follows weaker-than-expected July US job data, which fuelled speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut its short-term interest rate next month. Analysts noted that a rate cut could stimulate the job market and broader economy but may also push inflation higher, a concern compounded by tariffs under President Trump’s policies.Economists generally expect 30-year mortgage rates to remain above 6% this year, though forecasts from Realtor.com and Fannie Mae suggest an easing to around 6.4% by year-end.The Mortgage Bankers Association reported a 10.9 per cent rise in mortgage applications last week. Most of the increase came from refinancing, which made up 47 per cent of all applications and surged 23 per cent from the previous week, marking the strongest refi week since April.

"PPI spike: US producer prices inflation hit 3-year high in July, tariffs add pressure on businesses",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ppi-spike-us-producer-prices-inflation-hit-3-year-high-in-july-tariffs-add-pressure-on-businesses/articleshow/123307757.cms,"Trump’s Worst Nightmare? India & China Join Forces To Crush American Hegemony Amid Tariff War

US producer price inflation surged in July to its highest level since 2022, with fresh signs that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are driving up business costs, official data showed Thursday.The producer price index (PPI) jumped 0.9% month-on-month after being flat in June, according to the Department of Labor, AFP reported. The figure far exceeded the 0.2% rise forecast by Briefing.com analysts, pushing the annual PPI to 3.3%.Much of the increase came from services, which rose 1.1%—the biggest jump since March 2022—while goods costs climbed 0.7%. “The advance was broad-based in July, but more than three-quarters can be traced to services,” the Labor Department said, noting that trade services, a volatile category linked to wholesaler and retailer margins, drove much of the gain.Economists said the headline increase may be overstated by volatile components, but underlying price pressures are evident, particularly in goods exposed to tariffs. Trump’s 10% levy on most trading partners, along with steeper duties on sectors like steel and aluminium, has been squeezing margins.“Input costs for producers jumped in July as price pressures for businesses build from compounding tariff impacts,” said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide.“While businesses have assumed the majority of tariff costs increases so far, margins are being increasingly squeezed by higher costs for imported goods.”Ayers noted sharp recent price gains in steel and aluminium—both targeted with 50% levies—and in food products, which accounted for 40% of the goods price increase in July.Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, warned that “tariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be beginning to wane.”For now, the effects on consumer inflation remain limited, with the consumer price index steady at 2.7% in July. But weaker-than-estimated hiring data has raised expectations of a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.Martin said the PPI figures “provide a counter-balance” to the softer employment numbers and underscore the Fed’s policy challenge. “The big picture remains that inflation is further away from the Fed’s target than the unemployment rate and is likely to climb further over the coming months. The path forward will have to traverse a tight rope between the next employment and price reports,” he added.","US producer price inflation surged in July to its highest level since 2022.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.



THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

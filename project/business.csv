Tax on cigarettes, tobacco products

India may explore increasing the goods and service tax (GST) on tobacco products, including cigarettes, after it stops levying the compensation cess on them.Tobacco products, including cigarettes and pan masala, contribute substantially to government tax collections, with revenue reaching ₹72,788 crore during 2022-23.Currently, tobacco products are subject to 28% GST along with cess and additional levies, amounting to 53% total indirect tax. A proposal under consideration involves elevating GST to 40%, the maximum allowable rate, plus an additional excise duty, according to an ET report.The objective is to maintain tax revenue from these products after the compensation cess ends on March 31, 2026. Officials indicate that introducing another cess to replace the compensation cess is not preferred.A GST Council-appointed ministerial group tasked with examining the post-2026 compensation cess scenario will analyse these proposals. Officials note that cess is not considered an efficient taxation method.These sin goods presently attract compensation cess, basic excise duty, National Calamity Contingent Duty, and 28% GST.The current combined taxation of 53% remains significantly lower than the World Health Organization's recommended rate of 75%.Officials indicated to the financial daily that whilst replacing compensation cess with a health cess is being considered, several states and the central government are hesitant about introducing a new cess structure.Also Read | More tax relief coming? After income tax slab changes in Budget 2025, Modi government eyes GST revamp Currently, a 5% compensation cess applies to products like cigars and cigarettes, with additional specific levies ranging from ₹2,076 to ₹4,170 per thousand units, based on their characteristics such as length, filter presence and flavouring.A group of ministers (GoM) focusing on tobacco taxation was established under former Odisha finance minister Niranjan Pujari's leadership through the GST Council .The GoM recommended modifying the GST cess component, suggesting it should correlate with a product's maximum retail price instead of its sales value.This matter was subsequently directed to a fitment committee and the GoM responsible for rate rationalisation.Additionally, the council requested the GoM on compensation cess to evaluate tobacco taxation considering two possibilities: incorporating the cess into the existing slab or implementing an alternative cess system.","Tobacco products, including cigarettes and pan masala, contribute substantially to government tax collections.

"UPI users take note! Google Pay follows other PhonePe and Paytm, to introduce convenience fee for these transactions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/upi-users-take-note-google-pay-introduces-convenience-fee-for-these-transactions/articleshow/118407751.cms,"Introduction of platform fees for bill payments by Google Pay indicates a wider movement towards monetising UPI transactions.

Google Pay, a prominent UPI ( Unified Payments Interface ) platform, has begun implementing a convenience fee for utility bill payments , including electricity and cooking gas bills. Previously free for low-value transactions, the service now charges between 0.5% and 1% plus GST for payments made using credit and debit cards. With this, Google Pay now follows some other UPI apps like PhonePe and Paytm that charge similar fee.This development follows the platform's previous implementation of a Rs 3 convenience fee for mobile recharges implemented over a year ago.A review by ET revealed that a customer paid approximately Rs 15 as ""convenience fee"" whilst settling an electricity bill with a credit card. The charge, which included GST, was also described as a ""processing fee for debit and credit card transactions"".An industry insider explained to the financial daily that the introduction of platform fees for bill payments by Google Pay indicates a wider movement towards monetising UPI transactions , as service providers aim to recover payment processing costs. The source added that fintech firms are striving to achieve a balance between expansion and sustainable revenue as UPI usage increases.Also Read | Tesla India entry: Why Donald Trump has said it would be ‘very unfair’ for Elon Musk’s Tesla to set up a factory in India Google Pay maintains a significant market presence, handling approximately 37% of UPI transactions, ranking second to Walmart-supported PhonePe. The platform processed UPI transactions worth Rs 8.26 lakh crore as of January.According to an informed source, charging convenience or platform fees is standard practice in the industry. The source indicated that while Google Pay previously covered this expense, it has now opted to transfer the cost to users.Google Pay's website indicates that while convenience fees apply to card payments, UPI transactions linked directly to bank accounts remain fee-free. The timing of when these charges were introduced remains unclear.For specific bill payments including water, piped gas and electricity, PhonePe implements convenience fees on card transactions, as stated on their website. Similarly, Paytm levies platform fees between Rs 1 to Rs 40 for UPI recharges and various utility bill payments, including gas, water and credit card settlements.UPI's widespread adoption hasn't translated into substantial revenue for fintech firms. PwC's study reveals that processing UPI person-to-merchant transactions costs stakeholders approximately 0.25% of transaction value.

From 2021, the government began covering MDR costs for these smaller transactions. Transactions exceeding Rs 2,000 permit a 1.1% merchant fee.""The Indian government has played a crucial role in ensuring UPI's growth, covering the costs associated with low-value transactions to encourage adoption,"" an industry executive said. ""However, the absence of MDR for smaller transactions has left UPI platforms with limited avenues to generate revenue directly from users.""UPI's growth trajectory remains strong, with January 2025 recording 16.99 billion transactions worth Rs 23.48 lakh crore.

New Income Tax Bill 2025 : Representing a historic milestone in India’s tax landscape, Hon. Finance Minister – Madam Nirmala Sitharaman has presented the Income Tax Bill, 2025 (Bill) in the Parliament on 13 February 2025.The current Income tax law - Income Tax Act, 1961 (the current Act) was enacted more than six decades ago. With passage of time there were multiple amendments made to the law. Many believed this resulted in the current Act becoming difficult to read, complex to interpret and resulted in unwarranted litigation as well. Hence, it was indeed an opportune time to embark on an exercise to simplify the same. While an attempt was made to this effect a decade ago with the draft Direct Tax Code (DTC) – it never became legislation.Globally as well, countries like the UK, Australia etc., had undertaken similar exercises to enhance clarity and compliance in their taxation laws. Hence, a new simplified income tax law in India was definitely the need of the hour.Also Read | ITR filing with latest income tax slabs post Budget 2025: Will taxpayers with income below Rs 12 lakh have to file tax return? The Bill is prepared by investing more than 60,000 man-hours and has 23 chapters and 2.6 lakh words in comparison to 46 chapters and 5.12 lakh words respectively when compared with the Current Act. The number of Sections has also dramatically reduced from 800 plus sections to 536 Sections only.Secondly the language used in the Bill at many places is extremely lucid and is reader friendly as it has tables and formulas as against the traditional verbose style.One of the most significant aspects of the Bill is the elimination of the concepts of ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’. India is trying to join the league of comparable tax jurisdictions by using one single term ‘tax year’. The current terms of previous year and assessment year was apparently leading to mistakes by taxpayers while filing forms/ challans etc. With now only one term “tax year” it will hopefully avoid confusion.Largely, there are no changes to the definition of residency or even salary related provisions for that matter. In fact the choice of the two tax regimes continues to be available to individual taxpayers. There is no change to the tax rates and capital gains tax regime also remains the same.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025 explained: Top 30 FAQs every taxpayer should check TDS and TCS provisions have been made easier to comprehend by providing tables instead of the existing provisions which have lengthy texts that are open to interpretation issues and quite often difficult to understand. The Bill now also gives the ability for individuals to apply for a Lower or NIL rate of TCS while they purchase a car, pay for foreign tour, or make remittance abroad under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the Reserve Bank of India.It is also interesting to note that elaborate provisions have been enunciated for dealing with transition from the current Act to the new law.There is a clear focus on encouragement of compliance with the mantra of “Trust first, scrutinize later” – as stated by Hon. FM in her recent Feb 2025 Budget speech.As and when the Bill is enacted, the administrative measures for implementing them will be made operational (e.g., publishing of rules, IT infrastructure revamp etc.), keeping in mind the convenience of taxpayers and all stakeholders. For the common man, it is anticipated that the Bill will help in easy understanding of law and smoother tax compliances.","The current Income tax law - Income Tax Act, 1961 (the current Act) was enacted more than six decades ago.

MUMBAI: American private equity fund KKR will buy 51% of HealthCare Global Enterprises , a Bengaluru-based listed company, from fellow private equity player CVC for Rs 3,203 crore, marking its second investment in India’s hospital sector after Baby Memorial Hospital. In 2022, KKR had exited its investment in Max Healthcare Institute.As a result of the stake-purchase deal, KKR will make an open offer to HGE’s public shareholders for an additional 26% at Rs 445 per share in accordance with India’s takeover rules.If KKR fails to achieve 54% ownership through the open offer, it will buy an extra 3% from CVC, according to the investment agreement.

Number of bn-$ GCCs doubles in 5 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/number-of-bn-gccs-doubles-in-5-years/articleshow/118514071.cms,"This is a representational AI image (Pic credit: Lexica)

GCCs set to outshine IT companies in hiring

BENGALURU: The rise of India's global capability centres (GCCs) was nothing short of meteoric. They continue to demonstrate a growing sphere of influence, not merely as execution engines but showcasing their ability to drive strategic initiatives. GCCs are expected to surpass IT services in hiring for the second year in a row, emerging as custodians of process and tech innovation for their parent organisations.The top five Indian IT peers, on the other hand, experienced a modest increase in their workforce during the initial six months of the 2024-25 fiscal year, with a total of 13,000 new hires. This marks a notable improvement compared to the previous year, which saw a significant reduction of nearly 44,000 employees during the same period. However, with a quarter remaining for the year to end, industry experts believe hiring activity is expected to be muted.Some IT firms, including Infosys, Cognizant, Wipro, and HCL, experienced a reduction in their headcount during the Sept quarter of the 2024-25 financial year. This deceleration represents a three-year pattern of decoupling of revenue and headcount, which has led to productivity gains. The shift stems from enhanced automation processes, improved productivity, and a conservative growth outlook, even as many IT firms are facing single-digit growth this fiscal year. Infosys's headcount, for instance, dropped to 3.1 lakh in the Sept quarter of the current financial year compared to 3.4 lakh in the Sept quarter of 2022. Cognizant's headcount dropped by nearly 9,000 to 3.4 lakh, while Wipro's dropped by 29,000 to 2.3 lakh during the same period. Apart from TCS, other IT firms have shown muted hiring activity.Last fiscal year, the Indian IT sector saw a net addition of 60,000 people, taking the total tally to 5.4 million. IT industry body Nasscom did not break this up, but given that the big IT firms saw a decline in headcount, much of the net addition was on account of GCCs. A recent Nasscom-Zinnov report said the number of GCCs is expected to grow to 2,200 by 2030, employing 2.5 to 2.8 million employees. It currently employs 1.9 million people. In 2022-23, GCCs added 2.8 lakh employees, taking their talent base to over 1.6 million.When TOI asked Nasscom about GCCs marching ahead of IT firms in terms of net additions, the IT industry body said, ""As per data analysed of listed technology services companies, net employment increased by over 20,000 in the first half of the year and many companies have also commenced fresher hiring. GCCs have continued their growth momentum and continue to be a source of job creation for technology professionals. Nasscom is currently in the process of analysing all the different industry sectors and their performance in the year and will publish this in Feb 2025.""Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at tech growth advisory firm Catalincs, said that given many IT companies are caught in a low single-digit growth cycle for the second year in a row, the moot question is whether these companies are reinvesting enough into the business to maximise market share rather than maximise margins. ""With hundreds of billions of dollars locked into opportunities driven by structural shifts in technology and business-including cyber security, AI, cloud, and GCC-companies need to make outsized investments to leap into the future rather than play by yesterday's rules. Only when they do that, will we see growth bounce back, leading to a robust increase in revenue, profits, and net headcount addition.""Phil Fersht, CEO of IT research and advisory firm HfS Research, said, ""Our study of 1,800 IT services employees last year revealed widespread dissatisfaction, while many feel under-challenged and ready to jump ship. The problem with the services industry is that when companies provide outsourced services for enterprise customers, it's most often the monotonous tasks the customer can offload at scale, such as application testing, infrastructure monitoring, accounts payables, or receivables.""Fersht said GCCs are reversing this trend by offering up to 30% higher salaries, often more challenging roles, and opportunities to work with cutting-edge technologies and prestigious institutions. GCCs are making IT services desirable once again. ""This resurgence in interest is not only enhancing GCC capabilities but also elevating the entireIndian IT industry, especially during these challenging times for its traditional outsourcing market."" Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO of US-based Everest Group, believes there is a growing need for more internal control as firms move to focus on technology-driven transformation. ""This new realignment is in the early stages, and we expect a growing movement of estates from third-party to GCC, as well as much of the new scope moving into the GCCs.","GCCs are expected to surpass IT services in hiring for the second year in a row.

SIPs in choppy markets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sips-in-choppy-markets/articleshow/118516369.cms,"Why Are SIP Returns For The Last One Year In The Red?

Should This Worry Investors? What Should They Do Now?

What Should Investors Factor In While Starting A SIP?

Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are a popular way to invest in equity mutual fund schemes , with monthly collections touching 26,000 crore. However, as SIP returns from equity funds have slipped into the red for the last year, retail investors with a long-term horizon and well-defined asset allocation and goals should not stop their allocations as a knee-jerk reaction.The value of the units accumulated through the SIP mode of investment over the last one year has fallen due to a sharp decline in the equity markets in the last few weeks. As a result, the net asset value (NAV) of the schemes fell, which has led to a drop in value for investors. The fall has been higher for riskier schemes like small-cap, midcap and some narrow thematic funds, compared to large-cap funds.SIPs help in rupee cost averaging. This method of investing lets you buy a higher number of units when the market is down, thereby averaging your investments. A fall in equity markets should not worry long-term investors using SIP to meet their goals. Typically, if you have staggered your equity SIPs to a long-term goal, assumed a reasonable return of 10-12%, and the monthly investments are in line with asset allocation, risk tolerance and needs, they should not be disturbed by this volatility. There is no reason to stop SIPs due to this fall. However, investors who have blindly started SIPs in mid-cap and small-cap funds without asset allocation or risk tolerance and are merely chasing high returns might need to relook and balance their equity portfolios.Wealth managers believe investors should consider their time horizon, risk tolerance and existing portfolio before starting a SIP. Equity investments are for the long term with a minimum time frame of five years to go through the entire cycle of ups and downs. If they cannot tolerate volatility, they should invest in a large cap-oriented equity fund or hybrid fund. Those opting for mid-cap and smallcap SIPs should be ready to take higher volatility, risks and intermittent drawdowns. Mid-cap and smallcap equity SIPs should form only a small part of their overall equity portfolio and should not exceed 25-40%.",Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are a popular way to invest in equity mutual fund schemes.

Apple's exports estimated at $9 billion

NEW DELHI: Apple could be one of the biggest losers in case the Trump administration decides to slap reciprocal tariffs on import of electronics and smartphones from India as the move may put a spanner in its growing manufacturing investments here.The situation is equally grave for auto component makers, who ship parts worth billions of dollars to the US - estimated at around $7 billion for this fiscal against $1.4 billion worth of American imports - and thus run the risk of losing business in case the US increases tariffs on products coming out of India, an assessment carried out by TOI shows.Apple currently is one of the biggest exporters of electronic goods from India as it ships iPhones to global markets, with the majority of them flowing into China. Estimates put the shipments to the US at close to $8-9 billion this financial year itself with the company increasingly using its India factories to produce massively for the American market. The India products reach the US with zero duty, making it a profitable deal for the company.However, what is bothering the new US administration under Trump is the 16.5% duty that New Delhi charges on phones and other electronics products when they are imported to India. ""The fear of the industry is that if Trump really goes ahead and slaps a reciprocal duty of 16.5% on smartphones and electronics products being shipped out of India, it will immediately reverse the maths against our manufacturing strength,"" a key vendor in the ecosystem said.While a recent decision of the Trump administration to slap a 10% duty on Chinese electronics imports is good news for Indian manufacturing, the situation will completely change if India is brought under a 16.5% import duty regime in America. ""That would mean our manufacturing will become more expensive than China due to the higher duty. So, Apple will really have no benefit of making in India, and would rather find it beneficial to ship its products out of China at 10% duty,"" another vendor said.And it's not just Apple - Samsung is also shipping its India-made devices to the US, and so is Motorola. ""The whole business case for export of smartphones to the US will get disrupted,"" the vendor said.On the front of auto components, the situation is equally tense. ""While we send our parts to the US at a duty of around 1-2% - it'ss zero for many items - India imposes duty across multiple slabs for the components coming from the US. The actual duty ranges between 7.5% and 15%,"" a component maker said.The only saving grace that Indian makers see is the fact that the share of Indian components in the US is minuscule compared to what it buys globally. ""We are just about $7 billion to the overall $300-billion worth of component imports that the US carries out,"" the auto vendor said.","Apple currently is one of the biggest exporters of electronic goods from India.

Given the global trade uncertainty in the wake of geo-political tensions and Trump's aggressive stance, bilateral trade deals can help push exports for both trading partners.Whenever talks have come to a halt, whether it was 2012 (when the UK was still part of the European Union) or in 2023, the issue at the centre of discussions has been the reluctance to provide more visas to Indian businesses and duty cuts by New Delhi for products of interest to the UK, or the EU.For the UK, Scotch is a key area of interest and with India offering concessions to Australia under ECTA, and slashing duties in bourbon for the US ahead of PM Narendra Modi's meeting with American president Donald Trump earlier this month, there is an indication that the bar has been lowered - provided the British negotiators can do a good trade off.The Indian industry has also shown greater flexibility by indicating its support for a lower import price. But it is keen that there is more flow through the bulk route, instead of bottled at origin, so that there is business and employment in India. In return, it wants the UK also to treat Indian spirits in a fair manner. Besides, the domestic industry wants safeguards to ensure that Scotch and alcohol from other European countries do not make their way into India, routed via the UK.For India, business visas are going to be a key demand, especially with govt keen to wrap up ongoing negotiations to boost exports, particularly of labour intensive products, such as textiles, at a time when industry in Bangladesh is going through a rough phase.A duty cut in the UK will help Indian garments keep more favourably with those going from Bangladesh.","The pact has been in the works for the last few years and was moving at a fast pace during Boris Johnson's tenure, before getting caught in the slow lane due to political uncertainty.

US President Donald Trump hinted towards a “possible” trade deal with one of its key targets for tariff policies, China.Trump told the Air Force One reporters that during his first tenure in 2020, the country had already agreed on what he described as ""a great trade deal with China.""Beijing also urged Washington to handle trade disputes with ""mutual respect,"" with the Chinese foreign ministry responding on Thursday that both sides should resolve their concerns through ""dialogue and consultation based on equality and mutual respect.""Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun warned that "" trade and tariff wars have no winners and only serve to damage the interests of people all over the world.""One month since he assumed office, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, targeting not just China but also key trading partners like Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. Earlier this month, he imposed an additional 10 per cent duty on all Chinese imports and is now considering further levies, including a potential 25 per cent tariff on lumber.Meanwhile, China has also hit back with retaliatory tariffs, slapping 15 per cent duties on US coal and liquefied natural gas, and 10 per cent on oil, agricultural machinery, and vehicles. China's commerce ministry urged Washington to refrain from using tariffs as a ""tool for coercion.""However, experts warned that in such a trade war, it is usually the US which has to bear the cost of tariffs.The US President said, “there's a little bit of competitiveness, but the relationship I have with President Xi (Jinping) is, I would say, a great one,"" He further revealed that Xi, along with the leaders of France and Britain, could soon visit Washington for talks.Trump's aggressive tariff strategy has sent shockwaves across global markets. Japan, which has a major auto industry stake in the US, has formally requested relief from the 25 per cent steel and aluminium tariffs set to take effect on 12 March. Japanese trade minister Yoji Muto is expected to visit Washington to call for an exemption, according to Japanese media reports.In Europe, the EU has warned of a firm response if Washington imposes tariffs on its goods.European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic dismissed Trump’s claims of unfair trade ties, calling US-EU relations a ""win-win partnership."" However, he also signalled the Union’s willingness to negotiate, suggesting potential reductions or eliminations of tariffs on industrial products, including automobiles.Within the EU, Germany remains the biggest trade surplus holder with the US, largely due to its thriving automobile and chemical industries, according to Eurostat.Trump’s tariff push is part of his broader plans to reduce the US trade deficit. In 2024, the country’s largest trade surplus stood at $295.4 billion with China, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.However, economic experts warn that tariffs often result in higher costs for American consumers rather than punishing foreign exporters.As the standoff continues, markets remain on edge, with global leaders bracing for what could be a turbulent period in international trade.","US President Donald Trump hinted towards a “possible” trade deal with one of its key targets for tariff policies, China.

Kentucky leaders criticise the decision

KFC’s legacy

KFC , the fast-food giant originally known as Kentucky Fried Chicken, is relocating its corporate headquarters from Louisville, Kentucky, to Plano, Texas, reports BBC news.Parent company Yum! Brands announced the move, which will require around 100 corporate employees and 90 remote workers to relocate in the coming months.The decision is part of Yum! Brands' broader restructuring, aiming to create two main headquarters for its key restaurant chains. KFC and Pizza Hut will now operate from Plano, while Taco Bell and Habit Burger & Grill will remain based in Irvine, California.Texas has become a popular destination for corporate relocations, attracting companies like Tesla, Oracle, and Chevron due to its lack of corporate and personal income taxes. Kentucky, in contrast, imposes a 5% corporate tax, which some analysts believe may have influenced Yum’s decision.“These changes position us for sustainable growth and will help us better serve our customers, employees, franchisees, and shareholders,” said Yum! Brands CEO David Gibbs. He also emphasised that the move would strengthen collaboration and company culture.Kentucky governor Andy Beshear expressed disappointment over the relocation, saying, “I believe the company’s founder would be, too. This company’s name starts with Kentucky, and it has marketed our state’s heritage and culture in the sale of its product.”Louisville mayor Craig Greenberg shared similar sentiments, calling KFC “synonymous with Kentucky.”Despite the headquarters shift, Yum! Brands has pledged to maintain a corporate presence in Louisville. The KFC Foundation, which supports employee education, will remain in the city. Additionally, the company is providing a $1 million endowment to the University of Louisville’s College of Business for scholarships.Yum! Brands also hinted at plans to establish a flagship KFC restaurant in Louisville as a nod to its historic roots.KFC’s origins date back to the 1930s, when Colonel Harland Sanders started selling fried chicken at a service station in Corbin, Kentucky. The brand expanded rapidly, with the first franchise opening in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1952. By 1991, the company rebranded as KFC to move away from associations with unhealthy fried food.Today, KFC operates more than 30,000 restaurants across 145 countries, with Colonel Sanders’ image still an iconic part of its branding.Yum! Brands, which spun off from PepsiCo in 1997 and later merged with Tricon Global Restaurants in 2002, has seen strong financial performance this year. Shares have risen over 10%, driven by successful earnings from Taco Bell and KFC’s international locations.","KFC and Pizza Hut will now operate from Plano, while Taco Bell and Habit Burger & Grill will remain based in Irvine, California.

"Porsche loses 'premium' tag in China, thanks to 'smarter' tech at budget price",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/porsche-loses-premium-tag-in-china-thanks-to-smarter-tech-at-budget-price/articleshow/118342225.cms,"BERLIN: After decades of dominating China's market for high-performance cars with precision engineering, German automakers are losing out to Chinese rivals that have shifted the definition of a high-end car to one that is electric, smart and affordable.Many new Chinese vehicles resemble their German rivals, including the popular Xiaomi SU7, which mimics Porsche's Taycan. The SU7 rivals the Taycan in power and braking, but also includes integrated artificial intelligence that can, for instance, help with parking and greet drivers with their favorite song. The cherry on top: It sells for roughly half the price of a Taycan. As a result, German automakers that for decades commanded China's premium car market are now seeing their sales dwindle, while Xiaomi - a leading Chinese smartphone manufacturer - last year sold more than 100,000 models of the SU7.Among the hardest hit has been Porsche, which reported last month that its deliveries in China plunged 28% in 2024. Although Porsche's sales were up in every other region around the world, the decline in China was significant enough to pull down its global deliveries for the year by 3%.For years, German automakers relied on the Chinese market to make up for weaker demand elsewhere, leading them to ignore deeper problems at home. Chief among them was a reluctance to adopt technology that has come to define driving in China: electric vehicles equipped with sophisticated software and, increasingly, artificial intelligence.Market experts said advances in software and features such as automated driving and remote control had become standard in Chinese electric cars , pressuring European automakers used to cashing in on their brand names to step up their game. ""I think Chinese consumers right now are ready to accept that Chinese companies can produce cars that are considered as premium to them,"" said an economist.This month, Porsche said it would part ways with its finance chief and a top sales executive, both of whom had come under pressure for poor performance, including in China. Last week, Porsche said it would cut up to 1,900 jobs in Germany over the coming years. The SU7 is not yet available for export, but a few models have reached the US. Ford Motor CEO James D Farley Jr. said he had one shipped to Chicagoand ""didn't want to give it up"".Xiaomi has also been testing pared-down versions of its SU7 Ultra, which will be released in China in March, on Germany's storied racetrack, the Nurburgring. In Oct, the car set a record for the ""fastest four-door sedan,"" and industry media and car fans cheered the news, excited that the SU7 had beaten Porsche's Taycan by 20 seconds.

NEW DELHI: Amid Donald Trump's moves to redefine global trade rules, the resumption of negotiations for India's free trade deals with the UK and the European Union later this month are seen as indications that India as well as its two trading partners are willing to moving ahead with the much-delayed agreements in a bid to overcome the impact of protectionist American policies.Almost a year after negotiations had come to a halt, British minister of state for trade policy Douglas Alexander is scheduled to be in the Capital next week to restart the dialogue after elections in both countries.Towards the month-end, a team from EU will arrive, following signs of a broad agreement on the direction of talks after commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal and commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal held separate talks with their counterparts in Brussels, clearly articulating the need to recognise India's development status and sensitivities. Besides, India wants EU to budget for non-tariff barriers and not just focus the talks on duty cuts.The conclusion of the two deals can help India increase trade with these two crucial trade partners, although the talks with the EU are unlikely to be finalised in a jiffy, given the large membership of the trading bloc as well as the difficult ask in several areas.The eagerness to move is visible on the Indian side too, which has dropped its resistance in some of the crucial areas. For instance, in the Budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman agreed to revisit the model bilateral investment treaty , a major demand from the UK and EU.Similarly, by cutting the levy on bourbon whiskey and some varieties of wine as well as bikes over the last fortnight, govt has signalled its willingness to other trade partners that it can lower duties in case it gets something in return. The latest duty cut on bourbon has also resulted in demands from the local industry to ensure that doors also open for Indian goods in overseas markets.""Govt needs to safeguard the interests of Indian liquor manufacturers while deciding on issues related to customs duty cuts (basic customs duty and agriculture cess) and other concessions under FTAs. Though we have already recommended to govt to cut basic customs duty on spirits over a period of 10 years, we also want govt to ensure better international market access, especially the western countries, and safeguard interests of Indian companies against any dumping of products,"" said Anant S Iyer, director general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies, which represents domestic manufacturers.","The resumption of negotiations for India's free trade deals with the UK and the European Union later this month are seen as indications that India is willing to move ahead.

What are reciprocal tariffs?

Are

Indian tariffs

actually high?

How will reciprocal tariffs work?

So, what next?

What's the implication for the US?

US President Donald Trump has vowed to impose what he calls reciprocal tariffs on countries, such as China, Brazil, France, the European Union, India and others, to ""restore the fairness in US trade relationships and countering non-reciprocal trading arrangements"". The ""Fair and Reciprocal Plan"" ostensibly seeks to ""correct long-standing imbalances"" in global trade and ensure fairness across the board and make US industry competitive.There is nothing like reciprocal tariffs in global trade rules. It's a term coined by US president Donald Trump during his election campaign seeking to hit out at trade partners, such as India, which he asserts have high tariffs on products such as automobiles and alcohol. The idea is to match duties. In simple terms, if Country A sees that Country B places a 20% tariff on goods imported from A, then Country A might decide to match that same 20% tariff on goods it imports from B.A White House Fact Sheet says the average applied US tariff is 5%, compared to 39% in India. It also says that India charges 100% duty on motorcycles compared with 2.4% in the US. The numbers do not factor in the lower tariffs announced for motorcycles in the budget - 40% in completely built form. Besides, Trump is also being selective with facts. Some footwear items attract close to 40% import duty in the US, certain varieties of peanuts are taxed at over 54%, while a few textiles products, such as some of men's and boy's trousers, breeches and shorts face tariffs of 28%. And, the import duty on certain types of tobacco is 350%. While the US cries foul over high duties on alcohol in India, which faces upwards of 100% duty, this is because govt treats it as a sin good, just like tobacco.As for complexity, which India is often criticised for, here is a sample from the US tariff schedule: Certain wrist watches have a specific duty, up to $2.3 each, in addition to 6.25% tariff on the case and strap and 5.3% on the battery. In any case, govt officials and trade experts pointed out that India's duties are in line with commitments undertaken by it at the WTO, which provides developing countries the flexibility to levy higher duties to allow nascent industries to develop. In contrast the caps on tariffs for developed countries are much lower.Trump's statement early Friday only suggests a tit-for-tat action, although it is open to interpretation. The US commerce department will produce the list by April 1. It could mean that the U S authorities prepare item-wise import duty based on what each country levies on American products. The White House Fact Sheet talks about Brazil levying 18% duty on ethanol compared with 2.5% by the US. Or EU imposing 10% duty on imported cars against 2.5% in the US. Some experts also suggested that it could mean product category-wise duties. But all of this is speculation since no details have been spelt out.Trump's statements have in fact added more complexities. He wants to budget for subsidies, other trade barriers and VAT. Now, WTO agreement deals with subsidies separately and is subject to safeguard action. As for VAT, global trade rules allow countries to impose the same level of VAT or GST on a product, that is applicable to a domestically produced item. And, it is over and above customs duty.Most trade experts see Trump's threats as a negotiating tool to get countries on the table. Countries are waiting for more clarity to emerge and some are expecting a trade war with American trade partners responding through other action and challenging the decisions at WTO's dispute settlement body. But successive US presidents, starting with Barack Obama, have made the WTO's dispute mechanism defunct and there is not much hope there.Higher tariffs on imports means that prices in the US will go up, something that Trump admits is a possibility in the short-term. But for the medium-term, he is selling the great American resurgence story, ignoring that wages in the US are so high that it is tough for it to compete with countries where they are lower.","US President Donald Trump has vowed to impose what he calls reciprocal tariffs on countries.

Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, said that his team is working to finalize the details, with tariffs expected to be ready by April 2.

The measure is likely to reshape America's trade relationships and has already sparked reactions from major economies, including India.

Trump’s move follows his campaign promise to crack down on what he sees as unfair trade practices by other countries. He has long accused nations—including allies like India, Japan, and the European Union—of imposing higher tariffs on American products while benefiting from lower US duties.

'Got Trump's Number...': Zelensky's 'Child-Like' Remark On U.S. President's Call Follows Russia Rant

Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security. A White House factsheet on Trump's “fair and reciprocal plan” on trade

How would reciprocal tariffs work?

Tariff imbalances: If a country imposes high tariffs on US imports, the US will match those levies on goods from that nation.

Non-tariff barriers: These include government subsidies, stringent regulations that disadvantage foreign companies, VATs, and exchange rate policies that artificially lower the cost of exports.

Sector-Specific Adjustments: Tariffs may apply to individual products, industries, or as an overall rate on imports from a particular country.

For instance, Brazil currently imposes an 18% tariff on US ethanol imports, whereas the US allows Brazilian ethanol in largely duty-free. Under the new policy, Washington could either raise its own tariffs on Brazilian ethanol or pressure Brazil to lower its duties. Similarly, the European Union charges a 10% tariff on vehicle imports compared to the US’s 2.5%, prompting Trump to label the EU’s trade policies as “absolutely brutal.”

Why it matters

The reciprocal tariffs policy is expected to have a widespread impact on global trade, particularly on emerging economies with high tariff rates, such as India. While the intention is to level the playing field, it could also lead to higher inflation in the US and economic slowdowns in affected countries.

For India, which enjoys a trade surplus with the US, the new policy could mean: Higher costs for Indian exporters, particularly in industries like pharmaceuticals, textiles, and information technology, which are heavily reliant on the US market.

Potential retaliatory tariffs from India, leading to a tit-for-tat trade war that could hurt both economies.

Increased pressure on India to lower its trade barriers, which could lead to long-term shifts in economic policy.

Trump’s order also considers non-tariff barriers, such as value-added taxes (VATs), regulatory policies, and currency exchange rates, which could complicate trade negotiations further.

India has been just about the highest tariff nation in the world...hard to sell to India because of very strong tariffs...whatever India charges, we charge them. US President Donald Trump

The big picture

The US-India trade relationship is currently valued at over $190 billion annually, with a $50 billion surplus in India’s favor.

India’s average tariff rate is around 17%, one of the highest among major US trading partners, compared to the US’s 3.3% average rate.

Under the new policy, tariffs could be adjusted country by country and product by product, meaning Indian goods could face increased duties based on existing disparities.

The US government's decision to impose reciprocal tariffs in response to higher duties from its trading partners is unlikely to have a significant impact on India due to differences in their export profiles, according to economic think tank GTRI on Friday.

The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) provided an example, stating that if the US imposes a 50 percent reciprocal tariff on Indian pistachios because India does the same, it would have little effect since India does not export pistachios.

Furthermore, GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava noted that for 75 percent of US exports to India, the average tariff remains below 5 percent.

On the other hand, India faces steep US tariffs on many labor-intensive goods such as textiles, garments, and footwear, with rates ranging from 15 to 35 percent on several products, he added.

""Given the differences in the export profiles of the two countries, reciprocal tariffs may not have a significant impact...In the new Trump era, India may wait to see the US decision in April on reciprocal tariffs and then respond in equal measures as we did in June 2019,"" Srivastava said.

The US average applied Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff on agricultural goods is 5%. But India’s average applied MFN tariff is 39%. India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles. A White House factsheet on Trump's “fair and reciprocal plan” on trade

How it may impact India

1. Indian industries at risk

Pharmaceuticals: India is a leading exporter of generic drugs to the US, and higher tariffs could make Indian medicines less competitive in the American market.

Textiles: The US is one of the largest buyers of Indian textiles and garments. Increased duties could disrupt supply chains and affect Indian manufacturers.

Information technology: India’s IT sector depends on the US for business contracts, and while services are not directly affected by tariffs, trade tensions could spill over into tech policy.

Steel industry: According to a Reuters report, India's smaller steelmakers could be forced out of business by a further surge in imports resulting from sharp tariff increases imposed by Trump, industry executives warned.

""The increased tariffs may divert Chinese and other Asian exports to India while heightening competition, creating a downward pressure on domestic prices, and affecting small Indian producers with low-cost Chinese dumping,"" said Anubhav Kathuria, managing director of stainless steel producer Synergy Steels.

""We need to protect ourselves from other countries diverting steel to India because we do not have any safeguards,"" said one senior steel company executive, who did not wish to be identified because he was not authorised to talk to the media.

2. Trade deficit and tariff battles

Reducing tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, a longstanding Trump grievance.

Dropping retaliatory tariffs on US almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils, and walnuts in 2023.

However, these moves may not be enough. Trump’s new policy could force India to make deeper concessions or risk losing access to the US market.

3. Potential retaliation from India

US agricultural products, such as soybeans and corn.

Energy exports, including oil and gas. India is a major buyer of US energy, and trade disputes could disrupt agreements.

Aerospace and defense deals, including purchases of Boeing aircraft and military equipment.

India has historically been cautious about trade wars, preferring to negotiate rather than escalate. However, if Trump's policies disproportionately hurt Indian businesses, pressure could mount on the Modi government to respond.

The leaders welcomed early steps to demonstrate mutual commitment to address bilateral trade barriers. The United States welcomed India’s recent measures to lower tariffs on US products of interest in the areas of bourbon, motorcycles, ICT products and metals, as well as measures to enhance market access for US agricultural products, like alfalfa hay and duck meat, and medical devices. India also expressed appreciation for US measures taken to enhance exports of Indian mangoes and pomegranates to the United States. Both sides also pledged to collaborate to enhance bilateral trade by increasing US exports of industrial goods to India and Indian exports of labor-intensive manufactured products to the United States. The two sides will also work together to increase trade in agricultural goods. India - US joint statement

Between the lines

Trump’s tariff move is as much about domestic politics as it is about trade. By pushing for tougher tariffs, he appeals to American manufacturing and agriculture sectors, which he sees as crucial for his re-election strategy.

India’s global trade strategy could shift as a result. With growing ties to the European Union, Middle East, and Southeast Asia, New Delhi may seek new trade agreements to offset US pressure.

The China factor: Trump’s tariffs have historically focused on China, but expanding them to other countries signals a broader protectionist agenda. India must navigate this carefully, balancing its own trade policies while maintaining strong US ties.

What’s next?

Trump’s tariff strategy could go in several directions:

Negotiation and compromise: India and the US could engage in talks to lower tariffs on both sides, preventing a full-scale trade war.

Gradual escalation: If the US raises duties, India might respond selectively, targeting politically sensitive sectors to push for a better deal.

Broader trade realignment: If tensions persist, India could explore alternative markets to reduce reliance on US trade.

India’s diplomatic approach will be key—whether it chooses to push back, negotiate, or make strategic concessions.

President Donald Trump signed an order on February 13 directing his administration to propose “reciprocal tariffs” on US trading partners, a move that could significantly impact global trade. The tariffs, expected by April, aim to match or offset tariffs and other trade barriers imposed on US goods by foreign nations.In trade terminology, “reciprocal” tariffs typically refer to policies ensuring that countries impose similar levies on each other’s goods, aiming for fairness in trade relations. Historically, reciprocity in trade often meant the mutual reduction of trade barriers to facilitate economic growth and global integration. The US Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, for instance, marked a shift away from American protectionism, enabling the US and its trading partners to negotiate lower tariffs on each other’s products.However, the Trump administration sees the current global trade landscape differently. It argues that many US trading partners have maintained policies that disadvantage American businesses, whether through high tariffs, non-tariff barriers, or other regulatory practices. The administration asserts that these policies unfairly benefit foreign exporters while putting American manufacturers at a disadvantage.During Trump’s first term, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross floated the idea of raising US tariffs to match those of its trading partners. Under this “ideal” trade system, the US would lower its tariffs only if other nations did the same. The newly proposed reciprocal tariffs are expected to operate along these lines but with a broader scope, factoring in non-tariff barriers such as value-added taxes (VATs), exchange rate manipulations, and industrial subsidies.Unlike the blanket tariffs Trump previously considered, reciprocal tariffs would be tailored on a country-by-country basis. According to a White House memo distributed to trade officials, the policy will account for several elements beyond simple tariff comparisons. It aims to counterbalance:The impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India will be determined by how far the US goes in adjusting duties and how India responds.India has a trade surplus of around $50 billion with the US, meaning it exports more to America than it imports. Trump has repeatedly criticized this imbalance, arguing that it reflects unfair trade practices.India has already taken steps to ease tensions, such as:If the US imposes higher duties on Indian goods, India could retaliate with counter-tariffs on American exports. This could affect:(With inputs from agencies)","The measure is likely to reshape America's trade relationships and has already sparked reactions from major economies, including India.

Bitcoin bull mania has gripped the crypto market once again. This time, in a meme coin format. Bitcoin Bull ($BTCBULL) just broke the $1 million milestone in its presale.The community-driven token is on a mission to give investors exposure to the BTC bull mania, which is hyped to touch $1 million and beyond. Whenever Bitcoin hits a major price milestone, $BTCBULL holders receive Bitcoin as a reward.BTC is one of the world’s most successful assets. It has registered an AAR (Average Annual Return) of 230%.

TikTok returns to Apple and Google app stores in US after Trump delays ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tiktok-returns-to-apple-and-google-app-stores-in-us-after-trump-delays-ban/articleshow/118232709.cms,"TikTok is back on Apple and Google app stores in the United States after President Donald Trump delayed enforcing a ban on the short-form video platform for 75 days.The Chinese-owned social media platform was reinstated on Thursday evening, weeks after being removed in compliance with a newly enacted law prohibiting its operation in the country.Trump attempted to delay enforcement of the TikTok ban through an executive order, but companies hesitated to restore the app until they were certain it would not violate the law.The legislation, passed last year, mandated that ByteDance , TikTok's Chinese parent company, divest ownership to a non-Chinese entity by January 19. It also imposed significant financial penalties on app store operators and internet hosting providers that continued to distribute or support TikTok.According to The New York Times, TikTok executives expressed optimism during a briefing call on Tuesday that Apple and Google would soon reinstate the app. H. Lee Justine, a TikTok creator and author who participated in the call, confirmed the statement.""They said that the administration had given them a lot of information that they wouldn't be penalized and that they were really hopeful that any day now they would put it back in the app stores,"" she said in an interview.""It makes me very hopeful that they felt that they could do this because hopefully this means that long term there's not going to be issues and this will work out,"" she added.Despite Apple and Google preventing new TikTok downloads, previously installed versions continued functioning normally on American devices.TikTok's reinstatement on app stores is a promising development, granting the company until early April to secure a buyer. This marks a dramatic turnaround—just a month ago, it faced a ban with strong bipartisan support in Congress. The law had even received unanimous approval from the Supreme Court before being overturned by Trump.","TikTok is back on Apple and Google app stores in the United States after President Donald Trump delayed enforcing a ban on the short-form video platform for 75 days.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

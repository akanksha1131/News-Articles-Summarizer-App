Golden Visa Benefits:

In today's uncertain and dynamic global environment, affluent individuals seek alternative arrangements for themselves and their loved ones - arrangements that provide secure havens during turbulent times whilst enabling enhanced access to worldwide commercial and lifestyle prospects.

Golden visas serve as strategic tools for affluent individuals seeking to safeguard their wealth and enhance their global mobility. These programmes are said to offer a reliable safeguard against economic and political uncertainties in an unstable global environment.

The golden visa scheme enables high net worth persons to establish residence in financially advantageous jurisdictions whilst securing comprehensive residential rights, including access to employment, educational institutions and healthcare facilities in the host country.

Some Available Golden Visa Programmes for Indians

According to an ET report, despite tightening regulations, Indian applicants can still access several golden visa schemes:

Portugal continues to offer residency through investments in qualified funds, scientific research initiatives, or business expansion projects.

Greece has adjusted its programme, raising the real estate investment threshold to €400,000, whilst offering a €250,000 alternative route through local startup investments.

Spain's scheme remains accessible to investors who submitted applications prior to 2024, despite plans to discontinue the programme.

Malta maintains its citizenship by investment option, subject to thorough background checks.

Various Caribbean nations, including St. Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and Saint Lucia, provide passports for investments beginning at $200,000.

The UAE golden visa programme continues to welcome Indian investors and professionals from essential sectors, including healthcare, technology, and business.

Singapore's Global Investor Program, whilst not technically a golden visa, enables permanent residency through substantial local business investments.

Golden visa programmes: Countries around the world are strengthening restrictions on unauthorised immigration, whilst maintaining pathways for investment-based residency. Investment visa schemes provide opportunities to obtain residential status or nationality through monetary commitments. Although traditionally popular amongst Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern investors, these programmes now draw applicants from across the globe.Golden visas allow for investment-linked residency on a temporary or permanent basis. These are linked to applicants making qualifying financial contributions, including property acquisition, enterprise establishment or state fund deposits. The flexible residency requirements of certain programmes appeal to those seeking alternative options whilst retaining freedom of movement.A golden visa programme is a legal pathway where qualified individuals receive residential privileges in a country by making specified financial investments. This differs from citizenship-by-investment schemes, which provide complete citizenship benefits. Through golden visas, wealthy individuals can obtain legal residency status, allowing them to live, pursue employment, education and access healthcare services in their chosen nation.Nations increasingly provide residence and citizenship through investment schemes such as golden visa programmes, featuring diverse investment choices tailored to individual family needs.Golden passports provide ""citizenship by investment”. They deliver comprehensive citizenship privileges, frequently including admission to regional economic zones. Within the European Union, Malta's scheme enables investors to live, work and pursue education across all EU member states. In the Caribbean region, nations including St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Grenada provide competitive options beginning at approximately $200,000.US President Donald Trump has introduced the ""gold card"" scheme as a replacement for the existing EB-5 visa system. This initiative would grant residency rights and citizenship prospects in exchange for a $5 million investment. Unlike the current EB-5 programme, the proposed scheme suggests direct payment to the US government to address national debt. This arrangement could present an alternative solution for Indian investors facing extensive waiting periods in the current employment-based green card system.",Golden visas allow for investment-linked residency on a temporary or permanent basis.

Average cost of preparing vegetarian thali at home goes down in February, but chicken plays spoilsport for non-vegetarians",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/some-relief-average-cost-of-preparing-vegetarian-thali-at-home-goes-down-in-february-but-chicken-plays-spoilsport-for-non-vegetarians/articleshow/118834280.cms,"Vegetarian thali cost saw a 1% reduction year-on-year in February.

In February, the vegetarian thali saw a reduction in cost compared to the previous year, whilst the non-vegetarian thali showed an increase due to higher broiler prices.

The vegetarian thali saw a 1% reduction year-on-year in February, whereas the non-vegetarian thali registered an increase of approximately 6%:

The reduction in vegetarian thali cost was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder

was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder Tomato prices reduced to Rs 23/kg from Rs 32/kg, showing a 28% decrease year-on-year, due to 20% increased supply

LPG costs decreased by 11% year-on-year (to Rs 803 per 14.2 kg cylinder in Delhi from Rs 903) providing additional savings

The decline would have been more substantial if not for the increased prices of onion (11%), potato (16%) and vegetable oil (18%) year-on-year, says CRISIL.

In some relief for the common man, the cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali declined year-on-year in February, according to CRISIL’s latest monthly indicator of food plate cost, RRR (Roti Rice Rate). The cost of a non-vegetarian thali, however grew approximately 6% due to rise in broiler (chicken) prices, the report said. On a month-on-month basis the cost of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian thalis came down.The calculation of an average thali's preparation cost at home by CRISIL considers input prices across different regions of India. Monthly variations indicate the impact on everyday household expenses. The analysis tracks price movements of essential ingredients including cereals, pulses, broilers, vegetables, spices, edible oil and cooking gas.The rise in non-vegetarian thali prices was primarily due to a 15% year-on-year increase in broiler (chicken) prices. Broiler (chicken), which constitutes approximately 50% of a non-vegetarian thali's cost, saw this increase due to previous year's low baseline when prices had fallen because of oversupply.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know Additionally, higher feed expenses, resulting from a 6% year-on-year increase in maize prices, contributed to the overall cost surge.During the month, both vegetarian and nonvegetarian thali costs decreased by 5% compared to the previous month. This reduction was attributed to fresh supplies causing price drops in onion (7%), potato (17%), and tomato (25%). Additionally, broiler (chicken) prices fell by an estimated 5% month-on-month due to reduced demand following bird flu concerns in southern India.","In February, the vegetarian thali saw a reduction in cost compared to the previous year.

Wall Street ended lower on Tuesday, extending a turbulent period of losses as uncertainty over US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies continued to shake investor confidence.Trump said late in the afternoon that he would “probably” reconsider doubling planned tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, just hours after announcing a sharp hike. The back-and-forth on tariff measures against some of the United States’ closest trading partners has rattled markets, compounding fears of an economic slowdown.“The volatility is nothing new to us over the course of the last three weeks,” said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management. He noted that market swings have been “largely driven by the uncertainty around things like tariffs.” However, he also pointed out that Tuesday marked a potential shift, saying, “For the first time in three weeks, it appears as though we might be getting a little bit of good news… there might be a window cracked open in the negotiations with Canada on tariffs.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1%, closing at 41,433.48. The S&P 500 slid 0.8% to 5,572.07, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.2% to 17,436.10. The downturn followed Monday’s significant plunge, which saw the Nasdaq suffer its worst single-day loss since 2022.Since taking office, Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, though he has at times walked back some levies on key trading partners.“Certainly, the longer this uncertainty persists, the more investors are willing to take money off the table and de-risk their portfolios,” Hogan added.Despite the general market decline, the Nasdaq found some support from major tech stocks. Tesla rebounded 3.8% following Trump’s announcement that he would purchase one of the company’s vehicles, while AI chipmaker Nvidia climbed 1.7% after suffering steep losses on Monday.Tuesday’s losses deepened fears that Wall Street could be heading into a correction phase. At one point during the session, the S&P 500 briefly fell more than 10% below its record high from last month, a level that professional investors define as a correction.The S&P 500 ultimately fell 0.8% but fluctuated throughout the day, at one stage dropping as much as 1.5%.

NEW DELHI: Airtel gained a significant edge in the domestic telecom market by striking an agreement with Elon Musk’s Starlink to market the broadband and internet satellite services of the American company, while also using the latter’s network to supplement its coverage across the country.Work on the partnership will, however, start only after Starlink – which is awaiting official approval – gets a go-ahead from the security establishment, even as govt works out pricing and other modalities to accord satellite spectrum to satcom companies on an administrative basis.“This is the first agreement to be signed in India, which is subject to SpaceX receiving its own authorisations to sell Starlink in India,” Airtel said in a statement on Tuesday. “It enables Airtel and SpaceX to further explore how Starlink can complement and expand Airtel’s offerings, and how Airtel’s expertise in the Indian market complements SpaceX’s direct offerings to consumers and businesses.”Airtel closed the deal even as the company and its promoter Sunil Mittal has a stake in Eutelsat One Web, which has received a govt licence to operate satcom services in India and is awaiting spectrum.The deal is also surprising as Airtel had recently joined hands with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio to oppose administrative spectrum to satcom companies such as Starlink, demanding that airwaves should only be auctioned.The move will now see the two companies work out retail and network optimisation efforts.“Airtel and SpaceX will explore to offer Starlink equipment in Airtel’s retail stores, Starlink services via Airtel to business customers, opportunities to connect communities, schools, and health centres, among many others, in even the most rural parts of India,” the companies said, adding that they will also explore “how Starlink could help expand and enhance the Airtel network, as well as SpaceX’s ability to utilise and benefit from Airtel’s ground network infrastructure and other capabilities in the country.”Bharti Airtel MD and VC Gopal Vittal said working with SpaceX to offer Starlink to Airtel customers is a “significant milestone” and demonstrates the company’s commitment to offer next-generation satellite connectivity. “This collaboration enhances our ability to bring world-class high-speed broadband to even the most remote parts of India, ensuring that every individual, business, and community has reliable internet. Starlink will complement and enhance Airtel’s suite of products to ensure reliable and affordable broadband for our Indian customers – wherever they live and work,” he said.SpaceX president and COO Gwynne Shotwell said the company is “excited to work with Airtel and unlock the transformative impact” Starlink can bring in India.Airtel said it remains committed to offer comprehensive and reliable connectivity and digital solutions leveraging advanced technology with a focus on customer-centric services. “By adding Starlink, (in addition to its existing alliance with Eutelsat OneWeb) to its offerings, Airtel will further its ability to offer nationwide connectivity and connect previously underserved areas, particularly those with limited to no coverage today. With Starlink enterprise suite, Airtel will be able to offer enterprises, businesses, and communities comprehensive and seamless connectivity packages.”","Airtel, SpaceX to work on network, retail synergies.

Concerns over governance gaps



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





MUMBAI: IndusInd Bank shares plunged 27% on Tuesday to Rs 656, erasing Rs 19,000 crore in market value — the sharpest drop in its history. The fall followed the bank’s disclosure of Rs 2,100 crore derivatives accounting discrepancy , cutting net worth by 2.4%. The stock hit its lowest since Nov 2020, making it Nifty 50’s worst performer in a year.Markets feared that a sharp fall in the price of the bank shares would trigger margin calls for the promoters — Mauritius-based IndusInd International Holdings — who have pledged nearly half their 15% holdings as of end-Dec 2024. Shares of other small private banks — Bandhan Bank and RBL fell by 5% and 2.7% respectively, as investor sentiment turned wary.The bank’s MD and CEO Sumant Kathpalia in an analyst call on Monday evening said that the post-tax impact of the derivative losses would be around Rs 1,530 crore (2.35% of bank’s net worth). According to Kathpalia, the bank’s capital adequacy and profits were enough to absorb the hit. However, markets were concerned over governance gaps, risk management flaws, and regulatory scrutiny.According to a research report by Macquarie, IIHL holds nearly 15.1% stake in IndusInd Bank, with around 7.7% of total outstanding shares and just under 50.9% of their stake pledged. The loan, initially Rs 3,088 crore in 2021, was topped up on Dec 20, 2024, raising the pledged stake’s value from Rs 4,967crore to Rs 5,554 crore. According to Macquarie, at a share price of Rs 600, the promoters would have to pledge 80% of their holdings to provide margin for their loans.“In our view, clearly there is a significant trust deficit and speaking to investors, they are waiting for change in management to restore credibility and trust here which is going to be a long process. So unfortunately now earnings recovery won’t matter as investors don’t trust the balance sheet, internal processes and compliance,” said Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie in his report.IndusInd Bank, meanwhile, has hired PwC India for an independent review, which is expected by April 2025.","IndusInd Bank shares plunged 27% on Tuesday to Rs 656, erasing Rs 19,000 crore in market value.

NEW DELHI: With India’s workforce undergoing rapid transformation, organisations are re-imagining employee benefits to meet diverse needs and secure top talent. Companies are increasingly adopting innovative solutions, including flexible health insurance plans , mental health support , and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to create a more supportive workplace.Over past five years, there has been a 300% surge in companies offering flexible health insurance plans, with focus on parents, siblings cover and wellness programmes and financial planning tools, ‘The Future of Benefits 2024’ report by Mercer Marsh Benefits said.Employees are demanding greater autonomy in choosing benefits, leading to increased adoption of customisable insurance and wellness programs. The BFSI sector provides the highest sum insured, followed by pharma and IT/ITES/ecom. Further, the IT/ITES/ ecom sector stands out by offering ESCP (employee, spouse, children, parents/in laws) at 73% as a default inclusion, followed by pharma at 64% and manufacturing at 54%, it adds.The report reflects analysis across 14 industries, over 10,000 policies and over 600 benefit evaluations. Employer sponsorship for parental insurance rose from 35% in 2019 to 53% in 2024, making it a key benefit for employee retention and well-being. In India, absence of social security system coupled with differential compensation, drives need to cover parents under employee benefit programmes.Prawal Kalita, MD, Mercer Marsh Benefits India Leader said, “Employee benefits are no longer just about healthcare coverage. They are evolving into holistic well-being solutions.”","There has been a 300% surge in companies offering flexible health insurance plans.

US stocks tumbled Monday as ongoing tariff disputes and concerns over a potential federal government shutdown fueled fears of a looming recession.Last week's sharp selloff continued, gaining steam throughout the session, with all three major indexes posting steep losses.The S&P 500 is now down over 8% from its February 19 all-time high, and the Nasdaq Composite has officially entered correction territory after falling more than 10% from its December peak. A mix of economic uncertainty, fears of a potential recession, and escalating trade tensions has led to a wave of selloffs, wiping out trillions in market value.Also read: BSE Sensex sinks over 400 points; Nifty50 below 22,350 Key factors contributing to this decline include high stock valuations compared to historical averages, economic uncertainty triggered by shifting trade policies, and disappointing corporate earnings. Tesla, for example, saw its market value drop by more than $125 billion in a single day. Additionally, companies like Delta Air Lines have cut their profit forecasts, citing concerns over economic conditions. Investors remain on edge as they monitor upcoming inflation reports, interest rate policies, and potential government actions to stabilize the economy.The recent selloff is driven by multiple factors, including trade policy uncertainties, fears of a potential recession, and concerns over high stock valuations. As Peter Orszag, CEO of Lazard, explains: ""The amount of uncertainty that has been created by the tariff wars with regard to Canada, Mexico and Europe is causing boards and C-suites to reconsider the pathway forward.""The S&P 500 has fallen over 8.6% from its February 19 high, erasing more than $4 trillion in market value. The Nasdaq Composite is officially in correction territory, down over 10% from its December peak.Technology stocks have suffered the most significant losses. Tesla lost $125 billion in value in a single day, while Apple and Nvidia both fell about 5%. The S&P 500’s technology sector dropped 4.3% overall. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines' stock plunged 14% after it cut its first-quarter profit estimates by half.Read also: What could be the impact of Trump's tariff flip flop on Indian stock market? Yes, investor concerns about a potential recession have intensified.In an interview broadcast on Sunday, US President Donald Trump described the current situation as “a period of transition” and didn't dismiss the possibility of a recession. When asked on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo” whether he anticipated a recession this year, Trump replied, “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big.”Ross Mayfield, an investment strategist at Baird, noted: ""The Trump administration seems a little more accepting of the idea that they’re OK with the market falling, and they’re potentially even OK with a recession in order to exact their broader goals.""The White House has pushed back against recession fears , insisting that the economy remains strong despite the market downturn. Kevin Hassett, head of the National Economic Council, said: ""There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward. But for sure, this quarter, there are some blips in the data.""He also suggested that the uncertainty around tariffs would be resolved soon, emphasizing that tax cuts would help boost investment and real wages. However, investors remain skeptical, with ongoing market volatility reflecting broader concerns.Investors are keeping an eye on several key factors, including the upcoming inflation report, interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve, and potential government measures to stabilize the economy. A further retreat in investor confidence could push markets even lower. As Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""Many people have been worried about elevated valuations among US equities for some time and looking for the catalyst for a market correction.""With market volatility continuing, investors should stay informed and consider diversification strategies to manage risk.","The S&P 500 has fallen over 8.6% from its February 19 high, erasing more than $4 trillion in market value.

US stock markets tumbled further on Tuesday after President Donald Trump intensified his trade war by announcing a sharp increase in tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, doubling the planned hike to 50%. The move sent Wall Street reeling, with the S&P 500 falling 1.1% in afternoon trading, pushing it nearly 10% below its all-time high set just weeks ago.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 625 points, or 1.5%, by 1 p.m. Eastern time, extending a brutal stretch of volatility. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dipped a more modest 0.7%, as Tesla and a few Big Tech stocks managed to limit some of the broader market’s losses, according to news agency AP.The S&P 500 experienced another sharp intraday swing, flipping from a modest morning gain to a steep 1.2% decline—a pattern that has repeated throughout the past two weeks. This latest bout of wild market fluctuations reflects investors’ growing uncertainty over how much economic pain Trump is willing to inflict through tariffs in his bid to reshape global trade.While announcing the tariff increase, Trump made an eyebrow-raising statement, saying, “The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty-First State. This would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.”His remark added to the market’s unease, as businesses and investors struggled to gauge whether further trade restrictions could follow.Beyond the immediate market selloff, Trump’s on-and-off approach to tariffs is beginning to take a toll on consumer and business confidence.Delta Air Lines, for instance, warned that customer uncertainty is already impacting demand, leading the airline to slash its revenue growth forecast for the first quarter of 2025 from 7%-9% down to 3%-4%. Delta's stock plummeted 8.5% in response.Similarly, Southwest Airlines lowered its revenue forecast, citing reduced government travel, California wildfires, and weaker demand trends. However, its stock managed to jump 8.7%, as the airline announced new baggage fees and loyalty program adjustments to boost revenue.Meanwhile, Oracle dropped 3.7% after reporting disappointing quarterly earnings, adding to the broader market’s woes.Amid the turmoil, Tesla shares rose 2.1% after Trump publicly declared his intention to purchase a Tesla vehicle as a show of support for Elon Musk’s company. Tesla’s stock has been under heavy pressure in 2025, down 43.8% year-to-date, partly due to Musk’s involvement in federal budget-cutting efforts.Other Big Tech stocks, which powered the S&P 500 to record highs last year, showed relative stability. Nvidia gained 1%, though its year-to-date loss remains at 19.6%, as Wall Street rethinks its overheated enthusiasm for artificial intelligence stocks.The tech sector’s relative resilience has been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise turbulent market environment. Just seven megacap stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—accounted for more than half of the S&P 500’s total gains in 2024. However, analysts at Citi warn that “US exceptionalism is at least pausing”, suggesting that the AI boom may not be enough to offset the broader economic uncertainty in the coming months.International stock markets mirrored Wall Street’s struggles, with major European and Asian indices mostly posting declines. However, in China, Shanghai’s composite index rose 0.4%, as the Chinese government wrapped up its annual national congress with promises of economic stimulus measures.Meanwhile, US Treasury yields steadied after recent declines, with the 10-year yield rising slightly to 4.24%. The bond market has been under pressure in recent months, reflecting growing concerns about economic slowdown risks.Amid the market chaos, a new report showed that US employers posted 7.7 million job openings in January, matching economist expectations. While the job market remains solid for now, ongoing trade disruptions and market uncertainty could have long-term economic consequences.","US stock markets tumbled further on Tuesday after President Donald Trump intensified his trade war.

US job openings climbed to 7.7 million in January, reinforcing the strength of the labour market as President Donald Trump began his return to the White House. The Labour Department’s latest report, released Tuesday, showed an increase from December’s 7.5 million job postings, highlighting a still-resilient employment landscape.Despite this growth, uncertainty looms over the job market as the Trump administration pushes forward with trade disputes, federal workforce cuts, and immigration crackdowns, according to news agency AP.The report, known as the Job Openings and Labour Turnover Survey (JOLTS), showed a slight decline in layoffs and an uptick in the number of Americans voluntarily leaving their jobs—a sign of worker confidence. Job openings increased in key sectors such as real estate, healthcare, manufacturing, and construction.However, federal government job postings dipped to 135,000 in January, down from 138,000 in December. The impact of layoffs stemming from billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiatives is expected to become more apparent in February’s labour data.“These January numbers only capture the earliest days of the DOGE-driven reductions in federal employment,” economists Carol Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics noted in a report. “While this data doesn’t yet reflect major federal layoffs, we anticipate a significant impact in the February report, set for release on April 1.”The Federal Reserve is unlikely to adjust interest rates based on this report, as it continues its cautious approach to monetary policy. “Today’s data provides no urgency for the Fed to cut rates,” Weinberg and Chen wrote. “The labour market remains stable—at least for now.”Job openings have declined from 8.5 million in January 2024 and the peak of 12.2 million in March 2022, when the economy was still rebounding from COVID-19 shutdowns. Hiring has also slowed compared to previous years: employers added an average of 168,000 jobs per month in 2024, down from 216,000 in 2023, 380,000 in 2022, and a record-breaking 603,000 in 2021.In 2025 so far, the economy added 125,000 jobs in January and 151,000 in February, while the unemployment rate remains at a historically low 4.1%.","US job openings climbed to 7.7 million in January, reinforcing the strength of the labour market as President Donald Trump began his return to the White House.

Driving the news

Tesla shares plunged more than 15% on Monday, extending their brutal year-to-date decline to nearly 45%, as investors worried about slowing sales, increased competition, and CEO Elon Musk ’s growing political entanglements.

plunged more than 15% on Monday, extending their brutal year-to-date decline to nearly 45%, as investors worried about slowing sales, increased competition, and CEO ’s growing political entanglements. Adding to Musk’s woes, his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) suffered widespread outages, with tens of thousands of users reporting disruptions. Musk blamed a ""massive"" cyberattack that he claimed was likely orchestrated by a ""large, coordinated group and/or a country.""

The Tesla's $125 billion market cap wipeout came amid a broader selloff in US stocks. In fact, these twin crises for Musk unfolded against a broader backdrop of market panic. The Nasdaq tumbled 4%, its worst single-day performance since 2022, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones also fell sharply. Investors fear the Trump administration’s shifting stance on tariffs and economic policy could trigger a slowdown. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s warning of a “detox period” as public spending is slashed only heightened those concerns.

Tesla’s post-election rally has evaporated, with shares now trading 11% lower than they were on the day Trump won the presidency.

The big picture

Tesla’s delivery numbers are trending downward, despite aggressive price cuts and financing incentives:

Q1 deliveries are tracking for a 4% drop, according to Evercore ISI.

Tesla has launched 0% financing deals and free Supercharging to stimulate demand.

The Cybertruck launch has been rocky, with initial sales well below Musk’s estimates.

Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury: ""Tesla was already facing increased competition across all price points. Now, politics adds another layer of polarization.""

What they’re saying

Investor Doug Boneparth on X: “Massive crash in Tesla stock. Musk will be fine. Retail investors? Not so much.”

JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman: “For how much longer can the stock remain divorced from the fundamentals?”

Protest organizer Alex Winter (in Rolling Stone): “Detaching Musk from Tesla would be a meaningful blow against this administration … and a strike against what they hold most dear: money and power.”

To Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans, Elon Musk is “putting it on the line” in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World’s great automakers, and Elon’s “baby,” in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for. They tried to do it to me at the 2024 Presidential Ballot Box, but how did that work out? In any event, I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American. Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN??? US President Donald Trump

Between the lines: The #TeslaTakedown movement and Musk’s political troubles

Musk’s response: ‘Always look on the bright side’

X outage: Cyberattack or self-inflicted wounds?

Musk has drastically cut X’s security staff since taking over Twitter, raising questions about whether the outage was due to a cyberattack—or simply self-inflicted infrastructure failures.

Reports indicate that over 40,000 users were affected during peak outages.

Cybersecurity experts say that while botnet attacks are common, Musk’s claim that Ukraine was involved is questionable without further evidence.

Since Musk acquired X, the platform has suffered multiple technical issues—leading some analysts to blame underinvestment in infrastructure.

March 10 was a brutal day for Elon Musk-the world's wealthiest person . Tesla ’s stock took a sharp nosedive, his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) suffered widespread outages due to what he called a “massive cyberattack,” and protests against his leadership role (DOGE) in President Donald Trump ’s administration continued across the US.Musk is facing mounting pressure on multiple fronts: Tesla’s declining sales, political backlash against his role in Trump’s administration, and growing skepticism over the company’s lofty valuation.In Europe, Tesla sales have plummeted this year—down 71% in Germany, 45% in Norway, 44% in France, and 44% in Spain. In China, the company is losing ground to domestic competitors offering cheaper and more advanced electric vehicles. Even in the US, Tesla has resorted to aggressive discounts, low-interest financing, and free Supercharging to prop up demand.Competition is heating up, with China’s BYD surpassing Tesla in EV sales and rolling out driver-assistance technology as a free feature—undercutting Tesla’s pricey Full Self-Driving (FSD) package.For years, Musk’s cult-like following helped insulate Tesla from market realities. But now, that aura is fading, especially as his deepening ties to the Trump administration alienate a growing segment of consumers.Musk’s role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—the administration’s controversial effort to slash federal agencies—has made him a polarizing political figure. His sweeping layoffs and budget cuts have sparked backlash, including nationwide protests at Tesla dealerships.The #TeslaTakedown movement has gained traction on social media, urging Tesla owners to ditch their vehicles and investors to dump their stock. Protesters gathered outside Tesla showrooms in multiple cities over the weekend, with signs reading “Stop Musk’s Crime Spree” and “Elon is Trump’s Executioner.” Some Tesla owners have even defaced or covered up their car’s logo to distance themselves from Musk, the Axios report said.Adding fuel to the fire, Musk himself has embraced right-wing rhetoric, frequently engaging with controversial figures on X. His political leanings, once seen as a sideshow, are now becoming a business liability. A growing number of consumers are rethinking their Tesla purchases, unwilling to support a CEO they view as aligned with the administration’s most extreme policies.Even some investors are starting to wonder if Musk’s political involvement is distracting him from running Tesla. The company has fallen behind in key areas—its long-promised $25,000 car was quietly scrapped last year, while competitors like China’s BYD are racing ahead with innovations. Tesla’s recent focus on robot axis and AI-driven vehicles has yet to materialize into tangible revenue, making the stock’s once-lofty valuation harder to justify.According to a report in Axios, even as his personal net worth took a $16 billion hit on March 10, Musk appeared unfazed.Asked about Tesla’s struggles in a Fox Business interview, Musk laughed it off, quoting Monty Python: ""Always look on the bright side of life!""In the past too, Musk has quoted Monty Python.His confidence has long reassured Tesla investors, but some are starting to question whether the optimism is still warranted.Tesla’s path forward is uncertain. While Musk insists the company will be fine long-term, it faces serious short-term challenges:Can Tesla reverse its sales slump? Musk has promised a $25,000 EV, but no firm timeline exists.Will political backlash grow?

Artificial intelligence at work

Almost every day, Grant Lee, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, hears from investors who try to persuade him to take their money. Some have even sent him and his co-founders personalised gift baskets.Lee, 41, would normally be flattered. In the past, a fast-growing startup like Gamma, an artificial intelligence company he helped establish in 2020, would have constantly looked out for more funding. But like many young startups in Silicon Valley today, Gamma is pursuing a different strategy. It is using AI tools to increase its employees’ productivity in everything from customer service and marketing to coding and customer research.That means Gamma, which makes software that lets people create presentations and websites, has no need for more cash, Lee said. His company has hired only 28 people to get “tens of millions” in annual recurring revenue and nearly 50 million users. Gamma is also profitable. “If we were from the generation before, we would easily be at 200 employees,” Lee said. “We get a chance to rethink that, basically rewrite the playbook.”The old Silicon Valley model dictated that startups should raise a huge sum of money from venture capital investors and spend it hiring an army of employees to scale up fast. Profits would come much later. Until then, head count and fundraising were badges of honour among founders, who philosophised that bigger was better.But Gamma is among a growing cohort of startups, most of them working on AI products, that are also using AI to maximise efficiency. They make money and are growing fast without the funding or employees they would have needed before. The biggest bragging rights for these startups are for making the most revenue with the fewest workers. Stories of “tiny team” success have now become a meme, with techies excitedly sharing lists that show how Anysphere, a startup that makes the coding software Cursor, hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than two years with just 20 employees, and how ElevenLabs, an AI voice startup, did the same with about 50 workers.The potential for AI to let startups do more with less has led to wild speculation about the future. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has predicted there could someday be a one-person company worth $1 billion. His company, which is building a cost-intensive form of AI called a foundational model, employs more than 4,000 people and has raised more than $20 billion in funding. It is also in talks to raise more money.With AI tools, some startups are now declaring that they will stop hiring at a certain size. Runway Financial, a finance software company, has said it plans to top out at 100 employees because each of its workers will do the work of 1.5 people. Agency, a startup using AI for customer service, also plans to hire no more than 100 workers.“It’s about eliminating roles that are not necessary when you have smaller teams,” said Elias Torres, Agency’s founder. The idea of AI-driven efficiency was bolstered in Jan by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that showed it could build AI tools for a small fraction of the typical cost. Its breakthrough, built on open-source tools that are freely available online, set off an explosion of companies building new products using DeepSeek’s inexpensive techniques.“DeepSeek was a watershed moment,” said Gaurav Jain, an investor at the venture firm Afore Capital, which has backed Gamma. “The cost of compute is going to go down very, very fast, very quickly.” Jain compared new AI startups to the wave of companies that arose in the late 2000s, after Amazon began offering cheap cloud computing services. That lowered the cost of starting a company, leading to a flurry of new startups that could be built more cheaply.Before this AI boom, startups generally burned $1 million to get to $1 million in revenue, Jain said. Now, getting to $1 million in revenue costs one-fifth as much and could eventually drop to one-tenth, according to an analysis of 200 startups conducted by Afore. “This time, we’re automating humans as opposed to just the data centers,” Jain said.But if startups can become profitable without spending much, that could become a problem for venture capital investors, who allocate tens of billions to invest in AI startups. Last year, AI companies raised $97 billion in funding, making up 46% of all venture investment in the United States, according to PitchBook, which tracks startups. “Venture capital only works if you get money into the winners,” said Terrence Rohan, an investor with Otherwise Fund, which focuses on very young startups.",Gamma is using AI tools to increase its employees’ productivity in everything from customer service and marketing to coding and customer research.

China retaliated against President Donald Trump's tariffs with an additional 15% tax on key American farm products, including chicken, pork, soybeans and beef.The escalating trade tensions punished US markets Monday as investors fearful of the damage from from Trump's trade wars put their money elsewhere.The Chinese tariffs, announced last week, were a response to Trump's decision to double the levy on Chinese imports to 20% on March 4. China's Commerce Ministry had earlier said that goods already in transit would be exempt from the retaliatory tariffs until April 12.Imposing tariffs on imports is a key part of Trump's agenda. He believes the import taxes can raise money for the Treasury, protect American industries and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants in a range of issues, including immigration and drug trafficking.On Wednesday, Trump is set to remove exceptions on 25% steel tariffs he imposed in 2018 - effectively raising the taxes - and raise his levy on aluminum from 10% to 25%.In a bewildering series of announcements last week, Trump slapped tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, then delayed many of them for 30 days. Next month, he could plaster ""reciprocal tariffs'' - meant to raise U.S. tariffs to match higher tariffs imposed by foreign countries - on a wide range of imports from around the world.Economists warn that tariffs raise prices for consumers and make the US economy less efficient as protected American companies have less incentive to innovate.There's also the threat of retaliation, and farmers, who are among Trump's most loyal supporters and also have vigilant defenders in Congress, make a tempting target.China also hit American farm products during the president's first-term trade wars. US farm sales to China plummeted, then recovered after the two countries reached a truce in January 2020 and Beijing promised to buy more from US farmers. American farm exports to China peaked at $38 billion in 2022, then fell to $29 billion in 2023 and $25 billion last year. In January, they were down 56% from a year earlier, according to the US Department of Agriculture.During his first term, Trump spent tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer money to compensate farmers for lost exports.","China retaliated against President Donald Trump's tariffs with an additional 15% tax on key American farm products.

Wall Street’s sell-off deepened Monday, with growing concerns about the economy and President Donald Trump’s tariffs driving US stocks further from their recent record highs.In early trading, the S&P 500 dropped 1.4%, following its worst week since September. As of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 430 points, or 1%, and the Nasdaq composite had fallen 2.1%, according to news agency AP.The primary US stock market measure is now headed for its seventh swing of more than 1%, up or down, in the last eight days, after a tumultuous period dominated by fears that Trump’s on-and-off tariffs could either directly harm the economy or create enough uncertainty to paralyze US companies and consumers. The S&P 500 is down 7.4% from its all-time high reached on February 19.The economy has shown signs of weakening, mainly reflected in surveys indicating increased pessimism. Additionally, a real-time collection of indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests the US economy could already be contracting.When asked over the weekend about the possibility of a recession in 2025, Trump told Fox News Channel, “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing.” He added, “It takes a little time. It takes a little time.”On the same weekend, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would take effect Wednesday.While the US job market remains stable and the economy ended last year with solid growth, economists are lowering their forecasts for 2025. For instance, at Goldman Sachs, David Mericle revised his US economic growth estimate to 1.7% from 2.2% for the end of 2025, primarily due to higher-than-expected tariffs. He now sees a one-in-five chance of a recession in the next year.The sell-off has notably hit some of Wall Street’s biggest stars the hardest, particularly Big Tech stocks and companies benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom in recent years.Nvidia dropped another 2.6% on Monday, bringing its year-to-date loss to 18.3%, a stark contrast to its nearly 820% surge in 2023 and 2024.Apple also saw a 3.2% decline, making it the heaviest drag on the S&P 500 after confirming that it would delay the AI update to its Siri personal assistant until 2026.The downward trend isn't limited to Big Tech; investors are also pulling back on various investments that had previously seen unstoppable momentum, including bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s value has dropped to around $83,000 from more than $106,000 in December.In the midst of this uncertainty, investors have flocked to US Treasury bonds as a safer bet. This surge in demand has led to higher Treasury prices and lower yields.The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.24% from 4.32% late Friday. It has been on a downward trend since January when it was nearing 4.80%, amid growing economic concerns.On Wall Street, Redfin saw a sharp 77% increase after Rocket announced it would acquire the digital real estate brokerage in an all-stock deal valued at $1.75 billion. Rocket’s stock, however, sank 9.7%.Internationally, European indexes also dropped, following a mixed session in Asia.Indexes in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell 1.8% and 0.2%, respectively, after China reported that consumer prices fell in February for the first time in 13 months. This marks the latest indication of weakness in the world’s second-largest economy, as weak demand was exacerbated by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 430 points, or 1%, and the Nasdaq composite had fallen 2.1%.

What is deflation and why are economists worried?

The ongoing price decreases have negatively impacted business earnings, employee compensation and government revenue. Sustained deflation could potentially result in diminished business investments and reduced consumer spending, says a Bloomberg report.

What’s causing deflation?

Four Flash Sales in a day in China



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Rising prices or inflation is a common headache for economies around the world. But what about falling prices? Believe it or not, a sustained fall in prices, commonly known as deflation, is just as big a concern for governments, as is inflation. And, that’s the issue that the world’s second largest economy, China, is grappling with!Recent data indicates China's consumer price index declined by 0.7% year-on-year in February, falling short of projections, whilst producer prices decreased by 2.2%, continuing a downward trend since September 2022.China’s expanding industrial capacity has contributed to export growth, yet it is simultaneously creating deflationary pressures domestically.According to a Reuters report, February's consumer price index recorded its steepest decline in 13 months, alongside persistent producer price deflation. This downturn reflects reduced seasonal demand and consumer hesitancy in spending, influenced by employment and income uncertainties.Also Read | ‘Elon Musk doing amazing work, but…’: Why Sajjan Jindal believes Tesla won’t find it easy in India Following Beijing's recent pledge to enhance consumption amidst escalating US trade tensions, analysts anticipate continued deflationary pressures in China's economy, the report said.Deflation occurs when prices of goods and services decrease across the board. During such periods, currency value increases with time. For many years, economists have expressed concerns about deflation.Whilst deflation appears advantageous for consumers, who can buy more with their income over time, the effects of falling prices are not universally beneficial. Economists worry about how price decreases affect different economic sectors.Also Read | Donald Trump's tariffs: India may be among least vulnerable Asian economies in trade war with US - but there's a catch! China's deepening deflationary concerns may continue beyond temporary seasonal variations, unless governmental action addresses the surplus production capacity that's affecting price levels.Financial institutions such as Citigroup Inc. and Nomura Holdings Inc. express concern that consumer prices might remain near negative territory throughout the year if domestic production continues to exceed consumer demand.With the People's Bank of China currently focusing on maintaining yuan stability rather than implementing monetary stimulus, addressing deflation will likely depend on policymakers' success in managing excess production capacity, the Bloomberg report said.As noted by Citigroup economists, including Xinyu Ji, whilst rebuilding consumer confidence could require several months and largely depends on property market stabilisation, China's approach to supply-side reforms would be crucial for addressing factory-level deflation.China's rising youth joblessness, at 15.7%, is affecting consumer spending. With employment and income uncertainties, Chinese shoppers are increasingly patronising discount retailers, even as industrial production grows despite weak household spending.Financial experts indicate that the growth of such discount businesses is contributing to deflationary trends, which could impact economic growth as these shops gain popularity over traditional retailers, similar to Japan's experience in the 1990s.""The broader shift toward more value-for-money purchases will play a role in deflationary pressures,"" Lynn Song, chief Greater China economist at ING was quoted as saying by Reuters.""This sort of intense price competition likely adds some pressure on more traditional retail models as well,” Song said.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know In its report, Reuters quoted an interesting example, symptomatic of China’s deflation.At the expansive Wankelai establishment in Beijing, manager Leo Liu conducts sales through a microphone, offering increasingly substantial discounts during flash sales until he successfully sells items including a cotton jacket and a ladies' undershirt.Reflecting China's deflationary economic conditions, Liu secured a buyer for the jacket at 20 yuan, a fraction of its original 239 yuan ($33) price tag. The 39-yuan undershirt had to be given away as no customers were willing to purchase it!The store, which offers clothing, snacks and everyday household items near Beijing's financial district, conducts these sales four times daily!Widespread price reductions have emerged across sectors, from eateries offering 3-yuan breakfast deals to automotive manufacturer BYD reducing one of its vehicle prices to under $10,000.Local coffee chain Luckin has overtaken Starbucks as the market leader by offering more affordable options.","Deflation occurs when prices of goods and services decrease across the board.

Seven & i Holdings Ltd announced that its convenience store brand 7-Eleven is planning to explore potential store sell-offs with Canadian firm Alimentation Couche-Tard (ACT).This decision follows a series of measures introduced by Seven & i just days ago to counter a takeover bid from ACT, while also addressing antitrust concerns ahead of a possible merger.""Joint outreach by financial advisors to ACT and 7&i to potential buyers has begun,"" the parent firm said in a statement.The company, which has fully owned 7-Eleven, the world's largest convenience store brand, since 2005, is now taking steps to determine if a deal could be structured in a way that satisfies regulators.ACT has agreed to work with Seven & i to outline a divestiture plan, which includes defining the operational, management, and financial aspects of the stores that could be sold, as well as identifying potential buyers.“This would provide some insight into the prospects of success along terms that had a reasonable likelihood of satisfying US antitrust regulators,” the company added.Seven & i believes these discussions will help determine whether a “credible and actionable remedy and divestiture package can be achieved that would allow a realistic assessment of ACT's proposal.""Earlier, the company had announced a major share buyback and plans to list its US unit on the stock market, another development in an ongoing procedure that began last year when it rejected ACT’s initial $40 billion buyout offer.Seven & i dismissed the bid in September, arguing that it undervalued the business majorly and would likely face regulatory obstacles. If the deal were to go ahead, it would mark the biggest-ever foreign takeover of a Japanese firm, bringing together the 7-Eleven and Circle K brands to create a global convenience store giant.Japan’s Yomiuri daily reported that ACT’s revised offer, which was reportedly raised to around $47 billion, has already been rejected by a special committee.Seven & i has also appointed its first foreign CEO, Stephen Dacus.The company operates around 85,000 convenience stores worldwide, with about a quarter of them located in Japan, where 7-Eleven serves in daily life items, selling everything from fresh rice balls to concert tickets.ACT, which started with a single store in Quebec in 1980, now runs nearly 17,000 convenience stores worldwide, including Circle K.",7-Eleven's parent firm Seven & i Holdings Ltd is planning to explore potential store sell-offs with Canadian firm Alimentation Couche-Tard (ACT) This decision follows a series of measures introduced by Seven &i just days ago to counter a takeover bid from ACT.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118830828,imgsize-91110,width-400,resizemode-4/118830828.jpg"

Consumer prices fell in China in February for the first time in 13 months, as persistent weak demand was compounded by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.The National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday that the consumer price index dropped 0.7% in February compared with a year ago. On a monthly basis, prices were down 0.2% from January.While many other countries wrestle with inflation, China's policymakers face flat to falling prices, and the possibility they could evolve into a deflationary spiral that would drag down the economy. The government stressed the need to increase domestic demand and consumer spending in an annual report last week to its ceremonial legislature, the National People's Congress, but held back on unveiling any dramatic new steps to boost the economy.The Lunar New Year, a time when spending rises for travel, dining out and entertainment, came in late January this year instead of February, as it's based on the cycles of the moon. Holiday spending helped drive the consumer price index up 0.5% in January, but it then fell last month compared with 2024's elevated level.Factoring out the impact of the holiday, the index rose 0.1% last month, Dong Lijuan, a statistician at the government's statistics bureau, said in a written analysis.That is still far lower than ideal. Last week's government annual report included an inflation target of 2% for this year, but it is likely to fall far short of that goal. The consumer price index was flat in 2024, rising 0.2%.Besides the early Lunar New Year, two other factors contributed to falling prices in February, Dong said: Better weather boosted farm production, driving down the price of fresh vegetables and automakers also stepped up promotions to try to boost sales, reducing prices for new cars.The producer price index, which measures the wholesale price of goods, fell 2.2% in February, the statistics bureau said. Producer prices have been falling more sharply than consumer prices, putting pressure on companies to cut labor and other costs.The falling prices are a symptom of both weak consumer spending and a massive expansion of factories to build electric vehicles, solar panels and other green-energy products, encouraged by government subsidies.A burgeoning trade war with the United States could add to China's economic challenges, which include a prolonged real estate market crisis that is weighing on consumer confidence.Government ministers, speaking to journalists at the National People's Congress on Sunday, pledged continued efforts to stabilize the real estate market and said that expanding employment in the current economic environment would be ""a heavy task.""The employment situation is showing signs of improvement but the foundation for economic recovery remains unstable, said Wang Xiaoping, the minister of human resources and social security.""The pressure on total employment remains unchanged,"" she said, noting that people are facing difficulties finding work and raising their incomes.For real estate, a portion of this year's 4.4 trillion yuan ($600 billion) in special local government bonds would go toward purchasing completed but unsold housing projects and converting them to affordable housing, apartments for young people, staff dormitories and other uses, said Ni Hong, the minister of housing and urban-rural development.The government will also expand a program to rehabilitate older housing including adding all compounds built before 2000 to its urban renovation scheme, he said.","Consumer prices fell in China in February for the first time in 13 months.

Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats have added volatility to global stock markets, with India emerging as a key player in the US president’s trade realignment strategy.India put a 9.5% tariff on US goods, while the US imposes just 3% on Indian products. As reciprocal tariffs loom, industries like automobiles, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and steel are at risk. Despite a short rally this week, the Nifty remains down 14% from its peak, with smallcaps in bear market territory. Over $15 billion has been pulled out by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in 2025 alone.Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have maintained their selling trend in Indian equities this March, with total equity outflows reaching Rs 24,753 crore as of March 7, bringing the year-to-date total to Rs 1,37,354 crore in CY25, according to ET report.India is particularly vulnerable to tariff hikes, with key sectors facing significant threats. The Indian Rupee has weakened, and foreign investment is retreating due to concerns about a slowdown.Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets said that India’s automobile, pharmaceutical, textiles, and steel sectors could face severe impacts. However, India’s diplomatic approach—focused on trade negotiations and tariff rationalization—could help mitigate risks. YES Securities suggests reducing tariffs on US imports like steel and encouraging American companies like Tesla to enter India, which could serve as leverage against potential retaliatory tariffs.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, explains that markets perceive Trump’s moves as temporary negotiations rather than long-term tariff impositions, acknowledging that sustained tariffs could hurt the US economy. In response, China and Germany have already implemented domestic stimulus measures to counterbalance the effects of Trump’s policies, adding another layer of complexity to the global economic landscapeThe pharmaceutical sector, which holds 35% of the US market, faces short-term challenges but may benefit in the long term due to India’s competitive advantage over China. Amisha Vora, Chairperson & MD of PL Group, emphasized that despite tariff concerns, India remains more competitive than China, which faces a 20% tariff. Sandip Sabharwal, a market expert, pointed out that large-cap pharma stocks like Sun Pharma and Lupin have already experienced sell-offs but remain well-positioned unless tariffs escalate significantly.Despite global uncertainties, Indian markets show resilience. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, noted that India’s markets have remained strong despite equity outflows from emerging markets.Amisha Vora sees the current dip as an investment opportunity. “With ongoing reforms and India’s demographic advantage, the market will likely perform better, even amidst trade wars,” Vora told ET suggesting a potential correction of 4-5% in the short term.","Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats have added volatility to global stock markets.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge. The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-104558088,imgsize-2534,width-400,resizemode-4/104558088.jpg"

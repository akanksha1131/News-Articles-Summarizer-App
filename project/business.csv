Trump Blocks India’s Crucial Chabahar Plan With Sanctions; $120M Investment In Iran At Risk

Chabahar port sanctions: What is the latest move from US?

What do sanctions on Chabahar port mean for India?

Why is Chabahar port important for India?





At a time when India and the US are looking to seal a trade deal, the Donald Trump administration has dealt a fresh blow to India’s trade and strategic ambitions by removing sanctions waivers from Chabahar port Since 2018, India has been operating the Shahid Beheshti terminal at Chabahar, enabling New Delhi to establish trade routes and deliver humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and Central Asian nations while circumventing Pakistan.The withdrawal of exemptions was anticipated for months following Trump's executive order in January. The State Department and Treasury Department officially announced the decision earlier this week, citing their strategy of ""maximum pressure on Iran"" due to its alleged ""support to regional terrorist proxies and advance weapons systems that pose a direct threat to US forces and our allies.""The Secretary of State has withdrawn the sanctions exemption granted in 2018 under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act (IFCA) for Afghanistan's reconstruction and economic development, aligning with President Trump's stringent policy to isolate Iran. This revocation takes effect from September 29, 2025. The State Department announced that following this revocation, individuals operating the Chabahar Port or participating in IFCA-related activities could face sanctions.This decision directly impacts India's state-operated India Ports Global Limited (IPGL), which has managed the Shahid Beheshti terminal at the port since 2018. The initial waiver was provided by the Trump administration under IFCA, recognising the port's significance for Afghanistan's reconstruction and economic growth.The removal of the waiver represents an unexpected setback from the United States for India, as Chabahar functioned as a strategic counter to Chinese regional dominance, particularly in relation to the China-supported Gwadar Port in Pakistan. These ports are positioned merely 170 kms apart.Chabahar was essential not only for delivering humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, which Pakistan had obstructed, but also functioned as a crucial centre for the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). This multi-modal transport initiative aimed to establish connections between India, Iran, Russia, and Central Asia.In ancient times, before Pakistan's establishment as a nation-state, the renowned historian Al-Biruni documented in the Tarikh Al-Hind that India's coastal boundary began at Tiz, which is now known as Chabahar. The name Chabahar translates to ""four springs,"" referring to the area's favourable weather conditions.In 2024, India signed a 10-year pact to operate the strategically vital Chabahar port in Iran, aiming to boost trade with Central Asia. Positioned on the Gulf of Oman and initially conceived by New Delhi in 2003, the port functions as an important transit point for Indian products seeking entry into Afghanistan and Central Asia.This connection will utilize the International North-South Transport Corridor’s road and rail links, allowing India to circumvent Pakistan. India's role in developing Chabahar is frequently viewed as a strategic response to Pakistan's operations at Gwadar port and China's Belt and Road Initiative.On May 13, 2024, Indian Ports Global Limited (IPGL) signed a long-term contract with Iran's Port & Maritime Organization. IPGL plans to contribute about $120 million, complemented by an additional $250 million obtained through debt funding. This agreement, set for a period of 10 years and featuring automatic renewal clauses, replaces the earlier contract.India's contributions feature infrastructure investments—such as expanding road and rail systems—and the possibility for India to become a key destination for Iranian exportsUnder the arrangement, India gains operational authority over the Chabahar port as a result of its financial commitment to port development. This marks the first time India will manage a foreign port.Adjacent to both the Strait of Hormuz and the Indian Ocean, Chabahar offers important strategic advantages.The Kandla port in Gujarat is the closest Indian port to Chabahar, situated 550 nautical miles away, whereas the distance between Chabahar and Mumbai measures 786 nautical miles.Several Central Asian nations, including resource-rich but landlocked countries such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, have shown strong interest in using Chabahar to secure access to the Indian Ocean Region and the Indian market.","In 2024, India signed a 10-year pact to operate the strategically vital Chabahar port in Iran.

What did the preliminary investigation reveal?

What the maintenance records reveal?



What are fuel control switches?







The families of four victims of the June 12 crash of Air India Flight AI171 have filed a lawsuit against US planemaker Boeing and aerospace supplier Honeywell, alleging that faulty cockpit fuel switches caused the deadly accident that killed 260 people.The complaint, lodged in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, claims the accident occurred seconds after the Boeing 787 Dreamliner took off from Ahmedabad for London due to a defective design of the aircraft’s fuel cutoff switches.Honeywell manufactured the switches, which were approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). While the FAA has said the switches themselves do not appear to have caused the crash, the lawsuit contends that their design and placement made them prone to accidental activation.The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages on behalf of the families of Kantaben Dhirubhai Paghadal, Naavya Chirag Paghadal, Kuberbhai Patel, and Babiben Patel—among the victims who perished in the crash, Reuters reported.According to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the Dreamliner took off normally before both of its engines lost power.A cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other, “Why did you shut off the fuel?” to which the co-pilot responded, “I did not.”Investigators found that the fuel switches had been flipped to “CUTOFF,” cutting power to both engines. Though the crew reset them to “RUN” within 14 seconds, triggering an automatic engine relight—the aircraft had already lost critical thrust.The plane entered a steep descent, crashing into a nearby building just 32 seconds after takeoff. CCTV footage confirmed the deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT), a backup power source used during complete engine failure. The AAIB report also ruled out bird strikes, noting no evidence of avian activity in the area.Of the 229 passengers, 12 crew members, and people on the ground, only one passenger survived.The preliminary investigation indicated that Air India had not carried out all suggested inspections for the aircraft model. Maintenance records revealed that the throttle control module, which houses the fuel switches, was replaced in 2019 and 2023 on the ill-fated plane.However, the AAIB noted that “all applicable airworthiness directives and alert service bulletins were complied with on the aircraft as well as engines,” suggesting regulatory requirements had been met.Despite this, the lawsuit argues that the switches’ location just below the thrust levers “effectively guaranteed that normal cockpit activity could result in inadvertent fuel cutoff.”Aviation safety experts, however, told Reuters that the switches’ design makes accidental activation highly unlikely.Legal analysts note that while most aviation accidents result from multiple factors, lawsuits against manufacturers are common because airlines enjoy liability caps that aircraft makers do not, according to Reuters.Fuel control switches regulate the flow of fuel to an aircraft’s engines. They are essential during engine start-up, shutdown, and in-flight emergencies. On the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, the switches are placed below the thrust levers.If moved to “CUTOFF,” the switches immediately cut power to the engines. Aviation engineers stress they are designed to resist accidental activation.However, once flipped, their impact is immediate, leaving little room for recovery, as tragically demonstrated in the Air India crash.",The families of four victims of the June 12 crash of Air India Flight AI171 have filed a lawsuit against US planemaker Boeing and aerospace supplier Honeywell.

'Forget Free Trade Pact': Top EU Diplomat Sounds Warning To India Amid Trump Tariff War

EU to phase out Russia LNG imports?





Looking to pressurise Russia, the European Union is now looking to hasten its phaseout of Russian liquefied natural gas imports. The new plan aims to stop imports of Russia’s LNG ahead of its original 2027 deadline, following recent calls from US President Donald Trump for stronger measures to limit Moscow's energy trade.The Trump administration has been pushing European allies to accelerate their reduction of Russian fuel imports. Additionally, the US has been advocating for imposing substantial tariffs of up to 100% on India and China for their continued purchases of Russian oil.The EU's initial timeline had set the end of 2027 as the target date for completely eliminating Russian LNG imports, but the new measures could significantly advance this deadline.According to a Bloomberg report, the European Commission is considering including provisions in its upcoming sanctions package to expedite the elimination of Russian LNG imports before the end of 2027. The new sanctions proposal could be announced as early as Friday.The EU is also exploring the possibility of fast-tracking the Russian LNG phaseout through modifications to its RePowerEU plan, which was established to reduce dependency on Russian energy supplies.""Since we presented the RePowerEU plan in 2022, we've been saying that a phaseout of Russian energy is better sooner rather than later,"" Commission Spokeswoman Anna-Kaisa Itkonen said.The EU is focusing on targeting Russian LNG instead of imposing tariffs on India and China, as many member states remain hesitant about broader sanctions, according to the Bloomberg report.The EU's ability to phase out Russian gas is supported by an expected surplus in the global gas market by late 2024, which could help prevent supply shortages and price spikes in Europe.The United States has expressed strong interest in expanding LNG exports to Europe, with current EU imports from the US standing at approximately 50 billion cubic meters annually. Around twelve EU countries have LNG infrastructure in place.The recently signed EU-US trade deal includes a commitment from the EU to purchase $750 billion worth of US energy over the next three years, with increased LNG imports being a key component.Despite significant reductions in Russian gas flows to Europe following the 2022 Ukraine invasion, Russian supplies through Turkish pipelines and LNG shipments still constitute nearly 19% of total EU imports in 2024.Spain, Belgium, and France currently lead EU nations in Russian LNG imports.The EU's approach includes two distinct pathways. While LNG sanctions require unanimous support from member states, RePowerEU plan proposals only need a qualified majority vote.""Spanish companies have increased substantially our purchases of LNG from the US, so somehow we're getting away from Russia,"" Spanish Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo told Bloomberg Television. ""It's good that we have a specific calendar, and if we can push ahead more rapidly, then that's good news as well.""A draft regulation for ending Russian LNG imports by 2027 is under review by the European Parliament and EU Council members, with both bodies able to suggest amendments.The RePowerEU measures would implement permanent changes, unlike sanctions package measures which could be reversed if sanctions on Russia are lifted.""Europe has made huge efforts and been very successful in reducing our reliance on Russian energy and Russian gas,"" Paschal Donohoe, who leads the meetings of euro-area finance chiefs, told Bloomberg Television. ""The Commission have indicated that they want to bring forward the proposal to further accelerate the reduced reliance we would have on Russian energy, and I know that efforts will be made to do that.""",The European Union is looking to hasten its phaseout of Russian liquefied natural gas imports.

India’s first large private gold mine at Jonnagiri in Andhra Pradesh is poised to begin full-scale production shortly, Deccan Gold Mines Ltd (DGML) Managing Director Hanuma Prasad said on Thursday.The project, developed by Geomysore Services India Ltd in which DGML holds a stake, has received environmental clearance in June and July, while state approvals are also being sought.“The project stabilisation is going on... it is only the technology of the plant which is being worked out... full-scale production will begin very soon,” Prasad told PTI on the sidelines of the CII India Mining Summit 2025.Once stabilised, the Jonnagiri mine is expected to produce 750 kg of gold annually, scaling up to 1,000 kg within two to three years. “India’s production of gold as of today is 1.5 tonnes... once our mine starts, nearly one more tonne will be added,” Prasad said.India imports nearly 1,000 tonnes of gold every year, making it the country’s second-largest import after oil. The Jonnagiri project is located in Kurnool district, across Jonnagiri, Erragudi and Pagadirayi villages.Founded in 2003, DGML is India’s only listed gold exploration company with assets across the Indian peninsula, Kyrgyzstan, Finland and Tanzania.","India’s first large private gold mine at Jonnagiri in Andhra Pradesh is poised to begin full-scale production shortly.

Goyal Hails PM Modi’s ‘Zero Defect, Zero Effect’ Vision at 89th IEC Meet, Stresses Quality Standards





DUBAI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal is headed to the US Monday to take forward talks for a bilateral trade deal, signaling the proposed agreement is moving ahead after a hiatus of several weeks.""The delegation plans to take forward the discussions with a view to achieve early conclusion of a mutually beneficial trade agreement,"" an official statement said. Last week a team of American officials led by assistant USTR Brendan Lynch was in New Delhi where both countries vowed to intensify efforts for a trade deal.This the first ministerial level dialogue between the two countries after trade talks collapsed over contentious issues .While India's red lines over farm and dairy stay, there is also growing realisation that the talks with the US following 50% tariffs need to take a different approach from other negotiations where reciprocity has always been the key parameter. Goyal's visit to the US for talks was earlier announced by the US ambassador designate to India. Given US President Donald Trump's strategy, countries across the world are realising the need to focus on comparative advantage vis-a-vis rivals.While the first step will be to find a solution to the 25% secondary tariffs on India, ostensibly for its purchase of Russian crude, the next focus will be to negotiate a deal that puts India at level with other countries, given that its exports face 25% reciprocal tariffs compared to sub-20% for its key competitors.""What India is currently facing is nearly an embargo on several of its exports, even as other countries have managed to negotiate deals that seek to ensure that their goods are able to compete favourably,"" said a source in govt. Although govt has maintained that more than half of India's exports, including critical ones such as electronics and pharma, are outside the ambit of tariffs, sectors such as seafood, textiles and leather and footwear shipments are facing rough weather with exporters having to hand out steep discounts to retain clients.Until talks collapsed over the issue of farm and dairy, and allowing genetically modified products, govt was seeking to find a solution to the issue for sectoral tariffs for segments such as automobiles, auto parts, steel and aluminum. But it will be required to offer greater space in the talks now.At the same time, apart from offering concessions, govt will also have to identify product categories where it will substitute the import of goods from other countries, including products such as oil and gas."," commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal is headed to the US Monday to take forward talks for a bilateral trade deal.

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: Even though President Trump’s $10,000 H-1B bomb — if it survives legal challenges — is bound to drive up operational costs for tech firms, Fortune 500 companies and global multinationals are accelerating their bets on India. If companies cannot get Indians to work in the US because of the prohibitive costs, the companies will look to work in India — through GCCs (global capability centres).Positioned as the world’s GCC capital, India offers a powerful trifecta: deep-tech talent, significant cost efficiency, and freedom from crippling visa bottlenecks. With more than 2,600 GCCs already operating, the country has cemented its role as a global engine for innovation, enterprise resilience and business continuity.“Either you can get Indians to work in the US or get work to India,” said Manoj Marwah, financial services GCC sector leader at EY India. “With visa costs going up, the latter is more likely.”In other words, more companies are likely to will bring work and GCCs to India to tap the scale, talent, and cost competitiveness offered by hubs like Delhi NCR and other cities. “The silver lining is that it will stop brain drain from India and the talent will now be available to contribute to the growth of the domestic economy,” Marwah added.Lalit Ahuja, founder of Bengaluruand US-based ANSR, which has helped establish over 150 GCCs in India, said: “With total costs per H-1B worker now exceeding $3,00,000 annually, a senior software architect, for example, can be employed in a GCC to deliver identical output at a fraction of the cost. This change is not about cost anymore — it’s about strategic advantage. Companies that view this as merely a cost increase will struggle, while those who recognise it as an opportunity to accelerate their GCC strategies will thrive. ” Ahuja emphasised that GCCs have always been a lever to navigate immigration uncertainties. “The proposed increase in H-1B fee will now accelerate both GCC adoption and scaling-up. Additionally, we can now expect a lot of Indian professionals employed in the US on H-1B visas or considering opportunities in the US to look very favourably at opportunities with GCCs in India.”We could look forward to “Less H-1Bs, more hiring of native talent, increased GCC, and more automation with AI,” felt Ray Wang, CEO of Constellation Research. “It is a double-edged sword,” said Raman Roy, CMD of Quatrro BPO Solutions. “On the positive side, the expensive H-1B visas will give a boost to more local sourcing and increase the number of GCCs. However, it could impact the transfer of expertise from US to India. ”","President Trump’s $10,000 H-1B bomb is bound to drive up operational costs for tech firms.

Indian IT firm’s US-listed shares fell overnight following American President Donald Trump ’s executive order slapping an additional fee on H-1B visa holders. Infosys ADRs dropped 4%, while Wipro slipped 2% on Friday.Nasdaq-listed Cognizant declined 4.7% on Friday, reflecting investor concerns over stricter immigration policies. Experts warn of an immediate impact on profit margins. “The immediate impact might be on margin. If the existing H-1Bs have to be renewed next year under the new rule, it will have a major impact. Otherwise, companies can manage margins,” said Pareekh Jain, CEO and lead analyst at Pareekh Consulting. Amid uncertainty and prospects of legal challenges, he cautioned that if the rule applies to existing visa holders, it could shave 1% to 2% off sector-wide EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation) margins.Jain added that most subcontractors and local hires in the US — including Indian students entering the workforce via the H-1B route — will be affected, raising delivery costs for IT service providers. According to Venkatraman Narayanan, MD and CFO of Happiest Minds, Indian IT companies now face higher costs.However, he added that “with 94% of our business driven offshore and a global delivery model built over 14 years, we do not foresee significant disruption, though some operational adjustments are inevitable in the short term”.","Infosys ADRs dropped 4%, while Wipro slipped 2% on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Over 5 lakh Indians could be hit by the Trump administration's decision to impose a hefty $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, prompting India's IT ministry to go into mission mode. The ministry has begun coordination with the Indian embassy in Washington DC and is working to ease the entry of Global Capability Centres (GCCs) to absorb high-skilled workers who may return due to the US order.Top sources told TOI govt has reached out to industry body NASSCOM and major IT companies that have a large footprint in the US in terms of manpower and business. ""The immediate priority is to address potential dislocation of both businesses and professionals,"" a senior official said.India's IT exports to the US exceed $100 billion, and thousands of Indian professionals there will be directly affected once Trump's executive order takes effect. Major US tech and financial firms such as Amazon, Microsoft and JP Morgan have advised H-1B staff not to leave America or to return before the Sept 21 deadline.The IT ministry has raised concerns with other ministries and diplomatic channels to ensure India can absorb skilled workers if they come back.""We will see how we can make life easier for GCCs to set up in India. It's an opportunity for more GCCs,"" the source said. ""We will do a range of things to support the industry.""Officials also believe the US decision could hurt American companies hard. ""They are reducing their own competitiveness for whatever reasons. They think they are protecting jobs for Americans, but they are adding to their costs,"" the source said.Govt feels the move underscores the need for Indian IT firms to shift towards more strategic, high-end work instead of remaining primarily a back-end support industry.","India's IT exports to the US exceed $100 billion, and thousands of Indian professionals there will be directly affected once Trump's executive order takes effect.

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: The panic was real. US work visa holders already in India were scrambling to get tickets back to the US to beat the sudden announcement by President Donald Trump of a Sept 21, 12 am EDT (9.30am IST) deadline for a $100,000 fee per H-1B worker, while there were many claims on social media about people, mostly Indian, trying frantically, but unsuccessfully, to get off flights they had already boarded at airports like San Francisco's after the announcement. Leading travel agents said all nine nonstop flights - seven Air India and one each of United and American Airlines - supposed to leave India on Saturday and early Sunday were nearly sold out.Amid the scramble of H-1B visa holders currently in India to return to the US, a one-way economy ticket on an airline’s Delhi-New York flight leaving Saturday night was selling for Rs 1.05 lakh on Saturday afternoon.By evening, American Airlines’ AA 293, scheduled to leave Delhi at 11.30pm and arrive in New York at 6.05am Sunday, was the only option remaining to beat the deadline. Tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft advised their H-1B and H-4 visa-holding employees to return to the US before the deadline, and those in the US to stay put for the foreseeable future, leading to Indian travel companies and airlines anticipating inbound cancellations for the coming festive and wedding seasons.One X user, Kaustav Majumdar, posted from his handle @KaustavMaj94587: “Extremely sad situation.An international flight packed with Indians (coming for Durga Puja) from Bay Area had completed boarding & was due to leave San Francisco airport, when the news about H-1B visa new rules broke. Indians aboard panicked, pleaded to get off the plane, but alas.” A spokesperson for India’s largest online travel agency, MakeMyTrip, said: “There has been a notable increase in last-minute bookings to US since Saturday morning.This increase in bookings for same-day or next-day travel is atypical for a long-haul segment.” At Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport, families queued at ticket counters. “I’ve been calling airlines and agents non-stop for the past six hours,” said Arjun Varma, a software engineer. “All seats are gone or cost a fortune. It feels like the world has turned upside down. It is costing me Rs 2.7 lakh for an economy ticket and I will reach only at 2pm on September 21, so I don’t even know what I am going to do…” he added. For Suresh (name changed), the timing was devastating. He flew to India two weeks ago with his daughter to commemorate his father’s first death anniversary, leaving his wife and toddler in the US. “I am not booking flights in a hurry. I’d rather stay here than risk being deported with my daughter.This is traumatising enough without adding the stress of travel.” Corporate employees in Bengaluru expressed dread. “My manager sent me an urgent note: get on a flight immediately or face the new $100,000 visa fee,” said a data analyst from Bengaluru. “I feel trapped. How do you pack your life in less than 28 hours?” Anil Kalsi, Travel Agents Federation of India V-P, said: “All nonstops leaving for the US on Saturday and early Sunday morning have been nearly sold out.The situation is very fluid as of now. H-1B holders in the US have been advised to stay there and those here have either to beat deadline or their employers have to pay the fee. The Diwali and festive time travel to India by the affected diaspora will be impacted.” Air India currently has 80 weekly nonstops between Delhi, Mumbai & Bengaluru and New York (JFK & Newark), Chicago and San Francisco. It suspended DelhiWashington route from Sept 1. United and American have one daily each on Delhi-New York. Delta hasn’t resumed India flights after March 2020.","US work visa holders already in India were scrambling to get tickets back to the US to beat the sudden announcement by President Donald Trump of a $100,000 fee per H-1B worker.

GST 2.0 impact: Companies rush to hire temporary staff; rate cuts expected to boost festive buying,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-2-0-impact-companies-rush-to-hire-temporary-staff-rate-cuts-expected-to-boost-festive-buying/articleshow/124018944.cms,"



Companies across consumer electronics, e-commerce, automobiles, retail, logistics, and FMCG are rushing to hire temporary staff as India’s festive season kicks off, following reduced GST rates from September 22.Industry experts say many shoppers had postponed purchases earlier this season, which dented sales, but with firms passing on GST cuts through price reductions, buyers are expected to spend more freely, prompting companies to step up hiring and marketing.Staffing agencies including Quess, Randstad, and CIEL HR report that demand is highest for frontline and fulfilment roles. This includes in-shop demonstrators, retail sales staff, warehouse pickers and packers, last-mile delivery personnel, and service technicians for appliances and electronics. Contact-centre and back-office staff are also being scaled up to handle higher order volumes.“Several sectors that already ran festive hiring drives are now extending mandates and adding last-minute temp headcount in response to the GST rate cuts and the expected post-cut sales surge,” Aditya Narayan Mishra, MD of CIEL HR told ET.“Demand is strongest in consumer durables, followed by auto and large BPO/CRM operations,” Mishra further added.Shilpa Subhaschandra, chief commercial officer, Operational Talent Solutions, Randstad India, said, “We are seeing clients, particularly in ecommerce, quick-commerce, consumer electronics, auto, retail, logistics, and FMCG extend and add last-minute mandates beyond their original plans to capture the anticipated jump in festive sales.”Subhaschandra further told ET, ""On average, these additional mandates translate to a 20-25% uplift in temporary workforce requirements versus last year, with quick-commerce platforms showing the largest thrust, expanding headcount by 40-60% to handle surge volumes.""The festive season that began with Onam in August and runs through Diwali, is India’s biggest shopping period, accounting for 25–30% of annual sales for most consumer goods companies.However, early sales during Onam in Kerala and pre-Durga Puja in East India were subdued as consumers waited for the GST reduction. Industry executives expect strong sales to continue through Christmas as pent-up demand is released.Retailers and electronics chains are hiring up to 20% more temporary staff to manage the anticipated rise in demand from Navratri to Diwali. Auto companies including Mahindra & Mahindra and Maruti Suzuki are also increasing staffing requirements, according to recruitment firms. Email queries to these companies went unanswered.Leading electronics retailer Vijay Sales is expanding its temporary workforce by 10–15% this festive season, said director Nilesh Gupta. He added that demand is expected to rise for large-screen televisions and air conditioners, where GST has been reduced from 28% to 18%.Daikin India, a Japanese AC manufacturer, is boosting shopfloor promoters and increasing its marketing budget to recover from a recent sales slump, said managing director KJ Jawa.Great Eastern Retail will also hire more temporary staff in its top 20 high-footfall stores than originally planned, said Pulkit Baid, director of the East and North India-focused electronics chain.Auto companies have increased hiring by 20–25%, while e-commerce staffing is growing steadily at 15–20%, with a further surge expected over the next two weeks, said Nitin Dave, CEO of Quess Staffing Solutions told ET.“While broad salary levels have not shifted significantly, some employers are offering attendance and joining bonuses to attract talent,” he added.","Industry experts say many shoppers had postponed purchases earlier this season, which dented sales.

Trump’s triple whammy tests US-India ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trumps-triple-whammy-tests-us-india-ties/articleshow/124018260.cms,".

The TOI correspondent from Washington:





US President Donald Trump has landed a triple whammy on India by torpedoing the H-1B visa program, days after revoking sanctions waiver on Chabahar port in Iran and weeks after imposing a 50 percent tariff on Indian exports to the US. The Trump White House also maintained a conspicuous silence on the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia mutual defense treaty amid reports that neither country informed Washington of the pact, suggesting a growing US indifference to India’s concerns.Although the MAGA supremo did not specifically mention India while bringing down the hammer on the H-1B program on Friday, and nor did the administration in reference to Chabahar earlier in the week, the triple blow has shaken US-India ties to its foundations, mystifying experts who expected a reset in ties after an exchange of friendly messages between leaders of the two countries over the past week.Terming the latest blow “more bad India-US news,” Derek Grossman, a National Security and Indo-Pacific analyst, sarcastically asked, “How’s the reset going?” Even as India’s commerce minister Piyush Goyal is heading to Washington this week to advance a trade deal that both sides have indicated is imminent.While some observers see in the crackdown on H1B a pressure tactic to bend India on the trade deal, sources familiar with the dynamics of the current White House says the two issues are unrelated and President Trump was convinced of the need to “reform” the guest worker visa program ever since MAGA hardliners persuaded him that American workers were being gamed out of jobs by foreign companies and US big tech acting in tandem.“Nothing excites him more than visions of billions of dollars in revenue and they played that up for him,” a tech honcho who has worked with White House on the issue said on background to preserve his access. “He now truly believes big tech should pay Uncle Sam top dollar if they truly want top talent and that will be a win-win for the US.”On security issues too, experts see a completely haphazard approach in Washington with sections of the administration working at cross purposes. In a recent conversation, a former White House official said the State Department and the Pentagon (now Department of War) appeared to be on a totally different wavelength, hewing to long-established policy of advancing ties with India, while the White House is “on it’s own trip. ” The former official said there is very little regional expertise in the White House now and interagency meetings convened by the National Security Council have been virtually abandoned, replaced by individuals who have the President’s ear advising him on matters on which they have no domain knowledge.In a stunning development last week, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed a mutual defense pact that apparently includes a nuclear cover, days after Israel bombed Doha to take out purported Hamas operatives being hosted Qatar to discuss peace proposals. Although Trump rebuked Israel, saying he was ""not thrilled"" about the strike, US claims that it was notified about the impending attack, but it was too late to stop it, unnerved its allies in the region, eroding trust in American security guarantees.“It’s a s**tshow…no one really knows what is happening…they are just winging it day to day,” the former official said, pointing to Trump’s latest statement that the US wants to get back control of the Bagram Air base in Afghanistan because it is only ""an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.”Indian sources say there will be plenty of “conversations” on all these issues this coming week when external affairs minister S Jaishankar comes to New York for the annual UN General Assembly session, on the sidelines of which he is expected to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his team. But it has become increasingly apparent in Washington that the mercurial MAGA supremo is marching to his own tune and the rest of his cabinet is trying to follow him as best as they can without challenging him.",US President Donald Trump has landed a triple whammy on India by torpedoing the H-1B visa program.

Gold Price Outlook

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices Last week saw a blend of inflation trends & political interference which involved Fed independence risk created a wave of uncertainty, boosting safe haven appeal for gold as it continued to hit record highs.In the US, mixed inflation data, cooling labour markets, and weakening consumer sentiment kept expectations of a Fed rate cut in place. In Europe, political instability in France added to economic pressure, while the ECB held rates steady. China grappled with deflationary pressures & Japan prepared for snap elections.Other asset classes included, global equity markets ending the week higher, while US Treasury yields, & the US dollar weakened, while oil prices edged up.Gold recorded repeated all-time highs edging near to $ 3,700 per oz in the current week. Gold ETF investors continued to be heavy buyers continuing their purchase for third consecutive months with net holdings rising steadily. led by Western funds. (YTD Inflows: 472.7 tonnes inflows. Vs 6.8 tonnes outflows in 2024).In India, Gold ETFs recorded inflows of Rs 2,190 crore in August, the largest since January’s Rs. 3,751 crores.Global central banks now own more gold than US Treasuries for the first time since 1996, indicating a substantial shift in their foreign exchange holdings. Gold has already surpassed the euro as the second most important reserve asset after the US dollar. Adjusting for over four decades of inflation the spot price of gold, also surpassed its inflation adjusted peak of $ 850 set on January 21, 1980 which comes to around $3590 per oz.The current week remains most crucial for gold as the US Fed may announce its monetary policy on September 17, midnight. It is widely expected that the central bank may go ahead to slash its interest rates by 25 bps, as a slight possibility of a 50 bp cut also exists. Overall possibility of 3 rate cuts persists by the end of the year. Having said that, a summary of economic projections which includes projections on interest rate cuts to be released by the US Fed during the meeting remains crucial to be assessed for further direction in precious metal prices.Overall, a likely hawkish cut could bring in profit booking moves in prices. However, chances of any major correction lower remains' limited, as the US labour market shows signs of weakening, where major supports lie at around $ 3620 – 3570 zone (CMP $ 3685). On the higher side, prices could turn volatile in the coming session post release of Fed statement as strong upside barriers could persist at around $ 3,720 – 3,750 per oz in spot. This could translate to a level of Rs. 1,12,000 - 1,12,500 // 10 gm on MCX futures contract on a higher side on a weekly basis.","Gold recorded repeated all-time highs edging near to $ 3,700 per oz in the current week.

What is the penalty for filing a belated return?



Can I claim a refund in a belated return?



How to file ITR after the due date?





Can a belated return be revised?







The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Monday extended the income tax return (ITR) filing deadline for individual taxpayers by one day, from September 15 to September 16, 2025 for AY 2025-26.The extension applies to those not required to undergo an income tax audit. This deadline has not been extended further.So, what happens if one misses the deadline?Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, but it may attract penalties and other consequences.Any ITR filed after the due date is considered a belated return and can be submitted until December 31, 2025. While filing a belated ITR allows taxpayers to comply with the law, it comes with certain limitations, including late fees and other potential consequences.Tax experts advise taxpayers to act promptly and file their ITR by September 16 to avoid unnecessary penalties and complications.Chartered Accountant Hitesh Jain, Partner – Direct Tax, N. A. Shah Associates LLP, explained that under Section 115BAC, effective from Assessment Year 2024-25, the new tax regime is the default option.Jain said, “So if a taxpayer wants to opt for the old regime, then ITR needs to be filed before the due date prescribed under Section 139(1) which is September 15, 2025 for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26).”This means that taxpayers without business income can select the old tax regime only through the original ITR filed on or before the due date. Jain added that deductions such as house rent allowance (HRA), home loan principal and interest under Section 80C, leave travel allowance (LTA), and others cannot be claimed if the ITR is filed after the deadline. In cases where the total tax liability is lower under the old regime, missing the September 15 deadline could lead to a higher effective tax liability.Taxpayers who miss the September 16 deadline for filing their ITR must pay a late fee of up to Rs 5,000. Those with an annual income exceeding Rs 5 lakh will be liable for a Rs 5,000 fee, while individuals earning below Rs 5 lakh will pay Rs 1,000. No late fee is charged for filing a nil belated return.A belated ITR is treated the same as a return filed on or before the original deadline when it comes to refunds. Taxpayers can claim a refund when filing a belated ITR, provided they complete all necessary bank validation and compliance requirements.One has to file an ITR after the due date (belated ITR) by logging into the ITR filing portal and then select the filing section as 139(4). The rest process is the same as filing an original ITR.Belated ITRs can be revised, but only until December 31, 2025. Any revision requests submitted after this date will not be accepted.","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Monday extended the income tax return (ITR) filing deadline for individual taxpayers by one day, from September 15 to September 16, 2025 for AY 2025-26.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON: US lawmakers and community leaders voiced concern over US President Donald Trump's plan to impose a USD 100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, calling the move ""reckless"" and ""unfortunate"" that will have a ""huge negative"" impact on the IT industry.Trump's USD 100,000 H-1B visa fee is a ""reckless attempt to cut America off from high-skilled workers who have long strengthened our workforce, fuelled innovation, and helped build industries that employ millions of Americans,"" Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said.Krishnamoorthi said many H-1B holders ultimately become citizens and launch businesses that create well-paying jobs in the US. ""While other nations race to attract global talent, the United States should strengthen its workforce and modernise our immigration system-not erect barriers that weaken our economy and security,"" he said.Former advisor to president Joe Biden and Asian-American community leader on immigration policy, Ajay Bhutoria, warned of a potential crisis for the US technology sector's competitive edge with Trump's new plan to impose the ""staggering"" H1-B fee.""The H-1B programme, a lifeline for innovation that has attracted top talent from around the world, faces unprecedented barriers with this massive jump from the current USD 2000-USD 5000 total fee, which will crush small businesses and startups reliant on diverse talent,"" Bhutoria said.Bhutoria added that the move will drive away skilled professionals who power Silicon Valley and contribute billions to the US economy.He said the move may backfire by pushing talent to competitors like Canada or Europe. He called for a balanced reform like exempting startups or prioritising merit-based selection instead of ""this extreme overhaul"".Khanderao Kand of the Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies said the USD 100,000 fee for H1-Bs is a very unfortunate policy with huge negative impact on businesses particularly software and tech industry as well as US-educated STEM talent who are already struggling due to negative impact of AI and tariffs.

Trump-Xi call





A proposed US-China agreement on TikTok would give Americans a majority on a board overseeing the app’s US operations, the White House said Saturday.“Americans will control six of the seven seats for a planned board,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News, according to the Associated Press.Leavitt added, “We are 100 per cent confident that a deal is done. Now that deal just needs to be signed, and the president's team is working with their Chinese counterparts to do just that.”Her comments came a day after US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed a TikTok deal in a lengthy phone call.A key issue in ongoing US-China negotiations has been whether TikTok would retain its algorithm following a potential divestment of its China-based parent company, ByteDance.Leavitt noted that “the algorithm will also be controlled by America as well,” offering more detail on how the deal, at least in the eyes of the White House, is taking shape.According to her, tech giant Oracle would be responsible for the app’s data and security. Oracle is led by billionaire Larry Ellison, who briefly became the world’s richest person last week before Elon Musk reclaimed the top spot, pushing Ellison to number 2.Congress passed legislation mandating a TikTok ban to take effect in January. However, Trump repeatedly signed orders allowing the app to continue operating in the United States while his administration worked to reach an agreement for ByteDance, TikTok’s China-based parent company, to sell its US operations.Trump said that American investors were “lined up” and that Xi had been “a gentleman” about the matter, but he remained vague on whether China would retain control of TikTok’s algorithm.“It’s all being worked out. We’re going to have very good control,” he stated. statement from the Chinese government following the call did not clarify what Xi had agreed to regarding the sale of a controlling stake by ByteDance, to avoid a US ban.Leavitt expressed confidence that the agreement would be finalised soon. “Now we just need this deal to be signed,” she said. “And that will be happening, I anticipate, in the coming days.”","Americans will control six of the seven seats for a planned board, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.

China on Saturday said that its position on the TikTok issue in the US is clear and hoped that America will provide an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies.The commerce ministry highlighted that the country ""welcomes companies to conduct business negotiations in line with market rules to reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance the interests of all parties,"" as per ANI citing Xinhua.The ministry stated, as quoted by Xinhua, that China ""hopes the US will move in the same direction and fully honour its commitments, provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies, including Tik Tok, to continue operating in the United States, and promote stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US economic and trade relations.""US President Donald Trump spent a great chunk of this week touting a Tik Tok ""deal"" with China, but experts say it is far from finalised after both sides shared details of his phone call with President Xi Jinping. The two leaders spoke by phone on Friday, their first call in three months, but there was no announcement of the sale of the popular social media app that has 170 million US users, as per Al Jazeera.Despite the lack of any specific developments from Friday's call, experts agree that the leaders talking is in itself a sign of a thaw, especially as Xi had previously refused to get on the phone with Trump, despite the multiple meetings in Geneva, London and most recently in Madrid, Al Jazeera reported.The call was days after Trump extended, for the fourth time, a deadline for China's ByteDance to divest its ownership of Tik Tok or face a ban in the US under a law passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support and one that was later upheld by the Supreme Court.Any hammering out of a bigger trade deal on the multiple other issues, including US access to rare earth metals and China's purchase of Russian oil and access to US semiconductor chips, will have to wait for the two leaders to meet, experts say, Al Jazeera reported.","China hopes the US will provide an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies.

Donald Trump’s $100K H-1B Visa Fee Shocker Sparks Fears Among Indian Tech Workers And US Firms





Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) emerged as the second-largest recipient of H-1B visas in 2025, with over 5,500 approvals, following Amazon, which received 10,044, according to data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).Other top beneficiaries included Microsoft (5,189), Meta (5,123), Apple (4,202), Google (4,181), Deloitte (2,353), Infosys (2,004), Wipro (1,523), and Tech Mahindra Americas (951).In a move that could significantly impact Indian IT professionals in the US, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation imposing a staggering annual H-1B visa fee of $100,000, aimed at curbing what the administration termed “systemic abuse” of the programme.The restriction applies to petitions filed after September 21, 2025, and is set to expire after 12 months unless extended.The proclamation cited a sharp rise in foreign STEM workers in the US, noting that between 2000 and 2019, the number of foreign STEM professionals more than doubled while overall STEM employment grew by just 44.5 per cent. “Information technology firms have prominently manipulated the H-1B system, significantly harming American workers in computer-related fields,” the proclamation said, highlighting that IT outsourcing companies now dominate H-1B approvals.According to USCIS, many US tech companies have reportedly laid off thousands of American employees while simultaneously securing approvals for large numbers of H-1B workers.One firm approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in FY25 laid off more than 15,000 US employees, while another received approval for nearly 1,700 visas and cut 2,400 American jobs in Oregon, as per news agency PTI.Critics argue that H-1B visas are often used for entry-level jobs, allowing companies to save costs by hiring foreign workers at lower wages. The proclamation noted that IT firms could pay up to 36 per cent less for H-1B “entry-level” positions compared with full-time American workers.The new $100,000 fee comes alongside a $1 million “gold card” visa, offering a path to US citizenship for wealthy investors, while a $5 million “platinum card” allows up to 270 days of US stay without taxation on foreign income.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said the fee hike is likely to reduce H-1B applications, noting, “If you have a very sophisticated engineer and you want to bring them in ... then you can pay $100,000 a year for your H-1B visa”.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) emerged as the second-largest recipient of H-1B visas in 2025, with over 5,500 approvals.

Companies dependent on H-1B visas





H-B visa fee hiked! The Donald Trump administration sent shockwaves across the technology sector - particularly Indian IT, by substantially hiking the fee for H-1B visas. The revised regulations mandate organisations recruiting foreign professionals on H-1B visas from abroad to submit a whopping $100,000 payment for each application!This decision could notably affect Indian IT professionals and workers in the United States.This substantial fee aims to discourage programme misuse whilst ensuring access to exceptional candidates. These limitations shall continue for 12 months, subject to potential extension following assessment by federal bodies.The Trump administration has introduced the significant modifications to the H-1B visa scheme through a presidential declaration effective September 21, 2025.Officials state this initiative targets widespread exploitation of the programme, specifically in the IT industry, where domestic employees are displaced by overseas workers receiving lower compensation.The declaration additionally instructs authorities to modify existing wage structures and give preference to specialists commanding higher salaries. The Secretary of Homeland Security retains discretion to grant exceptions where recruitment serves national objectives without compromising security considerations.The H-1B programme serves as a temporary work permit system in the United States, enabling US firms to recruit overseas talent for specialised positions.These positions typically are for roles demanding theoretical knowledge or technical competency in sectors such as IT, engineering, mathematics, medicine and science.This visa arrangement helps address skill shortages in the American labour market by bringing in qualified professionals, initially for three years with possible extension to six years. During this period, the visa holder can legally reside and work in the US whilst maintaining employment with the sponsoring organisation.The scheme requires employers to verify that the position demands specialist expertise and that the international candidate possesses the necessary qualifications. Indian professionals, particularly in technology and engineering fields, constitute a significant portion of H-1B visa recipients.The existing H-1B visa application fees are already high. It varies between $1,700 and $4,500, with the higher amount applicable for expedited processing, according to CBS News. Employers generally categorise these charges as operational business expenditure.It has been hiked by 22.2 times the $4,500 fee that is currently required to be paid by employers for H-1B visas. This means that the H-1B visa fee has seen a 2,111.1% hike from the $4,500 levels.US President Donald Trump's proclamation ""Restriction on entry of certain nonimmigrant workers"" stipulates that entry into the United States for nonimmigrants will require their H-1B petitions to include an additional payment of $100,000.According to the directive, the limitation will end after 12 months from September 21, 2025, unless extended.The document indicated that foreign STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) workforce in the United States increased from 1.2 million to approximately 2.5 million between 2000 and 2019, whilst overall STEM employment only grew by 44.5 per cent in the same period.Within computer and mathematics positions, the proportion of foreign workers increased from 17.7 per cent in 2000 to 26.1 per cent in 2019. The document identified H-1B visa misuse as the primary contributor to this surge in foreign STEM employment.Latest data from federal sources reveals Amazon leads with 10,044 H-1B visa approvals as of June 2025, whilst TCS holds the second position with 5,505 approved visas.Following closely are Microsoft and Meta with 5,189 and 5,123 approvals respectively. Apple secured 4,202 visas, whilst Google obtained 4,181. Deloitte received 2,353 approvals, followed by Infosys with 2,004, Wipro with 1,523, and Tech Mahindra Americas with 951 approvals, according to a PTI report.The directive noted that technology companies have ""prominently manipulated"" the H-1B programme, causing substantial disadvantages to US computer sector professionals.The proportion of IT professionals in the H-1B programme increased from 32 per cent in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 to over 65 per cent on average in the previous 5 fiscal years. Additionally, several major H-1B employers are presently IT outsourcing organisations.The document referenced a technology sector study showing that employing these H-1B-dependent IT outsourcing firms results in considerable cost reductions, with H-1B ""entry-level"" positions costing 36 per cent less compared to traditional full-time employees.The directive claimed that companies are exploiting the system by shutting down their IT departments, dismissing American employees, and shifting IT positions to foreign workers at reduced wages, taking advantage of artificially reduced labour expenses encouraged by the scheme.According to the proclamation, many American technology firms have dismissed their skilled American workforce whilst recruiting thousands of H-1B workers simultaneously.A particular software enterprise received approval for more than 5,000 H-1B workers in FY 2025, whilst announcing redundancies affecting over 15,000 staff members. Similarly, another IT organisation, approved for roughly 1,700 H-1B workers in FY 2025, declared the dismissal of 2,400 American workers in Oregon in July.The proclamation further noted that a third organisation has decreased its American workforce by approximately 27,000 since 2022, whilst receiving approval for more than 25,000 H-1B workers since FY 2022. Additionally, a fourth company, which reportedly eliminated 1,000 positions in February, secured approval for over 1,100 H-1B workers for FY 2025.The USCIS announced in July that it had received sufficient petitions to meet both the standard 65,000 H-1B visa cap and the additional 20,000 master's cap for advanced US degree holders for fiscal year 2026.","H-1B visa fee has been hiked by 22.2 times the $4,500 fee that is currently required to be paid by employers.

Donald Trump tariffs: Container freight rates likely to remain subdued amid uncertainty; expected to correct 10–15%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-tariffs-container-freight-rates-likely-to-remain-subdued-amid-uncertainty-expected-to-correct-1015/articleshow/124010484.cms,"AI image





Container freight rates are expected to remain subdued for the rest of FY26 as uncertainty in global trade continues, driven by US President Donald Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies, industry experts said.According to ET, exporters rushed shipments to the US ahead of the August 27 deadline for a steep 50% tariff on Indian goods, targeting the Christmas season.India’s exports to the US rose 18% year-on-year to $40.39 billion during April-August 2025, far outpacing the country’s overall export growth of 2.5% to $184.13 billion in the same period.Meanwhile, China’s exports to India climbed over 10% to $51.57 billion, exceeding India’s overall import growth of 2.14%, reported ET.Ajay Sahai, director general and CEO of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), said freight rates are likely to see a 10-15% correction due to oversupply amid weakening global demand. “Inflationary pressures are persistent, and the risk of recession in advanced markets could deal a major blow to world trade,” he said, as per ET.The Drewry World Container Index fell 6% sequentially this week to $1,913 per 40ft container, down from more than $4,000 a year ago.On the South East Asia to East Coast North America route, rates dropped to $2,600 per 40ft container from $2,900 ten days earlier and nearly halved from $5,500 a year ago.Bhavik Mota, head of markets (Intra Gulf & Far East, West & Central Asia) at AP Moller - Maersk, said shipments of automotive products have declined sharply, while FMCG exports remain steady and pharmaceuticals are expected to stay resilient. “Exports of shrimp are vulnerable too. With prices climbing for end-consumers due to Trump’s tariffs, this could eventually translate into a larger drop,” he said, as per ET.Smaller Indian exporters are facing the brunt of high US tariffs, with some cancelling orders. “The end consumer will be impacted and it’s going to hurt demand. The large ones are sustaining, but smaller shippers are having problems,” said a senior shipping official.Not all markets are bleak. Improved trade relations with China have supported Indian imports ahead of the Diwali season, with Drewry’s Intra-Asia Container Index rising 5% sequentially to $611 per 40ft container, reflecting firmer regional trade.However, industry officials warn that unless tariffs on India are eased, long-term pressures on global supply chains could intensify.","India's exports to the US rose 18% year-on-year to $40.39 billion during April- August 2025.

Trump Gold Card Visa : Residency through a $1 million investment

Program funding and implementation



Potential Impacts: Immigration and business







US President Donald Trump on Friday announced the launch of the much-anticipated “Gold Card Visa”, a program designed to attract wealthy individuals and corporations by offering them fast-track US residency in exchange for hefty investments.“They’re going to spend a lot of money to come in,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed the order creating the visa program.“It’s going to raise billions of dollars, billions and billions of dollars, which is going to go to reduce taxes, pay off debt and for other good things,” he added.The program introduces a tiered visa system, including the Gold Card ($1 million) and the upcoming Platinum Card ($5 million), along with a separate Corporate Gold Card for businesses sponsoring employees.The Trump Gold Card is the centerpiece of the new visa scheme. Individuals who wish to apply must pay a non-refundable processing fee (estimated at $15,000) and undergo Department of Homeland Security (DHS) vetting.If approved, applicants must make a $1 million contribution to the US Treasury, which the administration defines as a “gift” to demonstrate that the individual will substantially benefit the country.According to the program’s official website: “The Trump Gold Card is a visa based upon an individual’s ability to provide a substantial benefit to the United States. To apply, an applicant must pay a nonrefundable processing fee. Once an applicant’s processing fee is received, the process for visa adjudication will take place… If approved, an individual must make a gift of $1 million, which has been determined to provide sufficient evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States. ”Trump officials said successful applicants will be granted lawful permanent resident status, equivalent to EB-1 or EB-2 visa classifications, but processed in “record time.”The card itself is styled like a luxury credit card. It features a gold background, Trump’s portrait, the Statue of Liberty, and the US flag, with “Trump Gold Card” stamped on the left.The Platinum Card design has not been revealed yet, but the website encourages applicants to join a waitlist immediately, with applications processed on a first-come, first-served basis.According to the program, the Gold Card grants lawful permanent resident status under the EB-1 or EB-2 visa categories, subject to DHS approval. That would put recipients on a path to US citizenship, though officials have not specified exact timelines for naturalisation.The Corporate Gold Card allows companies to sponsor foreign employees. For each worker sponsored, the business must contribute $2 million after DHS vetting and a processing fee.One feature that may appeal to businesses is flexibility. If a company ends the sponsorship of one employee, it can transfer the original $2 million contribution to another worker without paying the amount again.As the website explains, “The Trump Corporate Gold Card is issued to a corporate sponsor for one or more of the sponsor’s employees. To apply, the corporate sponsor must pay a nonrefundable processing fee per employee. Corporate sponsors may apply for multiple employees at once. A $2 million per employee gift upon completion of the employee’s vetting is evidence that the employee will substantially benefit the United States. The advantage of the Trump Corporate Gold Card is that corporate sponsors may cease sponsoring one employee and use the gift contribution tied to the prior application as a basis for sponsoring a new employee without a new $2 million gift. The Trump Corporate Gold Card is subject to a small annual maintenance fee and a transfer fee.”The program, however, includes annual maintenance fees and transfer charges for each reassignment.The Platinum Card, still pending congressional approval, will target ultra-wealthy individuals willing to invest $5 million. In exchange, recipients can reside in the United States for up to 270 days a year without paying taxes on non-US income.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said he expects approval “later this year,” adding that the Platinum Card could significantly expand America’s ability to attract capital.The administration has marketed this tier as a unique mix of residency, extended stay rights, and tax incentives, making it especially attractive to high-net-worth individuals with global income streams.Trump signed an executive order directing that revenue from the Gold and Platinum Cards be deposited into a “separate fund” at the Treasury, earmarked for commerce promotion and debt reduction.Lutnick added that applicants would face “a much more rigorous vetting than has ever been done before,” and that the program would replace existing EB-1 and EB-2 visas.He said other green card categories would likely be suspended once the Gold Card model is implemented. The administration expects the rollout phase to last less than a month.The announcement signals a dramatic reshaping of US immigration policy. The Gold Card would replace traditional skill-based visas like EB-1 and EB-2, while Trump has also proposed a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas, used by technology firms to hire skilled workers.Tech executives could be divided: while the Gold Card allows for new inflows of capital and workers under corporate sponsorships, the higher cost of H-1B visas could burden companies like Accenture and Cognizant. Shares of both firms dipped on Friday following Trump’s announcement.Immigration experts have also raised doubts about Trump’s claim that up to one million Gold Cards could be sold, pointing out that the pool of individuals able to afford the $1 million buy-in is relatively small.Trump first teased the Gold Card program in February, presenting it as an initiative that could draw global capital, create jobs, and reduce the deficit. On Friday, he reiterated its fiscal impact:Despite skepticism about demand, the Gold Card represents one of Trump’s most sweeping attempts yet to monetise the US immigration system while tying it directly to national revenue goals.","US President Donald Trump on Friday announced the launch of the much-anticipated ‘Gold Card Visa’ The program is designed to attract wealthy individuals and corporations by offering them fast-track US residency in exchange for hefty investments.

Donald Trump’s $100K H-1B Visa Fee Shocker Sparks Fears Among Indian Tech Workers And US Firms

Significance of the new rule





US President Donald Trump has signed a new proclamation on Friday (US time) introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications, along with other changes to the skilled foreign worker programme, which has been under scrutiny for years.Originally designed to attract exceptional foreign talent for specialised technical roles, the H-1B programme has evolved into a channel for workers accepting salaries around $60,000 annually—well below the $100,000-plus compensation typical for American technology professionals, according to AP reports.""I think they're going to be very happy,"" Trump said, anticipating the tech industry’s response to the changes.Additionally, White House staff secretary Will Scharf said, ""One of the most abused visa systems is the H1-B non-immigrant visa programme. This is supposed to allow highly skilled labourers who work in fields that Americans don't work in to come into the United States of America. What this proclamation will do is raise the fee that companies pay to sponsor H-1B applicants to $100,000. This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers.It is noteworthy that First Lady Melania Trump, formerly Melania Knauss, received an H-1B visa in October 1996 for modelling work; she hails from Slovenia.Established in 1990, the H-1B programme targets individuals with bachelor's degrees or higher in difficult-to-fill positions, particularly in STEM fields. Critics argue the system enables lower wages and limited worker protections. The annual quota of 85,000 visas has traditionally been distributed through a lottery.Lottery applications fell nearly 40 per cent in 2024, following measures to prevent multiple entries that skewed selection odds. Major tech companies had requested reforms after surging applications reduced individual chances, prompting USCIS (US Citizenship and Immigration Services) to limit candidates to a single lottery entry, regardless of multiple job offers.Amazon currently leads in approvals with over 10,000, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple, and Google, with California hosting the largest H-1B workforce.Detractors note that many H-1B positions are junior-level roles rather than senior specialist jobs. Companies can reportedly reduce costs by classifying roles at lower skill levels while employing experienced workers. This has led to outsourcing of basic technical operations to consultancies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Tata, IBM, and Cognizant, which employ foreign workers—mostly from India—contracted to American firms seeking cost savings.While critics welcome these changes, they are calling for further reforms. The AFL-CIO said the measures are ""some steps in the right direction"" but advocated for visas to be allocated based on highest wage offers rather than random selection—a proposal previously floated during Trump’s first term.The increased fees could affect hiring foreign workers as it'll cost more for companies. Currently, companies pay $215 to register for the lottery and $780 for a Form I-129, the employer-sponsored petition for a non-immigrant worker.The move is expected to discourage mass applications for H-1B visas, particularly affecting startups and small businesses that may struggle to absorb the higher upfront cost. Companies hiring foreign workers will now face significantly higher expenses, potentially shifting focus back to American tech workers.The change also aims to curb abuse of the H-1B system, where companies hire foreigners at lower wages for entry-level roles, while paying Americans significantly more for the same jobs. With the $100,000 fee, hiring foreign talent becomes equally costly, likely reducing opportunities for H-1B-dependent workers.The overhaul comes amid discussions to reform or end the lottery system and raise wage requirements, prioritizing high-wage, high-skill foreign workers and opening more entry-level jobs for US graduates. The administration’s broader goal is to protect American employment in the technology sector.","US President Donald Trump has signed a new proclamation introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications.

Trump SEALS Huge Deal With China's Xi Jinping; Big Announcement Amid Tariff War





Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday urged US counterpart Donald Trump not to impose unilateral trade restrictions, as such actions could undo the progress made through several rounds of talks.In a telephonic conversation, the two leaders discussed current ties between the two nations, issues of mutual concern and provided strategic guidance for the stable development of bilateral ties in the next stage.The call was described as pragmatic, positive, and constructive, ANI reported citing Xinhua.Jinping also highlighted the historic bond between the two countries, recalling their joint efforts during World War II.“Not long ago, China held a grand commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, during which descendants of members of the American Flying Tigers were invited to the Tiananmen rostrum to watch the military parade. The Chinese people will never forget the valuable support that the United States and other anti-fascist allies provided to China during the war of resistance.On the basis of remembering the fallen and honoring history, we should cherish peace and open up the future,” Xinhua cited Xi as saying.The Chinese president further stressed that Beijing-Washington relations are of great importance and said the two nations can achieve mutual success, prosperity, and benefits for both nations and the world.He said that both sides must move toward each other and make joint efforts to achieve mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.Recent consultations between the two teams reflected the spirit of equality, respect, and reciprocity, Xinhua reported. China also emphasised the US should avoid unilateral trade-restrictive measures that would jeopardise progress made during these discussions.Regarding TikTok, China restated that it respects companies’ choices, supports market-based business negotiations, and favors solutions that follow Chinese laws while balancing interests. Beijing also expressed hope that the US would offer a fair, open, and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese firms operating in America.Trump, meanwhile, praised China’s recent military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of victory in the war of resistance, calling it truly spectacular.

Trump Demands Crushing NATO Tariffs On China, Beijing Warns ‘sanctions Only Fuel Global Chaos’





US President Donald Trump on Friday called his conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping a ‘productive one’. According to Trump, the call touched upon various aspects such as trade, fentanyl, and the TikTok deal. Trump also said he would meet Xi at the APEC Summit in South Korea.“I just completed a very productive call with President Xi of China. We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal. I also agreed with President Xi that we would meet at the APEC Summit in South Korea, that I would go to China in the early part of next year, and that President Xi would, likewise, come to the United States at an appropriate time. The call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!” Trump ousted on Truth Social.The telephone discussion comes as both the US and China, the world's largest economies, attempt to reach an agreement regarding tariffs.The conversation marks their second discussion since Trump's January return to the White House, and their third interaction this year.Ahead of the telephone conversation, Trump had said, ""I'm speaking with President Xi, as you know, on Friday, having to do with TikTok, and also trade,"" Trump.""And we're very close to deals on all of it. And my relationship with China is very good.""On June 5, the US president mentioned Xi's invitation to visit China, whilst extending a reciprocal invitation for the Chinese leader to visit the United States.The two countries significantly increased their respective tariffs during a prolonged disagreement earlier this year, causing disruption to international supply networks.Washington and Beijing established an agreement to lower tariffs, which will conclude in November, with the US implementing 30% tariffs on Chinese imports whilst China imposes a 10% levy on American products.The telephone discussion follows Xi's organisation of Shanghai Cooperation Organization this month, where he hosted Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He also invited North Korea's Kim Jong Un to witness a substantial military parade in Beijing.""Please give my warmest regards to (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un as you conspire against the United States of America,"" Trump posted to Xi on his Truth Social platform earlier this month.The American president imposed punitive duties on India regarding its Moscow oil acquisitions and urged European nations to penalise China for purchasing Russian oil, although Washington has not directly sanctioned Beijing.""If they did that on China, I think the war (in Ukraine) would maybe end,"" Trump stated during his Fox News appearance.","US President Donald Trump called his conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping a ‘productive one’ According to Trump, the call touched upon various aspects such as trade, fentanyl, and the TikTok deal.

Building TomoCredit



From personal pain to public purpose



Kristy Kim’s hacks for building credit



Learn about credit early: “Not many people even know what the definition of credit score is. [It is] your likelihood to pay back [a loan] in the next 12 months. Know your score, even at 18 years old. You might have nothing, or something if your parents added you to their file,"" she told CNBC.

Start small: “Borrow small amounts that you can repay easily. Whether it’s $100 or $1,000, proving you can take and repay a loan builds your history. Start small and early. That’s the best hack,” she said.



Redefining access to credit







Landing a banking job in San Francisco in 2011 straight out of UC Berkeley should’ve been Kristy Kim’s ticket to the American dream. The 22-year-old had just landed a job in investment banking in San Francisco and was eager to find her first apartment. But the process quickly turned into a nightmare as every rental application she submitted was rejected.The reason? She didn’t have a US credit score.“It was a lot of struggle... because, here is me, who studied hard, who worked hard to get a job and make money, and realizing that: ‘Oh, I don’t have a credit score in the US , I am credit invisible — a credit ghost,’” Kim told CNBC Make It.Kim had immigrated from South Korea to the US at the age of 11, without family support. With no one to co-sign her lease, she had to improvise.She went directly to a landlord she found on Craigslist and pitched herself. “I basically said: ‘Hey, I don’t have a credit score, but trust me, I have a job and my boss can vouch for me.’” The landlord agreed, and Kim secured her first apartment.The bigger shock came when Kim tried to buy her first car. Repeatedly denied an auto loan because of her lack of credit history, she again tried to think creatively.This time, she walked into her local Citibank branch and asked the manager to vouch for her based on her salary and savings.But the manager explained the rules: the bank’s lending and banking departments were siloed. No one could intervene.“I requested a meeting with the manager ... Basically, I asked her, can you call the auto loan dealership ... and then tell them that I’m a [trustworthy] person ... You guys can see how much money I make,” said Kim.“But she said that it doesn’t work like that. She is not allowed to vouch for me ... [their] banking department and lending department are separate ... so they cannot communicate with each other,” said Kim. “So that’s my ‘aha’ moment that I realized the system is very archaic.”Frustrated, she borrowed money from her family in Korea and bought a used car outright. But the experience left her determined.“It was a lose-lose for everybody. Lose for the auto dealership, because they couldn’t make the sale. Lose for me [because] I had to spend so much cash. And it’s not so great for [the bank] either, because they couldn’t keep me, their customer, happy,” said Kim.Those setbacks planted the seed for TomoCredit, the fintech startup Kim would later found to help others like her — immigrants, students, and young professionals with little or no credit history.Launched in San Francisco, TomoCredit (short for “tomorrow”) provides products designed for people with “thin” or non-existent credit files. The company’s mission is simple: make it easier for people to build credit without facing the systemic barriers Kim once encountered.“That’s why I started Tomo with full confidence,” she said. “I knew there should be millions of Kristy’s out there who had this bad experience. Somebody had to build this.”TomoCredit has clearly struck a chord. Fintech generated more than $20 million in revenue last year, according to documents reviewed by CNBC.Kim, now 38, says she built TomoCredit for her younger self. “As someone who moved here alone, I didn’t know how important a borrowing history was. I want people, especially immigrants [to] feel empowered, instead of being ashamed, because not having a credit score ... was not something I should be ashamed about. That’s simply because I didn’t know the system,” said Kim.Her message: not having a credit score isn’t a personal failure. It’s the result of a system designed to exclude those without family ties, long borrowing histories, or co-signers.For those starting out, Kim offers two key pieces of advice:Kim’s journey from being a “credit ghost” to building a company that serves others like her reflects a broader truth: millions of people in America still struggle with access to the financial system.TomoCredit’s growth shows both the demand for new solutions and the opportunity for fintech to disrupt entrenched banking practices.For Kim, the mission is deeply personal. “Not having a credit score was never something to be ashamed of. I just didn’t know the system. Now, we’re making sure others don’t have to go through the same struggle.”","Kristy Kim is the co-founder of TomoCredit, a fintech startup that helps people build credit.

"US market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq hit records after $15 trillion rally, Russell 2000 outperforms; Trump signals progress on US-China trade deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-market-today-wall-street-heads-for-record-setting-week-sp-nasdaq-rise/articleshow/124000465.cms,"



Wall Street was on course to close another record-setting week on Friday adding $15 trillion in value, buoyed by optimism that the Federal Reserve will continue to ease interest rates to support the economy.By early afternoon, the S&P 500 was up 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 129 points or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.5%. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks also broke past its previous record from 2021, AP reported.The rally has been fuelled by expectations of further rate cuts after the Fed lowered interest rates for the first time this year on Wednesday. Investors hope easier borrowing conditions will cushion the economy amid slowing job growth and persistent inflation pressures.Corporate action also lent support. FedEx rose 3.2% after reporting stronger-than-expected revenue and profit, helped by its domestic package business. Gold miner Newmont climbed 4.1% after selling its stake in Canada’s Orla Mining for $439 million, extending a stellar year in which its stock has more than doubled as gold prices hit record highs.Gold prices have benefited from the prospect of lower rates, high inflation, and concerns that mounting US and global debt could undermine currency values.Among laggards, homebuilder Lennar dropped 3.9% after posting weaker revenue despite stronger profits. Executive Chairman Stuart Miller cited “the continued pressures of today’s housing market” and said the company had to offer bigger incentives to lure buyers, which weighed on average sales prices.Analysts said easier interest rates could revive housing demand, with mortgage rates already falling in anticipation of the Fed’s rate-cutting campaign. However, they cautioned that the rally in equities may be vulnerable if the Fed does not cut rates as aggressively as markets expect.Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week described the central bank’s task as “precarious,” warning that while inflation remains stubbornly high, the job market is losing steam. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which risk pushing prices higher in the short term, have added further uncertainty.Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, noted that equities could face turbulence as “the economy slows, tariff impacts arrive piecemeal and political uncertainties continue.”Overseas, European markets were mixed while Asia ended on a subdued note. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.6% after the Bank of Japan said it would sell part of its large stock fund holdings while keeping rates steady. Chinese indices closed mixed ahead of a phone call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which Trump later described as “productive.” The two leaders agreed to meet at a regional summit in South Korea at the end of October.In the bond market, Treasury yields were stable. The 10-year yield edged up to 4.13% from 4.11% late Thursday.","The S&P 500 was up 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 129 points and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.5%.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

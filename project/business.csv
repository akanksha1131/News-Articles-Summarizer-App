China's consumer prices fall for third month amid ongoing economic struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-for-third-month-amid-ongoing-economic-struggles/articleshow/121056800.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

Consumer prices in China fell for the third month in April as the country grapples with sluggish spending amid a fierce trade war with the United States.The latest data, released on Saturday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), showed that the consumer price index (CPI), a crucial inflation measure, dropped by 0.1 percent year-on-year. This marks a continuation of the downward trend observed in February and March, reflecting deep-rooted challenges for the world's second-largest economy.The world’s second largest economy has been struggling with deflationary pressures in recent years, facing longstanding woes in the property and exports sector.NBS statistician Dong Lijuan commented on the figures, attributing the decline to ""international imported factors"" which have led to lower prices in certain industries.These figures come at a critical time for the Asian giant, just ahead of key economic talks between officials from China and the United States in Switzerland. The two countries have been long engaged in a tit for tat tariff situation, with the US imposing a staggering 145% duty on many imports, which may reach as high as 245% overall.President Donald Trump had hinted on Friday that tariffs could be reduced to 80 percent, though Beijing has consistently called for a full cancellation of the levies that continue to pressurise the economy.Despite these external pressures, Chinese exports managed to rise in April, with a notable shift in trade routes to Southeast Asia. Exports to countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam saw double-digit growth, compensating for a sharp drop in exports to the United States.The producer price index (PPI), another key inflation indicator. also dropped by 2.7 percent year-on-year in April, a steeper decline than March's 2.5 percent drop. This further reflected broader challenges in China's manufacturing and export sectors.""Changes in the international trade environment and a rapid decline in some international bulk commodities have affected the decline in prices in related domestic industries,"" Dong said.According to trade figures from China's customs bureau, exports to the United States saw a major decline in April. However, shipments to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam, experienced double-digit growth.Chinese policymakers have recently relaxed key monetary policy measures, in efforts to stimulate domestic economic activity. These include cuts to a major interest rate and a reduction in the reserve requirements for banks, designed to encourage more lending.","Consumer prices in China fell for the third month in April as the country grapples with sluggish spending amid a fierce trade war with the United States.

The Indian pharmaceutical market continued rising in April 2025, achieving a strong annual growth of 7.8%, with total sales reaching a remarkable Rs 19,711 crore.According to a report by Pharmatrack, the sector recorded an impressive Rs 1,424 crore in additional sales this month, highlighting its continued resilience and strong demand.The report attributed the growth primarily to price-led expansion, as well as the impact of new product introductions (NIS). On a moving annual total (MAT) basis, the industry surged to Rs 2,27,361 crore, reflecting an 8.3 per cent increase year-on-year and a healthy 10.3 per cent Compound annual growth rate (CAGR). These figures highlight the sector’s long-term growth potential and strong position in the market.Therapeutic segments such as cardiac, neuro/CNS, blood-related, anti-neoplastics, ophthalmology/otology, and urology were major contributors to the momentum in April, as the importance of speciality and chronic therapies continues to grow, driving the market's expansion.Despite modest volume growth of just 0.4 per cent, the industry’s effective pricing strategies enabled it to manage cost pressures and maintain topline growth.Among the therapy areas, cardiac and anti-Infectives saw major volume boosts in April because of sustained demand in chronic disease management and acute care needs, respectively.The cardiac therapy segment, in particular, showed strong performance, driven by continuous demand for anti-hypertensives, lipid lowering agents, and heart failure therapies. Meanwhile, the anti-infectives sector rose from seasonal infections and localised outbreaks, leading to a noticeable volume surge.From a pricing perspective, Respiratory therapy led the charge with a 6.6 per cent price increase, followed by Cardiac and Gastrointestinal therapies, reflecting pricing dynamics in high-demand categories.The report also highlighted the success of stomatologicals, which emerged as a standout in new product performance, registering a 7.7 per cent growth. This growth was largely driven by launches in specialised care areas where competition remains relatively low and demand is evolving.","Indian pharmaceutical market continued rising in April 2025, achieving a strong annual growth of 7.8%.

Those dropping from HV3 to HV2 will still receive 20%.

Employees with three straight years of Top Tier will receive 105% of their pay band.

Amazon is changing how it pays employees, focusing more on consistent top performance over time rather than one-time achievements.The new pay structure aims to reward employees who consistently perform at a high level and to reduce bonuses for those with less consistent records.According to an Amazon spokesperson, the new framework ""better distinguishes between newer high performers and those who have consistently exceeded expectations for their role and level.""Starting in 2025, employees who have received the company's highest performance rating, ""Top Tier,"" for four straight years will get 110% of their pay band, up from the previous maximum of 100%, according to internal reports obtained by the Business Insider.However, first-time Top Tier performers will see a drop in their bonus from 80% of their pay range to 70%.

The recent announcement of India UK FTA is new in the series of bilateral FTAs negotiated in the recent past – starting with Australia, followed by UAE and EFTA countries (Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland). It demonstrates a very deliberate and sure-footed approach of expanding India’s FTA footprint for gaining market access for goods of Indian origin and opening new avenues of growth and international cooperation. It’s the joint success story of India’s Trade & Foreign Policy Successful negotiation of the FTA with the UK – till most recently being part of the EU, also bodes well for the progress that India will be able to make with EU FTA negotiations which have been waiting for a decisive push after the past thirteen years of negotiations.India EU FTA has been held back on issues like unconditional market access to European luxury car manufacturers at concessional rate of duty, better access to alco-beverage sector and need for data secure status for India.As is evident from the PIB press release issued on May 6, some of the long standing, contentious issues, which have been holding back the India EU negotiations have been successfully addressed in the India UK FTA.Illustratively progressive reduction in duty rates on import of completely built-up cars from the UK over a period of ten years, subject to the upper limit on the number of cars that can be imported in a year.This quota-based access to luxury or fully built up cars under the FTA is a unique solution which balances out the opposite policy pull of granting market access but without adversely impacting the domestic industry. Simultaneous reduction in duty on cars and implementing annual limits to complete built-up cars is a balanced solution.We have seen this position playing out even in case of reduction in basic customs duty rate on import of superbikes about 1600 cc of engine capacity, or in case of EV policy allowing access to a certain number of complete built up EVs subject to an investment commitment.Also, reduction in duty rates on import of whiskey was another long-standing issue which seems to be resolved not only under India UK FTA but also when India unilaterally announced reduction in the duty rate on Bourbon whiskey of US origin.All these developments are a good omen for a positive outcome in India EU FTA. EU is India’s second largest trading partner and FTA with EU would be a powerful foreign policy win for the government.The initial sound bites on the impact of India UK FTA are very encouraging but fine prints of the agreement are yet to be analyzed. Open questions are how many cars are to be allowed to be imported annually; how will the origin of such cars be established; how would the licensing and control be put in place; whether DGFT will be the nodal agency for granting and monitoring of annual quota; whether the quota will be issued on the name of company. There are many such questions which would require an answer.This newfound flexibility and decisiveness demonstrated by the government in finding win-win solutions to long pending issues is a welcome development which would open the doors of fresh economic activity which could continue to drive growth in GDP and better relationships with partner countries. And the timing of the India UK FTA can’t be better when India is also expecting to close the bilateral trade discussions with the US government. Signing of a series of new FTAs underline the success of India’s foreign policy and trade policy working together.",India UK FTA is new in the series of bilateral FTAs negotiated in the recent past.

Global central banks stock up gold

RBI has been on a gold buying spree, but it’s not alone! Several countries besides India are increasing their gold holdings significantly. Among countries that witnessed the most substantial increase in gold's proportion of their total foreign exchange reserves between 2009 and 2024, Russia, Egypt, Argentina, Poland, and Libya lead the pack.Globally, central banks' collective gold holdings grew from 26,000 tonnes to 32,000 tonnes during the 15-year period ending 2024, showing a compounded annual growth rate of 4.1%.Central banks acquire gold as a strategy to diversify their foreign exchange holdings and protect against inflation and currency value changes. Experts indicate that it serves as a reliable asset during periods of global uncertainty and political instability.These acquisitions have grown following the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly due to increased geopolitical tensions and border disputes.According to an ET report, these countries saw an expansion in gold reserves ranging from 800 to 2,700 basis points within their foreign exchange holdings. A basis point equals 0.01 percentage point.India's gold holdings as a percentage of forex reserves increased by 450 basis points, rising from 6.9% to 11.4%, according to World Gold Council data.It's important to note that these proportions require careful analysis, as increases might result from decreased forex reserves rather than actual growth in gold holdings.According to a Bank of Baroda analysis, the United States, Germany, Italy, France, Switzerland, Japan, Netherlands, China, Russia, and India represent the top 10 gold-holding nations. Collectively, they possess approximately 76% of all central bank gold holdings in 2024. This percentage has decreased from 81% in 2009, as developed nations have maintained relatively stable gold reserves.Also Read | India has the world's 7th highest gold reserves! Why is RBI buying gold and how does it help the Indian economy? The United States maintains the largest gold reserves at 8,133 tonnes, which has remained constant over the past 15 years.

Foreign currency assets , the largest component of India’s forex reserves rose slightly by $514 million to $581.18 billion.These assets reflect the value of major global currencies such as the euro, pound sterling, and Japanese yen, and are expressed in US dollar terms.However, the rise in foreign currency assets was offset by a $2.55 million drop in gold reserves, which fell to $81.82 billion.SDRs or special drawing rights, which are kept with the IMF, also slipped by $30 million reaching $18.56 billion.The central bank also estimated that the reserves are sufficient to cover projected imports for almost 10-12 months.The current movement follows a pattern seen since September, when reserves had peaked at a record high of $704.89 billion before gradually falling, likely due to the RBI's interventions in the forex market aimed at curbing volatility and defending the Rupee, which remains near its historic lows against the US dollar.The central bank continues to manage liquidity in the currency markets by selling dollars during periods of Rupee weakness and accumulating reserves when the currency is strong.Last year, forex reserves added more than $20 billion. In 2023, the forex kitty soared by almost $58 billion, a sharp reversal from the $71 billion decline recorded in 2022.These foreign exchange reserves are held by a country’s national bank, in mostly reserve currencies like US dollar, with smaller portions in Euro, Yen and Pound Sterling.","The fall brings India’s total forex reserves down to $686.06 billion, after they had surged $1.98 billion to $688.13 billion in the week ending 25 April.

India registered a formal protest, citing Pakistan’s poor track record with IMF reforms and expressing fears of fund diversion. New Delhi abstained from the vote.“Rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism sends a dangerous message,” the finance ministry said in a statement.“It exposes funding agencies and donors to reputational risks and undermines global values.”Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the development, describing it as a “defeat of India’s high-handed tactics” and a sign of international confidence in Pakistan’s economic recovery. “Indian attempts to sabotage the IMF programme have failed,” the Pak's PMO said, accusing India of plotting “a conspiracy to divert attention” through “unilateral aggression.”The new disbursement brings total IMF funding to Pakistan under the EFF to around $2 billion. The full $7 billion package, agreed in July last year, is structured over 39 months in seven instalments, contingent on successful reforms including tax restructuring, energy sector reforms, and pricing adjustments in utilities and industries.The IMF and Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement in March on the first biannual review, which included commitments such as the introduction of a carbon levy and tariff revisions.","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday approved the immediate disbursement of $1 billion to Pakistan.

US stocks are drifting Friday as Wall Street heads toward the end of an unusually quiet week.The S&P 500 was up 0.4 percent in morning trading and on track to erase what had been a small loss for the week. This may be the first week in seven where the index at the heart of many 401(k) accounts moves by less than 1.5 per cent, after swinging sharply first on fears about President Donald Trump's trade war and then on hopes that he'll relent on some of his tariffs.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 86 points, or 0.2 per cent, as of 10 am Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6 per cent higher.The big event for the week is likely coming on Saturday, when trading will be closed in financial markets. That's when high-level US and Chinese officials will be meeting in Switzerland for their first talks since Trump launched an escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies.The fear among investors and economists is that a recession could hit if the United States doesn't reach trade deals that lower tariffs by enough and quickly enough.Trump on Friday floated the idea of bringing tariffs on Chinese imports down to 80 per cent from their current 145 per cent rate, but he said it'll be up to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who will be in Switzerland. While that would indeed be a reduction, it would still be high, and Trump's posting on social media caused a brief jolt in financial markets.Futures for US stocks sank immediately.But markets later calmed as the wait continued for what US and Chinese officials will say after their meeting.Trump also talked up the potential for more trade deals that could be on the way, following his announcement the day before on an agreement with the United Kingdom.""Many Trade Deals in the hopper, all good (GREAT!) ones!"" he said on his Truth Social network.In the meantime, the flow of earnings reports for the start of the year from companies is slowing but still moving the market.Lyft rallied 20.3 per cent after delivering a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though its revenue fell short. The company said it reached the highest weekly ridership levels in its history during the last week of March.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the chip giant known as TSMC, offered an encouraging report after saying its revenue in April leaped 48.1 per cent from a year earlier. That sent its stock that trades in the United States up 1.8 per cent.Insulet jumped 15.8 per cent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after the medical device company reported stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which sells tubeless insulin pump technology, also raised its forecast for an underlying revenue trend for the full year.They helped offset a 7.5 per cent drop for Expedia. The travel website, which owns Vrbo and Hotels.com, reported a stronger profit than analysts expected, but it also said demand was weaker than it expected during the quarter. It highlighted softer-than-expected demand in the United States, as well as a nearly 30 per cent decline in bookings from Canada to its southern neighbor.Other travel-related companies, including Hilton and Airbnb, have reported a similar softening in travel demand to the US in their recent earnings reports.In stock markets abroad, indexes were higher in Europe after finishing mixed in Asia.Stocks rose 0.4 per cent in Hong Kong but fell 0.3 per cent in Shanghai after China reported that its exports rose at a faster-than-expected 8.1 per cent annual pace in April. Exports to the United States dropped more than 20 per cent, however, as Trump's steep tariff increases took effect.

The deal was revealed by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick during the signing of a bilateral trade agreement between the US and the UK.The aircraft deal is expected to be led by International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, and Aer Lingus. As per industry sources IAG plans to order around 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and a similar number of long-haul jets from Airbus, including the A350 and A330neo, in a carefully balanced fleet expansion.“It’s a split order,” a source told Reuters.Though the announcement was made by the US government, Lutnick held back from revealing more details, saying he would let the airlines make the announcement themselves.More details are expected when IAG releases its quarterly earnings report on Friday.This new order will add to Boeing’s existing backlog, which already includes 149 aircraft ordered by UK-based buyers, 109 from airlines and 40 from a leasing company, valued at over $12 billion before discounts.Bloomberg News reported that apart from the 30 planes, IAG could also negotiate options for further purchases.Boeing is currently working to boost production of its best-selling 737 MAX to 38 jets per month, following a turbulent year that saw quality issues and a change in leadership.This high-stakes order also comes at a time of heightened trade tensions between the US and the EU, as the union had previously threatened to impose tariffs on Boeing planes if broader negotiations with Washington failed.","The deal is expected to be led by International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, and Aer Lingus.

Imports, meanwhile, dipped slightly by 0.2% year-on-year, though they rose nearly 4% from March.Officials released these figures on Friday before scheduled discussions between the two economic powerhouses. Analysts suggest this unexpected rise reflects Beijing's strategy to redirect trade towards Southeast Asian nations to counter US tariffs reaching 145 percent imposed by President Donald Trump.Commercial activity between these leading economies has declined following Trump's implementation of tariffs, some reaching 245 percent, whilst China countered with 125 percent duties and additional measures.The April year-on-year export growth of 8.1 percent significantly exceeded Bloomberg analysts' predictions of 2.0 percent.Chinese customs data revealed substantial increases in exports to Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, indicating a significant shift in trade patterns.""The global supply chain is being rerouted in real time,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management wrote in a note.""Vietnam looks set to become China's offshore escape hatch for US-facing goods,"" he said.""The manufacturing juggernaut is diverting flow wherever the tariff pain isn't.""US-bound exports decreased by 17.6 percent month-on-month.Financial markets have fluctuated since the White House initiated its tariff strategy, aimed at revitalising US manufacturing. Although Trump suspended numerous severe tariffs for 90 days, those affecting China remain active.Market sentiment improved due to scheduled Geneva discussions between US and Chinese representatives, marking the first diplomatic engagement since the trade disputes began.US officials express hope for reduced tensions, while Chinese authorities maintain their commitment to protecting national interests.Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, attributes the strong export figures to ""transshipment through other countries.""He also noted possible ""trade contracts that were signed before the tariffs were announced.""""I expect trade data will weaken in the next few months.""Import figures, a crucial indicator of Chinese consumer demand, also surpassed expectations with a mere 0.2 percent decline, compared to projected 6.0 percent decrease.Chinese authorities implemented monetary policy adjustments this week to stimulate domestic activity, including interest rate reductions and lower bank reserve requirements to encourage lending.The ongoing property sector crisis continues to affect economic growth.To support the sector, Pan announced a reduction in first-time home purchase rates for loans exceeding five years to 2.6 percent from 2.85 percent.These measures represent China's most comprehensive economic interventions since September.However, analysts note insufficient stimulus funding for economic recovery, complicated by trade tensions with Washington.""Even if the tariffs may be trimmed depending on the outcome of US-China trade talks, the persisting uncertainties will continue to accelerate decoupling structurally,"" Gary Ng, senior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, told AFP.","China's exports surged 8.1% annually in April, even surpassing economists' expectations of just 2%.

Gates told the New York Times that Musk's severe cuts to the US Agency for International Development were linked to a missed social engagement, appearing to criticise Musk's conduct.""People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them,"" Gates wrote, sharing a chart predicting his net worth will drop by 99% over the next two decades, reflecting a doubling of his philanthropic pace.Citing inspiration from 19th-century philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, Gates clarified he does not want to create a foundation that lasts forever. Gates expressed preference for swift distribution of billions rather than establishing a permanent foundation, citing emerging technologies' potential.Whilst acknowledging private foundations' impact, Gates stressed governmental roles' importance, lamenting significant budget reductions by various wealthy nations.""It's unclear whether the world's richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people. But the one thing we can guarantee is that, in all of our work, the Gates Foundation will support efforts to help people and countries pull themselves out of poverty,"" he wrote.These changes included Musk's ""Department of Government Efficiency"" severely cutting USAID during Trump's presidency.Gates described these reductions as ""stunning"" and more extensive than anticipated.

The reading came in below economists’ expectations of 230,000, based on a Reuters poll, and reversed some of the prior week’s spike attributed to school spring breaks in New York state.While the weekly drop reflects a still-sturdy job market, economists are increasingly wary of a potential slowdown ahead.President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff hikes—including a 145% duty on Chinese imports—have rattled both business and consumer sentiment, adding pressure to an economy already navigating inflation concerns and slower hiring momentum.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, speaking after the central bank kept interest rates steady at 4.25–4.50% on Wednesday, warned that the scale of tariff increases has been ""significantly larger than anticipated.""He added, “If sustained, they’re likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth and an increase in unemployment.”Despite those concerns, employers appear hesitant to shed workers. Many firms, having struggled to hire during and after the pandemic, remain reluctant to let go of existing employees. However, businesses directly exposed to trade risks have begun modest layoffs, hinting at deeper challenges.A recent ISM manufacturing survey highlighted that employment in the sector remained weak in April, with layoffs noted as the primary adjustment tool—an indication that job cuts are becoming more deliberate.The number of people receiving benefits after their initial claim—a proxy for ongoing hiring—fell by 29,000 to 1.879 million in the week ending April 26. However, other labour indicators flashed concern: while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2% in April, the median duration of unemployment rose to 10.4 weeks, up from 9.8 weeks in March.The economy added 177,000 jobs in April, showing moderate job creation but suggesting that hiring momentum may be slowing as businesses grow more cautious amid global trade tensions and monetary policy uncertainty.","Initial jobless claims dropped by 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 228,000 for the week ending May 3.

Menon is also reportedly stepping down as the chairman of Tesla India’s board.Tesla, led by CEO Elon Musk, has been eyeing an India entry for years, and the recent developments suggest that the company is finally putting pieces in place. Despite the leadership shake-up, Tesla appears to be pushing ahead with its plans, having secured retail showroom locations and posted close to two dozen job openings in India.These include roles in store management, service operations, and customer relations—clear indicators of an impending launch.The timing of Menon’s exit coincides with ongoing trade talks between India and the US, which could lead to a lowering of auto import tariffs.

"What Warren Buffett, world’s 5th richest person, has to say about choosing the right life partner to succeed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/what-warren-buffett-worlds-5th-richest-person-has-to-say-about-choosing-the-right-life-partner-to-succeed/articleshow/121001274.cms,"Warren Buffett

Famous investor and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett announced that he will step down as CEO by the end of this year, with Vice Chairman Greg Abel set to succeed him. Buffett, 94, made the announcement during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting, adding that he will not sell a single share of Berkshire stock.Buffett's decision comes amid a lifetime of leadership at Berkshire Hathaway, where he transformed a struggling textile mill into one of the world’s most valuable conglomerates. He is widely regarded not only for his investment acumen but also for his personal integrity and long-term thinking.In reflecting on his journey, Buffett has often credited his late wife, Susan Buffett , as the most important influence in his life and success, according to an ET report.“What happened with me would not have happened without her,” Buffett said in HBO’s 2017 documentary Becoming Warren Buffett. The couple married in 1952 and had three children—Susie, Howard, and Peter—before Susan’s death in 2004 from a cerebral haemorrhage.Buffett has repeatedly emphasized the importance of choosing the right life partner. “Marry the right person. I’m serious about that,” he said during a 2009 Berkshire annual meeting.“It will make more difference in your life. It will change your aspirations, all kinds of things.”In a 2017 conversation with Bill Gates, Buffett echoed that sentiment: “You want to associate with people who are the kind of person you’d like to be. You’ll move in that direction. And the most important person by far in that respect is your spouse.”Buffett’s unique personal life has drawn attention over the years. Despite being married to Susan until her death, he fell in love with Astrid Menks, whom Susan had befriended and later introduced to Warren. Despite their physical separation, with Susan residing on the West Coast, they maintained their marriage and remained deeply connected to one another. After Susan moved to San Francisco, she asked Astrid, then working at a local restaurant, to help look after Warren. Astrid later became Buffett’s long-time companion and second wife.“She is a very helping, giving person,” Susan told Charlie Rose in a 2004 interview, explaining how Astrid came to care for Buffett. “She’s really a good soul.”Buffett's legacy as one of the most influential investors in history is tightly interwoven with both his professional brilliance and deeply personal relationships—especially with Susan, whom he often described as the second of only two major turning points in his life. The first, he says, was being born.As Buffett prepares to hand over the reins of Berkshire Hathaway to Greg Abel, his advice to future generations remains grounded in humility: choose the right people, both in life and business.","Buffett, 94, made the announcement during Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

Indian companies and Chinese part makers are negotiating to lower prices by up to 5%. (AI image)

Pumping up production

Chinese electronics component makers are offering price reductions of up to 5% to Indian companies as part of new sourcing contract negotiations, driven by concerns over the US trade conflict. US President Donald Trump has slapped a whopping 125% tariff on Chinese goods after China announced retaliatory tariffs.The US-China trade dispute has considerably reduced new orders to Chinese manufacturers, as global supply networks adjust to reciprocal tariffs, with the US imposing the highest rate of 125% on Chinese goods. The decreased American demand for Chinese electronics will also affect component requirements.The discounts being offered by Chinese companies are a substantial concession in an industry with slim 4-7% profit margins, according to an ET report. This could potentially allow Indian manufacturers to increase their profits by 2-3%, according to television, refrigerator and smartphone producers. Indian companies might transfer some cost benefits to customers to enhance sales.Chinese imports constitute approximately 75% of all electronics components used in Indian manufacturing.""Component manufacturers in China are under pressure,"" said Kamal Nandi, head of the appliance business at Godrej Enterprises Group. ""Prices will be renegotiated as export orders from the US slow down.""The electronics sector typically maintains raw material stocks for two to three months. Companies will initiate new orders from May-June onwards. According to a recent GTRI report, India's electronics component imports in FY24 increased by 36.7% to $34.4 billion compared to the previous year. Over five years, imports grew by 118.2% from $15.8 billion in FY19.Also Read | Apple looks to manufacture more iPhones in India as Trump’s tariffs hit China harder: Report Chinese manufacturers are experiencing surplus issues, according to Avneet Singh Marwah, chief executive of television contract manufacturer Super Plastronics.""There is panic. US export shipments from China are on hold. Indian companies and Chinese part makers are negotiating to lower prices by up to 5%,"" said Marwah, who has the India licence for Kodak, Thomson and Blaupunkt. ""However, since domestic demand in India is not robust, companies may pass some as discounts."" In 2024, electrical and electronic equipment represented the largest segment of US imports from China, amounting to $127.06 billion.Chinese suppliers are encountering reduced demand in India due to production-linked incentives, quality control orders (QCOs) requiring Bureau of Indian Standards approval for overseas sourcing, and increasing import duties on components, which have promoted local manufacturing. The India Cellular and Electronics Association projects domestic components and sub-assembly manufacturing to reach $145-155 billion by 2030, following the government's announcement of the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme on Tuesday. Currently, India imports essential electronic components including chips, compressors, inner grooved copper tubes, open cell television panels, printed circuit boards, battery cells, display modules, camera modules and flexible printed circuits.Also Read | 'I am not Sanjay of Mahabharata': RBI governor on where repo rate will head amidst Trump's tariff wars Dixon Technologies' managing director Atul Lall indicates that US market slowdown and reduced demand will result in lower component prices.

Counterpoint Research director Tarun Pathak notes that smartphone component prices will decrease due to excess supply, though not all components are interchangeable.""Brands may partly pass it on or absorb it, depending on inventory position. Almost 75% of the smartphone components used in India are imported from China,"" Pathak said.",US President Donald Trump has slapped a whopping 125% tariff on Chinese goods.

This in turn also pushed the price of the yellow metal in the domestic market a step closer to the psychologically important Rs 1 lakh/10-gram mark, to Rs 96,000 by Friday evening, a new all-time peak.The recent surge in the yellow metal in the global and local markets came on the back of a sharp drop after the US president Donald Trump escalated the tariff war with most of the country's trading partners, raising chances of a recession in the US. In the domestic market gold prices had fallen to Rs 88,200 on Tuesday while in the international market it had dipped below the $3,000 mark.In Friday's mid-session on Comex in the US, gold prices had hit a new all-time high at $3,262. The recent recovery in gold prices was driven by renewed demand for safe haven following Trump's erratic remarks on tariffs, that led to a huge sell-off in global equity and bond markets, weakened the dollar, and raised fears of a global recession, said Saumil Gandhi, senior analyst - commodities, HDFC Securities.

RBI proposes new route for offloading bad loans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-proposes-new-route-for-offloading-bad-loans/articleshow/120217704.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI has proposed a new route for banks and NBFCs to offload bad loans, allowing them to bundle and sell stressed assets directly to investors through special purpose entities set up by regulated financial firms. Until now, only asset reconstruction companies handled such assets. The move, announced with the April monetary policy, is intended to broaden the market for distressed debt and reduce dependence on ARCs.A key feature is the appointment of resolution managers, tasked with recovering value from the underlying assets. These must be independent of the originating lender. For such loans, RBI-regulated entities can act as resolution managers. For others, insolvency professionals and regulated institutions may qualify. Lenders must gradually provision for the securitised notes over five years. Capital requirements vary with recovery ratings, favoring senior tranches. Any exposure left after five years is to be marked down to Re 1.With the new dispensation, ARCs may lose some of their market. Larger cases are presently going to the NARCL, and the new framework will now allow lenders to bypass ARCs for mid-sized and retail loans. RBI has also mandated that ARCs must raise their net owned fund to Rs 300 crore by FY26, a threshold many have yet to meet. The new framework retains a key principle of RBI's regulations on bad loans that are aimed at preventing defaulters getting control of their assets through the back door.","Until now, only asset reconstruction companies handled such assets.

Sebi chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey

TOI’s Surojit Gupta & Sidhartha, Pandey

What are your priority areas?

In a sense, you are promoting ease of doing business?

Markets are very volatile now. How do you assure the investor community that Indian markets are safe?

Have you increased surveillance in

the market, amid what’s happening around the globe?

What is the state of play on IPOs? Do you see some slowing down because of the volatility?

What is the progress on a common KYC across the financial sector?

What is the position on allowing foreign individuals to invest directly in Indian stock markets?

What is your view on overseas listing of Indian companies?

Does Sebi need to do more on communication with the market?

There is also a lot of misinformation. Are you planning a fact check?

Are you looking at promoting new kinds of futures such as energy futures? Agricultural futures have been a no-go area. Will you review that?

India has moved forward and

introduced a T+0 for a select number of stocks. What is the roadmap?

How much of a challenge do you think the new technology, such AI, is for capital markets?

One of the irritants for people is the IEPF (Investor Education and Protection Fund) guidelines. There are a lot of complaints that people are not able to get their genuine claims settled…

What are the other measures that the regulator is contemplating to make the market more secure for a new retrail investor?

is a little over a month into his job and has undertaken several measures to ensure more trust in the stock market regulator. In an interview totalks about a range of issues and assures investors that the Indian markets are safe against the backdrop of volatility triggered by global events. Excerpts...We have got three mandates, which are investment protection, development of markets and regulation of markets. Four elements that we will bring in are trust, transparency, technology and teamwork. On trust, it will be people’s trust in Sebi and Sebi’s trust of its ecosystem, both need to be promoted. Conflict of interest norms also need to be updated, for which we have set up a committee and that will give us a lot of guidance on how we put our framework. Another issue on trust is how we are going to make our regulations.Regulations should be optimum, which are risk-based. If you have a higher amount of risk, there should be a higher scrutiny, if there is low amount of risk or something which need not be micromanaged, in that case, we should not get into that.So that balancing is required. We also need to look at some of the past regulations. Whether in a particular context they may have been necessary, but now context may have changed, or technology has worked out, or the system has improved and therefore that kind of micromanagement may not be contextually necessary. In that case, we should eliminate them. Every department is being asked to look at their regulations and work with stakeholders to identify what are the points that can be simplified.Yes, ease of doing business combined with ensuring that market integrity is maintained at all times, and investors are duly protected. With the development of the market, there are new products, the Indian capital market is growing rapidly. It has to have all elements. It has to have different types of risks. There are different diversifications, which are already there. There are different possibilities in the futures market, such as energy futures.Our payment and settlement systems are very robust. The possibil ity of any default is not there. The contracts will be honoured. People can enter and exit without difficulty. When we are interacting with other market participants, FIIs and other investors, they have a lot of trust in our institutions, in our ability to handle. Indian systems are some of the most modern in the world, most secure in the world. From 2019 to 2024, the CAGR in India was 8.5% in dollar terms. In this period it was zero for emerging market and minus 3% for China.From the 1990s, when FIIs were allowed, the markets have consistently given double-digit returns in dollar terms. These markets have developed over a period of time. We are estimating 6.5% GDP growth and the fundamentals are strong. The budget has offered incentives, which will boost domestic consumption and RBI ’s policy has been supportive and accommodative. Headwinds are there, no doubt. But India may offer some opportunities too, relatively speaking.We are always on 24x7 surveillance. Sebi in coordination with exchanges is constantly watching the situation. And, we had, even the worst days when you had a sharp fall, we did have an impact. Relative to the rest of the world, India was much less affected.There were some concerns around some of the small IPOs seeing massive subscriptions.On the SME IPO issue, there have been changes by Sebi and certain regulatory measures have been brought in. On the main board, IPOs have gone up. India had the largest number of IPOs. In contrast, there are markets where IPOs have not been possible for the whole year.There is good progress there. Both Sebi and RBI have to work together and there are certain points that need to be ironed out, which we should be able to do soon.There is some discussion happening. The department of economic affairs is undertaking a review of Fema rules. One of them relates to NRIs and there is a limit of 5% that they are thinking of raising it to 10% and the overall to 24%. Then, there is the idea that investors could be directly asked to do that. But we still have to examine and deliberate. There is discussion on how the KYC will be done, what the implications will be and so on. Right now, individuals can come, but they have to come through FIIs or through a fund.On the contrary, there are a lot of companies that want to list in India and we should welcome that. We will facilitate it. We are here to develop our capital market. Reverse flipping is taking place.We have been communicating. We put a lot of things on the website and Sebi has very good practices. We must appreciate that they have been developed over a period of time and successive leadership in Sebi has honed up this place, they have nurtured it. The institution has come up, faced many challenges and also improved. Obviously, we have to constantly be on the move because no complacency is acceptable. One piece which was missing, we didn’t have a very active social media presence and we have recently unveiled it.We immediately get into areas where some false online platform is there and there are attempts to swindle the money in the name of investment, including through cyber frauds. Then, there is also the issue of fin-fluencers. We have taken down something like 70,000 fin-fluencers from YouTube with the help of Meta and Google. At the same time, we also want more of the industry to develop and have registered entities.We will be making progress around that (energy futures) because a lot of things have been developed and a lot of regulatory hurdles have been crossed. Soon you should be seeing that. About agriculture, some of the important products are not available. That is something which is hampering the industry. But that’s a policy call, which has to be taken by govt.If you ask me, T+1 is good enough.AI has to be looked at from both sides. It has enormous potential. For example, Sebi itself uses a lot of AI tools and going forward, we would like to use this in all areas of our work. But AI also has certain other points, which are risks. So, we also need to evolve a risk mitigation strategy.Proactive efforts should be made so that it doesn’t have to go to IEPF. Sebi will really explore. We will facilitate use of registered transfer agents by IEPF for processing. We will help them to process any claim. Then in next two months we will conduct Niveshak Shivirs in Mumbai and Gujarat jointly with ministry of corporate affairs, where we will get top corporate RTAs where we have a large IEPF outstanding. They have ledgers and the companies are making efforts.We need to increase investor awareness. People coming to the stock market is a welcome thing. After all, you have to deploy your savings. The most important thing is that people should not be borrowing to invest. This is an issue where sometimes you do learn by some sagacious advice from your friends and relatives. Sometimes, you get lured into some riskier ventures on the advice of some of your sagacious peers. Then sometimes you lose money.The point is that it’s like a behavioural issue. And in behaviour, you can have an awareness element. We would like to up that awareness element. Mutual fund industry is doing its own awareness drives. So, everybody doesn’t get into very risky things. Because some of the people can get attracted to very abnormal gains, which some listed companies might show. On the awareness part, we would like to upscale our efforts more together as an ecosystem. Ideally, we should also collaborate with other regulators and work together for financial awareness of a higher order.","Will bring in four elements of trust, transparency, technology and teamwork under triple mandate of investment protection, development of markets and regulation of markets.

RBI to infuse Rs 40k crore into banking system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-to-infuse-rs-40k-crore-into-banking-system/articleshow/120217483.cms,"MUMBAI: The RBI on Friday said it will buy govt securities of various maturities aggregating Rs 40,000 crore on April 17. This will be the third open market operation (OMO) purchase of gilts by the central bank in the current fiscal. The first one of Rs 20,000 crore was conducted on April 3 while the second one, of the same amount, was on April 8.The OMO purchases are in line with the central bank's stated policy of infusing liquidity to the tune of 1% of the net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in the banking system, a debt fund manager said. Currently, the NDTL of the banking system is about Rs 250 lakh crore. So, the expected liquidity infusion would be about Rs 2.5 lakh crore, fund managers said.Since Jan 2025, the central bank has infused liquidity worth nearly Rs 7 lakh crore into the banking system, official data showed. Along with liquidity infusion, there were two rate cuts by the RBI, one each in Feb and April. The combined effect has been about 20-25 basis points fall in benchmark yield on 10-year gilts to around 6.5% level now. This, in turn, has also brought down interest rates on loans by banks and NBFCs.Lately, the central bank has changed the way it would measure liquidity in the banking system. It said that from now on it would consider system liquidity for infusing funds into the banking system, rather than durable liquidity which was the benchmark earlier.The latter, in addition to liquidity in the banking system, also takes into account the cash balance with the govt which could be spent any time, thus infusing liquidity into the banking system. In contrast, system liquidity considers only the funds available in the banking system, and thus is usually equal or less than durable liquidity.","This will be the third open market operation (OMO) purchase of gilts by the central bank in the current fiscal.

Investors dumped US government bonds, the dollar tumbled and stocks seesawed Friday, capping a volatile week as President Donald Trump 's unpredictable tariff policy rattled market confidence.Trump triggered a massive market sell-off last week by announcing universal tariffs, and this week he sparked a huge but short-lived rally by pausing higher duties against scores of countries.But he kept China in his crosshairs, hitting Chinese goods with a 145 percent tariff.Beijing said Friday that it would hit back with 125 percent duties on American products, but suggested it would not retaliate further in the future.Wall Street indexes opened in the red Friday but rose shortly thereafter as investors sought to make sense of the latest trade war news, with the broad-based S&P 500 edging up 0.3 percent around midday.European markets also had a roller-coaster trading day, with Frankfurt closing 0.9 percent lower and Paris down 0.3 percent. London rose 0.6 as data showed the UK economy grew far more than expected in February.""The main driver of the renewed market pressure was an increased focus on the US-China escalation,"" said Jim Reid, managing director at Deutsche Bank.""Neither the US nor China are showing signs of backing down, with President Trump expressing confidence in his tariff plans,"" Reid said.The dollar plunged to its lowest level against the euro in more than three years as investors fled what is typically considered a key haven currency, though it later pared some of its losses.In a more worrying sign of cracking investor confidence in the US economy, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bill rose sharply to 4.5 percent as its price tumbled.John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said it was a sign of ""concern that China might dump its vast holdings of Treasuries"" even if that risked losses for Beijing and driving the yuan higher against the dollar.With Treasuries being sold off, sending their yields higher and making US debt more expensive, there is a fear of a bigger exodus from American assets down the line.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Friday rejected the notion that US Treasuries were no longer a haven.""If you're going to invest your money in something, America is still a pretty, pretty good place in this turbulent world,"" Dimon said in a conference call after his bank reported hefty first-quarter profits and revenue.The weaker dollar and the rush for safety sent gold to a record high above $3,220 an ounce.Oil prices rose slightly after huge falls on Thursday.""There remains considerable uncertainty around the impact of tariffs on economies and company earnings, and that could keep markets volatile for some time,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.Investors were also turning to more routine economic and business data, with the release of inflation data and corporate earnings.Official figures showed US producer inflation fell sharply last month before the tariffs took effect.JPMorgan Chase reported first-quarter profits of $14.6 billion, up nine percent from the period last year.In Asia, the Tokyo stock market shed three percent -- a day after surging more than nine percent -- while Sydney and Seoul were also in the red.Hong Kong and Shanghai rose as traders focused on possible Chinese stimulus measures.There were gains in Taipei and Ho Chi Minh City stocks as the leaders of Taiwan and Vietnam said they would hold talks with Trump.","Dollar plunges to its lowest level against the euro in more than three years as investors flee what is typically considered a key haven currency.

But President Donald Trump's trade wars cloud the outlook.The Labour Department said Friday that its producer price index - which tracks inflation before it hits consumers - fell 0.4% from February, first drop since October 2023. Compared with a year earlier, producer prices rose 2.7%, down from a 3.2% year-over-year gain in February and much lower than the 3.3% economists had forecast. Gasoline prices fell 11.1% from February and egg prices, which had skyrocketed because of bird flu, plummeted 21.3%.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core wholesale inflation fell 0.1% from February, the first drop since July. Compared to a year earlier, core producer prices were up 3.3% and lower than economists had forecast.The report comes a day after the Labour Department delivered good news on inflation at the consumer level. Its consumer price index rose just 2.4% last month from March 2024, the smallest year-over-year gain since September. Core consumer prices posted the smallest year-over-year increase in nearly four years.The inflation outlook is muddied by Trump's trade wars. He's imposing a 145% tax - a tariff - on Chinese imports and is hitting most of the rest of the world's imports with a 10% levy that might go up after 90 days.The trade barriers are widely expected to raise prices as importers attempt to pass along their higher costs.","The Labour Department said Friday that its producer price index - which tracks inflation before it hits consumers - fell 0.4% from February.

Managed revenue also surpassed projections of $44 billion, standing at $46 billion, up from $41.9 billion last year.CEO Jamie Dimon credited a strong performance from the bank’s markets division for the solid quarter.However, he also raised concerns over the ongoing trade tensions for both the bank and the economy.Dimon warned of rising global uncertainties and added trade tensions to his list of potential negatives facing the bank and broader economy.Trump’s unpredictable tariff hikes, currently up 10 per cent for most US trading partners and 145 per cent for China, triggered weeks of market turbulence, fuelling uncertainty over the direction of the global economy. Such instability poses a challenge for banks, which depend on steady markets and confident borrowers.Despite the uncertainty, JPMorgan’s trading desk flourished in early 2025, boosted by market volatility that started even before the administration introduced its major “Liberation Day” tariffs on 2 April.The bank’s markets revenue jumped 21 per cent, while equities trading surged 48 per cent year-on-year. Consumer and community banking also saw a 4 per cent rise in revenue to $18.3 billion.On China, which has retaliated with 125 per cent tariffs on US imports, JPMorgan executives said it was too early to predict any long-term impact. “We really have to see how things play out,” said CFO Jeremy Barnum. “In the near term, that business is performing fine and we are not seeing any effect.”The bank set aside $3.3 billion for potential loan losses, up from $1.9 billion a year ago. It also repurchased $7 billion in common stock and increased its dividend by 12 per cent.JPMorgan shares rose 2 per cent in morning trading. Broader Wall Street indices, however, remained mixed, avoiding the sharp swings seen in recent weeks.Morgan Stanley also reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, driven by strong equities trading.

So far this week, bullion has gained over 5%, as per Reuters report.US gold futures followed suit, jumping nearly 2% to $3,233.80.""Recession risks are mounting, bond yields are soaring, and the US dollar continues to weaken – all factors reinforcing gold's role as a crisis hedge and inflation shield,"" said Alexander Zumpfe, a precious metals trader at Heraeus Metals Germany.The latest surge comes amid renewed trade tensions, with US President Donald Trump escalating tariffs on Chinese imports even after abruptly pausing “reciprocal” tariffs on other countries. The move has done little to ease concerns among global business leaders who fear further economic fallout from the unpredictable trade war Global stock markets slipped, and the US dollar index dropped to a 10-year low, making dollar-denominated gold more affordable for international buyers and further boosting demand.Gold’s remarkable rally, which began last year, continues to gain momentum. The metal is up nearly 21% year-to-date, buoyed by geopolitical uncertainty, strong central bank buying, and increased flows into gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs).""We believe gold has further to run—in the upside case, we target USD 3,400-3,500/oz over the months ahead,"" said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.On the economic front, US data released Thursday showed an unexpected dip in consumer prices for March.

Elon Musk-founded Tesla has discontinued accepting fresh orders for its Model S and Model X vehicles via its Chinese website, as reported by Reuters on Friday, amid escalating trade tensions between the world's leading economies.Customers can no longer place orders for these imported models through Tesla's WeChat mini programme account. Both vehicles are manufactured in the United States before being exported to China.The firm offered no explanation for this decision, which coincides with China's implementation of 84% tariffs on US products, following Trump's imposition of 145% duties on Chinese imports.The American automotive manufacturer produces Model 3 and Model Y vehicles at its Shanghai facility, serving both domestic Chinese market and European exports, which constitute the bulk of its sales.According to Li Yanwei, an analyst at the China Auto Dealers Association, China imported 1,553 Model X cars and 311 Model S cars in 2024.This comes amid an escalating trade war between the US and China, which began with President Trump hiking tariffs and China swiftly retaliating.The US, this week, dramatically raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145% overall, citing unfair trade practices. China quickly retaliated with 84% tariffs on American goods.President Trump pulled back tariffs on other nations, offering a 90-day negotiation window, but held firm on China, declaring other countries are “lining up to negotiate.” In response, China accused the US of bullying and violating global trade norms, vowing to ""fight to the end.""China has stepped up its diplomatic efforts, especially in Europe and Southeast Asia, to build alliances. Premier Li Qiang and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao reached out to EU and ASEAN leaders, though responses have been mixed. Key nations like India, Australia, and even Russia have not joined China’s side.Markets reacted sharply — surging in Asia and Europe due to Trump's partial retreat, while US markets dipped slightly. Despite the economic shockwaves, both nations appear unwilling to back down, raising fears of long-term disruption to global trade.","Customers can no longer place orders for these imported models through Tesla's WeChat mini programme account.

EU pauses retaliation, but warns of ‘bazooka’



Trump says turmoil is ‘cost of transition’



NEW DELHI: Asian markets on Friday slumped with Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 nosediving over 5.6% in early trade, as investors reacted to mounting fears that the US-China trade war is spiralling out of control.The fresh jitters come a day after Wall Street erased much of its historic rally, triggered earlier in the week by President Donald Trump ’s temporary suspension of tariffs on several allies—excluding China.By late morning, Japan’s benchmark index was down 4.7% at 32,969.95. South Korea’s Kospi shed 1.6% while Australia’s ASX 200 lost 2.1%. The yen climbed sharply, with the dollar falling to 143.48 yen from about 146 yen on Thursday, a clear signal of investors rushing to safer assets. Gold also touched a new high as risk-off sentiment spread.The renewed sell-off was sparked after the White House clarified that Chinese imports will now face a 145% tariff rate, once earlier layers are included. Beijing swiftly responded with 84% tariffs on US goods and announced plans to reduce the number of Hollywood films imported—shaking stocks like Warner Bros. Discovery, which plunged 12.5%.US markets suffered their worst single-day drop in months on Thursday, effectively erasing the optimism sparked by earlier trade pauses.The S&P 500 slid 3.5%, closing at 5,268.05, while the Nasdaq suffered an even steeper fall of 4.3%. The Dow Jones tumbled 2.5%, shedding over 1,000 points to end at 39,593.66. The selloff was broad-based, with tech, financials, and consumer stocks all taking heavy hits. The plunge reflected deepening investor anxiety over rising tariffs, recession risks, and the possibility of a global slowdown.President Donald Trump confirmed on Thursday that his administration will move forward with a massive 145% tariff package on Chinese goods, significantly higher than the 125% figure floated earlier. While the White House recently paused tariffs on allies like the EU, Japan, and the UK, Trump framed the China move as a “necessary correction” to decades of unfair trade practices. “We’re bringing the jobs back. It’s tough love, but we’ll win,” he told reporters. Businesses and economists warned the steep duties could raise consumer prices and disrupt supply chains, particularly in electronics, automotive, and machinery sectors.Beijing responded swiftly to Trump’s tariff escalation, slapping 84% tariffs on key American exports including agricultural goods, electronics, and semiconductors. The Chinese government also announced a sharp reduction in the number of American films allowed to screen in China, a move that dealt a heavy blow to Hollywood. Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery plunged 12.5%, while Disney fell 6.8% amid fears of long-term market access losses. Analysts said the film industry, already grappling with streaming disruptions, could face major revenue hits if Chinese market access continues to narrow.Gold prices hit an all-time high as nervous investors piled into safe-haven assets amid deepening market turmoil. Uncertainty over global trade, equity volatility, and weakening currencies fuelled demand for the precious metal. Meanwhile, oil prices moved in the opposite direction. US crude fell 37 cents to $59.70 a barrel, while Brent crude dipped to $63.03. Traders pointed to concerns over potential demand destruction from slowing global growth and rising tariffs.The European Union said it would suspend its planned $22.4 billion in retaliatory tariffs against the United States for 90 days, offering a diplomatic window for negotiations. However, EU officials issued a stern warning, saying they are prepared to use their newly-adopted “anti-coercion instrument” — dubbed the ‘bazooka’ — if talks collapse. This tool gives the EU sweeping powers to impose countermeasures against economic bullying. While the pause was welcomed by business groups, Brussels made it clear that its patience has limits.Amid mounting market losses and global backlash, President Trump remained defiant, describing the economic upheaval as a “transition problem” necessary to achieve long-term prosperity. “We’ve been taken advantage of for decades. This is the correction — and when it’s over, it’ll be beautiful,” Trump said. He dismissed concerns about short-term pain, insisting that the tariff strategy would ultimately boost American manufacturing and reduce reliance on China. Critics, however, argue that Trump is underestimating the ripple effects on consumers, businesses, and global stability.(With inputs from agencies)","Nikkei 225 plunged 5.6% initially, later trading down 4.7% at 32,969.95 by mid- morning in Tokyo. yen surged against the US dollar, trading at ¥143.48, stronger than ¥146 the day before.

This is because the pace of policy changes by Trump and the wide range of areas he covered in less than three months, has left most business leaders doubting the stability of decisions by Trump.""Beneath the current euphoria lies a more stubborn truth: Markets may breathe easier in the short term, but the long-term damage to trust is real,"" said Nigel Green, CEO, deVere Group, a London-based global financial advisory. The US markets' trading pattern in Thursday's early trades gave credence to what experts were thinking. In opening trades, rather than building on Wednesday's record-breaking rally, the US market was deep in the red (down 4%).US markets which on Wednesday broke several records - S& jumped 9.5%, the biggest single-day gain since the global financial crisis in 2008-09; Dow Jones Index shot up by 2,900 points, the single-biggest one-day gain ever for one of the world's most tracked indices; and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 12.2%, its biggest single-session jump in nearly a quarter of a century - reversed gains a day later.By mid-session Thursday, Dow was down nearly 1,800 points (4.4%), Nasdaq was down over 1,000 points (6.1%) and S& was trading 280 points (5.2%) in the red.Earlier, during Wednesday's rally, the magnificent 7 (Mag 7) stocks added $1.5 trillion in just one session, of which $440 billion was by the chip giant Nvidia alone.

Economists, however, warned that the inflation data reflects only the past and provides little reassurance for what lies ahead. There are also growing fears that inflation could accelerate again if tariffs continue to weigh on consumer and business costs.President Donald Trump’s sudden decision to pause a number of tariffs globally triggered Wednesday’s surge, but markets remain cautious. Trump is still pressing ahead with steeper tariffs on Chinese goods—raising them to a punishing 125 per cent. Even a potential negotiation that reduced them to 50 per cent would still pose a major threat to US corporate earnings, UBS strategist Bhanu Baweja cautioned.In response, China has been quietly building alliances with other global players to push back against Washington’s trade stance. The European Union, meanwhile, said on Thursday that it would delay its retaliatory measures for 90 days, signalling hope for a diplomatic resolution.Trump and treasury secretary Scott Bessent issued a pointed message following the tariff pause , “Do not retaliate, and you will be rewarded.”Despite that, market watchers remain on edge. The S&P 500 is still trading below levels seen before Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs last week, and investors are bracing for further volatility.There was a glimmer of relief in the bond market, where conditions appeared to stabilise after days of turbulence. Earlier in the week, a sharp rise in US Treasury yields had unnerved investors. At one point, the 10-year Treasury yield surged to nearly 4.50 per cent, up from 4.01 per cent just days earlier, amid speculation that hedge funds and overseas investors were dumping US debt.Overseas, markets surged in their first session since the tariff pause.

"US inflation cools down despite Trump's trade war, aided by falling gas prices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-cools-down-despite-trumps-trade-war-aided-by-falling-gas-prices/articleshow/120166340.cms,"Inflation in the United States cooled last month as falling petrol, air travel and hotel stay costs, helped ease the financial strain on consumers amid growing concerns over Trump’s tariff war.According to the US labor department, consumer prices rose by 2.4 per cent in March as compared to a year earlier, marking a major drop from February’s 2.8 per cent and the slowest rate of inflation since September.Excluding volatile categories like food and energy costs, core inflation also slowed. Core prices climbed 2.8 per cent year-on-year, down from 3.1 per cent in February, marking the weakest annual gain in nearly four years. Economists consider core inflation a more reliable indicator of long-term price trends.On a monthly basis, overall prices dipped 0.1 per cent, the first monthly decline in almost five years. Core prices edged up just 0.1 per cent from February to March.However, experts were quick to caution against reading too much into the latest figures and said that President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies could soon reverse the trend.“We got a huge tariff increase,” said Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Wealth Management.“There was an extreme tariff increase for less than 24 hours, and we’re back to a huge tariff increase, relative to where we were a month ago. This is increasing taxes on US consumers. And they’re going to have to find the money to pay these taxes.”Last week, Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly 60 countries, sparking market volatility and widespread economic uncertainty. Although he announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs this Wednesday, except China. Trump increased the tariff from 84 per cent to 125 per cent on Chinese goods.Economists expect these measures to push inflation higher over the next few months, with elevated prices possibly persisting through the end of the year.Travel-related costs were a major driver behind March’s inflation slowdown. Airfares dropped 5.3 per cent month-on-month, while hotel prices slid 3.5 per cent, reflecting a steep fall in international tourism. Government data showed a 12 per cent decline in overseas visitors to the US last month, which analysts have linked to Trump’s hardline trade approach.Used car prices also dipped by 0.7 per cent, and the cost of car insurance fell 0.8 per cent, offering some relief for motorists. However, insurance premiums remained 7.5 per cent higher than a year ago.Groceries, on the other hand, became more expensive. Food prices jumped 0.5 per cent in March, with eggs surging 5.9 per cent to a record $6.23 per dozen. Clothing costs rose 0.4 per cent, though annual gains remain modest.The uncertainty around trade policy continues to weigh heavily on businesses. Many firms are bracing for higher costs, particularly those reliant on Chinese imports like mobile phones, clothes, shoes, and toys. The US imports over $60 billion worth of mobile phones annually from China alone.While some American companies have begun shifting production away from China, these transitions take time and could drive up costs further.Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the fragile outlook, stating last week that interest rates would likely remain steady at around 4.3 per cent as the central bank monitors the situation.“There’s a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us,” Powell said. “And that just seems like the right thing to do in this period of uncertainty.”President Trump, meanwhile, called on the Fed to cut interest rates on Friday, adding to the ongoing tension between the White House and the central bank.","Consumer prices rose by 2.4 per cent in March as compared to a year earlier.

Contrasting worlds collide

Aiming for a renaissance

Turning the tables on France

NEW DELHI: Italian powerhouse Prada announced Thursday it will acquire flamboyant rival Versace from US-based Capri Holdings in a €1.25 billion (over Rs 12,000 crore) deal, a move poised to reshape the balance of power in high fashion.The deal, set to close in the second half of 2025, creates an Italian luxury giant with revenues exceeding €6 billion — a bold challenge to French behemoths like LVMH and Kering, amid a global slowdown in luxury spending.“We are delighted to welcome Versace to the Prada Group,” said Patrizio Bertelli, Prada’s executive director and long-time helmsperson of the brand. “We share a strong commitment to creativity, craftsmanship, and heritage.”The acquisition comes at a discount. Capri Holdings, which acquired Versace for €1.83 billion in 2018, had to accept a reduced offer from Prada due to weakened sales and Trump-era tariffs that dented valuations.Adding to the intrigue, Donatella Versace — who took over the house after the tragic murder of her brother Gianni in 1997 — stepped down as creative director on April 1, paving the way for the deal.Donatella, now 69, will serve as the label’s chief brand ambassador.Her replacement, Dario Vitale, is the force behind the rise of Prada’s edgy younger sibling, Miu Miu — signaling a potential pivot for Versace from glitz to Gen Z.The merger brings together two distinct worlds: Versace’s opulent, baroque aesthetic and Prada’s cerebral minimalism. Prada insists it won’t erase Versace’s DNA but will instead enhance it with “industrial capabilities and operational expertise.”Yet analysts warn of a delicate balancing act.“This is a risky move,” said Luca Solca, luxury analyst at Bernstein. “Prada may become distracted from its core business, as happened with earlier acquisitions like Jil Sander and Helmut Lang.”Versace’s third-quarter revenue in fiscal 2025 fell 15 percent to $193 million, a far cry from Prada’s soaring performance. Under the guidance of creative director Miuccia Prada and CEO Andrea Guerra, Prada posted a 25 percent jump in net profit in 2024, reaching €839 million, with revenue climbing to €5.4 billion.Guerra acknowledged the task ahead: “The journey will be long and will require disciplined execution. Versace has huge potential — but evolution takes time.”The acquisition is more than a financial move — it’s a statement of intent. In recent years, French conglomerates have scooped up Italy’s brightest stars: Gucci, Fendi, Bottega Veneta. With this deal, Prada flips the script.“Prada will be able to bring light back into a brand that was dying and infuse it with new life,” said design consultant Antonio Bandini Conti.W hether the strategy pays off remains to be seen. But in a world where fashion loves a comeback, Prada is betting that Versace’s next chapter — wrapped in minimalist luxury and turbocharged by Milanese precision — could be its boldest yet.","Italian powerhouse Prada announced Thursday it will acquire flamboyant rival Versace from US-based Capri Holdings in a €1.25 billion (over Rs 12,000 crore) deal.

For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of carbon use per year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

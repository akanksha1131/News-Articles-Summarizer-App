According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for September 12, 2025 are Reliance Industries, and Persistent Systems. Here’s its view on Nifty and Bank Nifty:

Index View: NIFTY

Progress on Indo-US Bilateral Trade Deal Negotiations – Market participants will closely track any material developments on the trade front, which could act as a significant sentiment driver and impact sector-specific flows. US Macro Data Prints – Upcoming releases of MoM CPI and labor market data will be crucial in shaping expectations around the Fed’s policy trajectory and broader risk appetite. India CPI Inflation Print – A critical domestic macro indicator, with any deviation from consensus likely to influence RBI’s policy stance and equity/bond market dynamics. US Dollar Index (DXY) – The DXY continues to trade below the structural breakdown zone around the 100 mark, reinforcing a corrective bias in the greenback, which could support EM flows. Crude Oil Price Action – Brent crude remains capped below its 20-week EMA, signaling bearish undertones in the commodity and potentially easing inflationary pressures for import-dependent economies like India.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices exhibited a range-bound yet upwardly biased price action during the week, underpinned by renewed optimism surrounding Indo-US trade dialogues. This positive undertone was further supported by constructive global cues and persistent accumulation in select index heavyweights, enhancing overall market sentiment.The Nifty 50 has taken approximately 10 weeks to retrace a mere 38.2% of its preceding 12-week uptrend from 21,744 to 25,669. Such a shallow retracement post a strong impulse leg is indicative of underlying market strength and bullish structural integrity.Over the past three weeks, the Nifty has been consolidating within a well-defined range of 24,400–25,000 and is currently positioned near the upper bound of this range. A sustained breakout above the psychological mark of 25,000 is likely to trigger a short-term continuation move towards the key resistance zone of 25,200–25,250.A decisive close above 25,250 would mark a trend reversal confirmation from the ongoing corrective phase and could potentially unlock further upside towards the 25,500 handle in the coming weeks.On the downside, immediate support is seen near the 24,700 level, while critical short-term support resides in the 24,400–24,300 zone. This area represents a confluence of recent swing lows and the 200-day EMA, thereby making it a pivotal support cluster to watch for trend validation.In the broader market space, both the Nifty Midcap and Small Cap indices continue to hover near their 52-week exponential moving averages, which have been respected since April 2025. This prolonged resilience around a major moving average base offers a constructive setup for incremental accumulation, particularly in quality mid and small-cap names.Key Monitorables Going Forward:The Bank Nifty has resumed its positive momentum, as reflected by the higher-high and higher-low formation on the daily chart, effectively negating the recent corrective trend.The 200-day EMA has proven to be a reliable support zone on the daily timeframe. Following a phase of consolidation around this crucial moving average, the index has absorbed selling pressure and is now positioning itself for the next leg of its up move.A breakout from the recent consolidation zone further reinforces the continuation of the uptrend, with immediate support placed at Monday’s low of 54,300. On the upside, the index carries the potential to move towards 55,350, based on the measured move of the consolidation range (53,779–54,670).On the downside, key support is placed at 53,500–53,300, which coincides with the 200-day EMA and the swing low of May 2025.Reliance Industries' stock has undergone a corrective phase over the past two months and is currently consolidating near a crucial support zone. This technical setup offers a favorable risk-reward profile, positioning the stock for a potential bullish reversal and the next leg of the uptrend.The stock is currently exhibiting base-building price action around the key demand zone of ₹1300–₹1340, which marks a confluence of multiple technical factors supporting a potential reversal: (a) 50% retracement of the previous April-June 2025 up move (1115-1551), (b) 52 weeks EMA placed around 1360 (c) Previous major breakout area placed around 1330 levels which is likely to reverse its role and act as support in the medium term as per change of polarity concept.The ongoing corrective phase appears to be nearing exhaustion, with price action indicating the potential for a fresh bullish reversal. We anticipate stock to resume its primary uptrend and retest the previous swing highs around ₹1540 in the upcoming quarters, which correspond to the key resistance zones marked by the September 2024 and July 2025 peaks.The stock after the recent corrective decline is forming a potential double bottom in the daily chart thus offers fresh entry opportunity with favorable risk-reward set up.It has generated a breakout above the falling trendline containing the last 3 months corrective decline highlighting reversal of the corrective trend. Strong support is placed in the range of 5000-5050 levels being the confluence of the last two months lows and key retracement area.We expect the stock to head higher towards 5930 levels being the 80% retracement of the previous June-August decline (6180-5008).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for September 12, 2025 are Reliance Industries, and Persistent Systems. The Bank Nifty has resumed its positive momentum, as reflected by the higher-high and higher-low formation on the daily chart, effectively negating the recent corrective trend.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123841325,imgsize-90922,width-400,resizemode-4/top-stocks-to-buy.jpg"

Chinese auto market: Govt unveils plan to 'stabilise' sector; emphasis on 'cost surveys and price monitoring',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-auto-market-govt-unveils-plan-to-stabilise-sector-emphasis-on-cost-surveys-and-price-monitoring/articleshow/123871975.cms,"



China rolled out a two-year plan aimed at easing turbulence in its car industry, where aggressive price cuts and trade disputes have weighed heavily on growth.State news agency Xinhua said the programme, covering 2025 and 2026, was issued jointly by eight government departments. It places emphasis on “cost surveys and price monitoring” while urging carmakers to step up innovation and stimulate home demand.The sector is expected to see sales of about 32.3 million vehicles this year, a rise of 3%. That is slower than the 4.5% expansion recorded in 2024, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.Beijing has funnelled significant funds into the electric vehicle sector, hoping to position the country as a global leader. The new plan sets an ambitious target of 15.5 million new energy vehicles to be sold in 2025, representing 20% year-on-year growth.Yet the industry is under pressure from a cut-throat price war. Cheap models and trade-in deals have flooded the market, pushing many smaller firms out of business. At a meeting in July, officials urged carmakers to abandon “irrational competition” in favour of healthy development.China’s drive to export more vehicles is also meeting resistance. The EU launched a probe in 2023 into possible unfair competition in the sector, and this week Mexico announced plans to hike tariffs on Chinese car imports to 50% from the current 15–20%, a decision that sparked an angry response from Beijing.","State news agency Xinhua said the programme, covering 2025 and 2026, was issued jointly by eight government departments.

GST has to be paid on discounted price: CBIC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-has-to-be-paid-on-discounted-price-cbic/articleshow/123874921.cms,"India's GST Big Reset Is Logical, Transparent, And Not About Trump Tariffs: Says Sanjeev Sanyal





NEW DELHI: The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs issued much-awaited clarifications to address problems faced by businesses when companies offer discounts to sellers. The move follows a discussion in this regard at the last all-important meeting of the GST Council, where GST rates were reduced.Very often dealers are offered discounts to push products lying in their inventory. For instance, a new model of a mobile phone may impact the sale of an earlier version lying in the dealer's inventory. In such cases, companies can offer a 10% discount for a device which costs, say, Rs 20,000. As a result, the retailer would sell the device for Rs 18,000, but the tax authorities often claimed that GST should be paid on Rs 20,000. Now, the department has clarified that tax has to be paid on the discounted price.However, at times the company asks the retailer to sell at the discounted price and the discount is routed through a distributor. In such cases, the department is of the view that tax should be paid on Rs 20,000 as there was no contract with the retailer.""This is a welcome circular as it provides much-needed clarity on the GST treatment of various types of discount transactions between manufacturers and distributors and dealers. The clarification will help industry and trade execute such transactions with greater certainty and reduce disputes around what has long been a contentious issue. For scenarios involving agreements with end customers for passing on specific benefits to end-consumers through dealers in the supply chain, businesses may need to evaluate their positions,"" said Abhishek Jain, partner and national head for indirect tax at KPMG, India.","The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs issued much-awaited clarifications to address problems faced by businesses.

NEW DELHI: Public sector banks need to aspire to global competitiveness, strengthen governance and operational resilience, and expand their role as sectoral champions across both traditional and emerging industries, a top official told the two-day brainstorming session of state run banks. M Nagaraju, secretary department of financial services, underlined that public sector banks have moved beyond the phase of survival and stability and are now positioned to play a larger role as champions of growth, innovation, and leadership in the journey towards Viksit Bharat by 2047. The discussion during the two-day ""PSB Manthan"" emphasised that PSBs should aspire to evolve into globally competitive banks, with the scale, presence, and capabilities to support Indian enterprises overseas and stand alongside leading financial institutions worldwide.It stressed the importance of modernising technology of state run banks by moving beyond legacy systems to agile and interoperable platforms capable of delivering seamless digital services, enhancing cyber resilience, and integrating effectively with digital public infrastructure. It was suggested PSBs put in place robust governance frameworks for Artificial Intelligence.","Public sector banks need to aspire to global competitiveness, strengthen governance and operational resilience, a top official told the two-day brainstorming session.

GST revamp: Goods and services tax not applicable on these post-sale discounts; here is what experts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-revamp-goods-and-services-tax-not-applicable-on-these-post-sale-discounts-here-is-what-experts-say/articleshow/123872817.cms,"



The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) clarified that post-sale discounts offered by manufacturers to dealers, aimed purely at competitive pricing and driving sales, will not attract Goods and Services Tax GST ).In a circular, the board further explained that GST would, however, apply if such discounts are linked to specific promotional services carried out by dealers on behalf of the manufacturer, such as co-branding initiatives, advertising campaigns or customised sales drives.The clarification follows multiple representations received by the CBIC on the treatment of secondary or post-sale discounts under GST, PTI reported.According to the circular, dealers may sometimes engage in promotional efforts after receiving discounts, but these actions usually help them sell the goods they own and, in turn, increase their own earnings. In such situations, the board said, the discount functions only as a reduction in the sale price of goods rather than as consideration for a separate service.""Therefore, it is clarified that post-sale discounts offered by manufacturers to dealers in such cases shall not be treated as consideration for a separate transaction of supply of services,"" the CBIC circular stated.The tax will only apply, the board noted, if agreements explicitly state that dealers will perform promotional services like exhibitions, customised campaigns, advertising or customer support, with a defined payment for such activities.Commenting on the circular, AMRG & Associates senior partner Rajat Mohan pointed out that while dealers often run small marketing campaigns or quick sales drives, such efforts are usually undertaken to boost their own sales volumes.""The government has rightly clarified that these routine trade discounts cannot be treated as payment for any service provided by the dealer to the manufacturer, and therefore no additional GST liability arises in such cases,"" Mohan was quoted as saying by PTI.EY tax partner Saurabh Agarwal said the clarification rightly differentiates between a straightforward trade discount and a service transaction. He added that the position confirms that where the manufacturer-dealer relationship is on a principal-to-principal basis, discounts meant purely for sales promotion or competitive pricing cannot be viewed as payment for services.He also stressed that this move addresses a major source of confusion. ""In light of these clarifications, businesses must revisit their contractual arrangements and tax positions. The government's clear demarcation between trade discounts and promotional services will significantly reduce interpretational disputes and provide greater certainty in compliance for the industry, paving the way for a more streamlined GST regime,"" Agarwal told PTI.Grant Thornton Bharat partner Manoj Mishra noted that the CBIC’s guidance resolves a long-standing dispute. He highlighted that the assurance on input tax credit, which remains unaffected when financial or commercial credit notes are issued, eliminates a significant compliance risk for dealers.""From a practical standpoint, this puts the onus on businesses to carefully document agreements, credit notes, and customer-level pricing arrangements.”""Overall, the clarification is a pragmatic move that strengthens certainty, reduces litigation, and provides a workable framework for industry,"" Mishra said.","Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) clarified that post-sale discounts offered by manufacturers to dealers, aimed purely at competitive pricing and driving sales, will not attract GST.

The Matchmaker's Return: How Nandini Brought Ancient Wisdom to Modern Dating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/the-matchmakers-return-how-nandini-brought-ancient-wisdom-to-modern-dating/articleshow/123877680.cms,"Nandini started building again.





The first time Nandini tried to set someone up was at her eighth standard social at Cathedral School in Mumbai, 2008. She was barely a teenager, but already she understood something that would take the dating app industry decades to figure out: successful matchmaking is about listening.Sixteen years later, Nandini sits in her company’s office, having just raised $7 million for Sitch, an AI-powered matchmaking service that’s challenging the entire premise of modern dating apps. Her journey from teenage cupid to venture-backed founder reveals a deeper truth about technology: sometimes the most innovative solutions look remarkably like ancient wisdom, updated for modern times.“I always joke that with cofounders, just like in your dating life, you gotta have a few ex-boyfriends before you meet your husband,” Nandini says, referring to her previous startup that failed. “Same thing with cofounders. You don’t give up. Real founders keep going against all odds.”This philosophy of persistence through failure has defined Nandini’s approach to entrepreneurship. Her first dating app venture ended in a cofounder split and shutdown, despite showing promise. “I had put my heart and soul in it,” she recalls. “To go from saying ‘I'm gonna be a founder’ to ‘I have nothing to show for it’ was really difficult.”The dating app industry seemed like an unlikely place for innovation. Since Hinge and The League gained traction, few new entrants have achieved meaningful scale or attracted serious institutional investment. The market appeared saturated, dominated by Match Group’s portfolio and a handful of established players.But Nandini identified a fundamental shift happening in consumer behavior. “We’re moving towards Concierge-based services,” she explains. “If I’m trying to get in shape, I’m not figuring it out myself; my trainer gives me a workout and I follow it. Why is it that with dating, we’re like ‘you should be swiping through all these people, figuring out if they’re legitimate’?”This insight led to Sitch’s core proposition: instead of endless swiping, users work with matchmakers who conduct 30-minute onboarding sessions and provide personalized matches based on deep compatibility analysis.The difference becomes clear when Nandini describes what traditional apps miss: “Hinge might know you’re South Asian, but it doesn’t know what kind of South Asian you are, whether you were born in the US, whether you want someone who’s Punjabi from the North. On your Hinge profile, you wrote that you love margaritas and Mexican food. How is that helping determine who you’re gonna marry?”Sitch asks different questions entirely. Instead of favorite restaurants, they want to know if going to restaurants is something you enjoy or if you prefer cooking at home. Whether you’d rather spend money on extravagant holidays or invest in long-term stability. These data points are fundamental to relationship compatibility.“Our secret sauce is the conversation,” Nandini explains. “What is a good matchmaker? A good matchmaker is a good listener.”This approach has resonated beyond Nandini's expectations. The company launched in 2024 and has already expanded to three cities, with waitlists in twelve more. They’re planning to cover all major US cities by early next year, then expand internationally.What’s particularly striking is how Sitch represents a cultural moment where Eastern wisdom is gaining traction in Western markets. “The app getting attention on TechCrunch and CNBC is fundamentally an Indian concept,” Nandini notes. “People in New York are suddenly like ‘maybe I should get a matchmaker, maybe they’ve got it right.’”“This is the biggest decision you’re probably gonna make: who you pick as your life partner,” Nandini argues. “Why should you be making it alone? No man is an island.”The technical challenge lies in scaling personal matchmaking. How do you provide individualized attention to millions of users? Nandini’s answer involves what she calls “productizing myself”: building AI that captures her matchmaking intuition and conversation style.“Someone at a16z said they did the onboarding with the AI and heard me speak, and it’s actually the same,” she recounts. “That’s a really interesting philosophical question we’re asking about who we are and what it means to be human.”This scaling challenge reflects broader questions about AI and automation. Unlike dating apps that can easily accommodate unlimited users, Sitch’s model requires maintaining quality relationships with each member. Success depends on making people feel “seen” and “understood”.The business model also differs fundamentally from existing dating apps. While Match Group profits from keeping users engaged and paying for premium features, Sitch succeeds when people find relationships and leave the platform. This alignment of incentives may prove crucial to long-term sustainability.“Dating apps without institutional funding get bought by Match Group really fast for really cheap, or they never get off the ground,” Nandini observes. This insight influenced their fundraising strategy, targeting multistage investors committed to long-term growth rather than quick exits.The company’s city-by-city expansion strategy reflects Sitch’s hyperlocal approach. Rather than generic national campaigns, they create marketing tailored to each city’s dating culture. San Francisco gets “ChatGPT can’t find you a girlfriend, but I can.” New York focuses on expensive bad first dates. The message adapts, but the core promise remains: we understand you, therefore we understand who you’re looking for.“We’re not looking for similar people,” Nandini clarifies. “We're looking for compatibility. Are the things you want compatible with what this person wants? Are the character traits you’re looking for aligned with what this person offers?”As Sitch prepares for rapid expansion, Nandini faces the founder’s eternal question: how fast can we scale without losing what makes us special? With a team of twelve and ambitious goals to help “millions of people across the world,” the pressure to accelerate growth is constant.“I probably spend most of my time thinking about how we can move faster,” she admits. “Everyone deserves to feel loved, and we want to make sure they get that.”Whether ancient matchmaking wisdom can scale to modern technological demands remains to be seen. Nandini’s journey suggests that sometimes the most innovative path forward involves rediscovering what worked before algorithms took over: the simple but profound act of really listening to what people want, then helping them find it.","Sitch is an AI-powered matchmaking service that’s challenging the entire premise of modern dating apps.

Inflation outlook: Economists lower forecasts despite August uptick; GST reforms to provide support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/inflation-outlook-economists-lower-forecasts-despite-august-uptick-gst-reforms-to-provide-support/articleshow/123870520.cms,"



India’s retail inflation inched up in August, though experts say that the increase is likely temporary and should not disrupt the country’s overall price stability, supported by recent GST reforms.According to official data released on Friday, retail inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), rose to 2.07% year-on-year in August 2025, up from 1.61% in July. Despite the 46 basis-point jump, inflation remained well within the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) comfort range of 2-6%.Food prices, which had been steady for several months, began to show signs of firming. While global inflationary pressures have concerned many countries, India has largely maintained a stable trajectory, ANI reported.The RBI had kept its benchmark repo rate at 6.5% for 11 consecutive meetings before cutting it for the first time in almost five years in February 2025. Following its latest Monetary Policy Committee review, the RBI revised its inflation forecast for 2025-26 down from 4% to 3.7%.Hanna Luchnikava-Schorsch, Head of Asia-Pacific Economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the August data matched expectations.“India's headline CPI inflation edged up to 2.1% year on year in August from 1.6% year on year in July, aligning with our projections. As we anticipated, inflation bottomed in July, with consumer prices rising at a faster clip in August on the back of fading base effects, solid demand, and weakening rupee,” she said.She added that GST rate cuts are expected to moderate future inflation.“The effects of GST rate cuts should lower the pace of acceleration from October onwards, keeping the headline inflation rate within or near the central bank's 4% target range midpoint through the end of 2025,” ANI quoted the expert.S&P Global now projects CPI inflation for FY26 to average 3.3%, down from the previous forecast of 3.5%.Industry leaders welcomed the report. Hemant Jain, President of the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI), said, “Looking ahead, we anticipate a further decline in CPI inflation, aided by the GST 2.0 reforms package. The proposed simplified two-tier structure will reduce production costs, translate into lower prices, and, in turn, stimulate consumption.”Rajani Sinha, chief economist at CareEdge, described the August figure as “comfortable.”“Headline inflation inched up to 2.1% in August as the favourable base effect waned and food prices moved out of deflation. However, it remained at comfortable levels owing to muted food inflation,” Sinha said, adding that a good monsoon, adequate reservoir levels, and strong kharif sowing should support food price stability.She also highlighted the impact of GST rationalisation.“We estimate that it could lower CPI inflation by 70-90 bps annually under the current basket, assuming effective pass-through to consumers. With food inflation subdued and demand-side pressures contained, we now lower our inflation projection for FY26 to 2.7% from 3.1% earlier,” Sinha said, as quoted by ANI.Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil, said, “Given the lower-than-expected food inflation and the expected easing of core inflation in the coming months due to the reduction in the goods and services tax, we have revised our inflation forecast down to 3.2% from 3.5% for this fiscal.”Joshi added that the revision could allow for further monetary easing,“…we expect the RBI to cut the repo rate by another 25 basis points later this fiscal.”Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser at State Bank of India, was more cautious.“With August inflation print a tad higher than the 2% mark, a rate cut in October looks onerous. Even a rate cut in December looks a little difficult if growth numbers for Q1 and Q2 are taken into consideration,” Ghosh said.The CPI data for September 2025 is scheduled for release on October 13, or the next working day if the date falls on a holiday.","Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 2.07% year-on-year in August 2025, up from 1.61% in July.

Kavin Mittal shuts down Hike owing to India’s gaming ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/kavin-mittal-shuts-down-hike-owing-to-indias-gaming-ban/articleshow/123870861.cms,"



BENGALURU: Hike founder Kavin Mittal on Saturday announced the shutdown of his startup bringing to a close a 13-year journey that saw the company emerge from a homegrown messaging app to a player in casual gaming.Mittal, who is the son of Bharti Enterprises founder and chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal, announced the decision in a blog post on the online platform Substack and said the decision was taken after a careful review with investors.The decision follows the regulatory ban on real-money gaming in India, a move that fundamentally undermined Hike’s business model and prospects for future growth.“Our US business, launched just nine months ago, is off to a strong start. But after the India ban, scaling globally would require a full recap, a reset that is not the best use of capital or time,” Mittal said in his post.Mittal described the foray into real-money gaming as a temporary strategy that became a long-term commitment amid regulatory challenges.He now considers the market to be premature for his broader “Gaming Nation” vision, emphasising that regulatory uncertainty, both in gaming and emerging areas like crypto, created hurdles.Hike Messenger once reached 40 million monthly users and earned a place among the country’s top consumer brands. Its later pivot, Rush, grew quickly to 10 million users and over $500 million in gross revenue, according to the blog post.Mittal termed the shutdown as a difficult but necessary step. He signaled his intent to focus in the coming years on three transformative frontiers: artificial intelligence, breakthroughs in energy and mastery of the self.","Hike founder Kavin Mittal announced the shutdown of his startup.

Real estate sector: Institutional investors infuse $80 billion since 2010; foreign capital dominates 57% inflows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/real-estate-sector-institutional-investors-infuse-80-billion-since-2010-foreign-capital-dominates-57-inflows/articleshow/123870060.cms,"



India’s property market has pulled in almost $80 billion in institutional investments over the past 15 years, highlighting its rise as a favoured asset class for global and local investors, a report by Colliers and CREDAI said.Foreign investors have played the bigger role so far, contributing 57% of the total inflows since 2010. Yet, the study points out that domestic capital has been gaining ground, particularly after the pandemic, suggesting a notable shift in the way different asset classes are funded.According to the report, institutional funds have flowed in from a wide spectrum of sources: including family offices, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, private equity firms, foreign corporates, NBFCs, listed REITs and developer-backed real estate funds.A series of policy reforms has helped build this momentum. The introduction of RERA, the roll-out of GST, and the launch of REITs have improved transparency, efficiency and institutional confidence in the sector, the report said.By 2047, when India marks 100 years of Independence, the sector could be valued between $5 and 10 trillion, up from the current market size of around $0.3 trillion, Colliers and CREDAI projected.The transformation of the industry has been marked. From being mostly fragmented and unorganised in the 1990s, real estate has become a more structured and accountable contributor to economic growth. Its share in GDP has gone up from under 5% before 2010 to about 6–8% in recent years, while in 2025 alone it added nearly $0.3 trillion to the economy.REITs are emerging as another important trend, offering Indian investors yields of 6–7%, higher than global averages. By definition, REITs are firms that own and manage real estate assets to generate income, making them a growing option for investment.","Foreign investors have played the bigger role so far, contributing 57% of the total inflows since 2010.

India-US ties: Signs of thaw

Special relationship

Why has the US softened its stance on trade deal talks?

Friction in ties remains





Amidst signs of thaw in the India-US trade deal issues, government officials are likely to travel to America next week. The recent social media post exchanges between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump indicate an improvement in relations following a period of tension.Trade talks are set to resume next week, following a pause triggered by the US imposing additional 25% tariff on India regarding Russian oil purchases. Both leaders are also expected to hold a telephone discussion soon.According to an ET report, Rajesh Agarwal, the chief trade negotiator, will travel to Washington for continued discussions with American officials. A source familiar with the matter quoted in the report indicated the situation remains fluid, with uncertainty surrounding potential US tariff concessions in the coming months.Modi and Trump have expressed mutual goodwill, with the PM responding to the US President's friendly overture on Wednesday. Trump had earlier referred to the Prime Minister as a ""dear friend"" and indicated positive developments in the previously stalled trade discussions.""India and the US are close friends,"" Modi wrote on X. ""I am confident our trade negotiations will pave the way for unlocking the limitless potential of the India-US partnership.Our teams are working to conclude these discussions at the earliest.""""I am also looking forward to speaking with President Trump. We will work together to secure a brighter, more prosperous future for both our people,"" Modi said in response to Trump's mention of the upcoming telephone conversation.On Wednesday morning, Trump posted on Truth Social stating that he was ""pleased to announce India and the US are continuing negotiations to address the trade barriers between our two nations.""Also Read | India-US trade deal: Should India be enthralled by Donald Trump’s outreach to PM Modi?

This gathering sparked discussions within pro-Trump circles regarding India-US relations.Notably, in the past ten days, Trump has refrained from claiming credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire arrangement, an issue that previously caused friction with New Delhi.Reports indicate that Trump has requested European Union authorities to evaluate implementing up to 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, with suggestions to extend similar measures to India.Diplomatic friction has increased following the US implementation of a 25% duty on Indian imports, subsequently increased to 50% due to India's continued Russian oil procurement.Also Read | Donald Trump wants EU to impose up to 100% tariffs on India, China - but it is unlikely to agree; here’s why Various Trump administration officials, including White House adviser Peter Navarro, who maintains scrutiny on India and BRICS, accuse that India's oil purchases from Russia are supporting Moscow's military operations in Ukraine.India has maintained its position on strategic independence, explaining that its Russian oil purchases are driven by domestic needs and global price stability considerations.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently affirmed India's continued Russian oil imports, emphasising that energy decisions follow national interests and economic reasoning rather than external pressure. She noted that the Reserve Bank of India is diversifying its US treasury holdings whilst purchasing gold.","Trade talks are set to resume next week, following a pause triggered by the US imposing additional 25% tariff on India regarding Russian oil purchases.

Charlie Kirk Killing: New Video Shows Killer Jumping Off Roof, Running Away, Then Limping | Watch





A newly surfaced video has raised questions after it appeared to show a bearded man celebrating in the immediate aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.The clip, widely shared on social media and ripped from live TV feeds, shows a young man in a black T-shirt and backwards baseball cap pumping his fists in the air and shouting “USA! USA! USA!” just seconds after Kirk, 31, was fatally struck in the neck by a sniper’s bullet during a campus debate.While most spectators dropped to the ground in panic, the man remained standing, briefly looking back in the direction of the gunfire before raising his arms. His reaction mirrored chants often heard at Trump rallies, including the president’s own cry after he narrowly survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania last year.Social media users quickly seized on the footage, calling it disturbing and “psychotic.” “This guy happens to know where the shooter was and is looking back, cheering him on after the lifeless body of Charlie Kirk has fallen to the ground,” one X user wrote.Another added: “I have no words left.”The Utah County sheriff’s department confirmed it had been contacted about the video.The man’s identity remains unverified, though an X account later claimed to be the individual seen in the clip. In a post, the user — identifying himself only as David — denied celebrating Kirk’s killing and insisted his actions were intended to “draw attention so the security team could escape.”“There is [a lot] of rage directed at me but I promise you’ll understand when I speak,” he wrote. “Some are upset because I smile, some because I [cheer] and others because they don’t have the information yet.”The account follows several prominent conservative figures, including psychologist Jordan Peterson. Authorities have not confirmed whether the account belongs to the man in the video.Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA and a prominent ally of President Donald Trump , was a father of two. He was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after the shooting.","Video appears to show man cheering moments after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot dead at Utah Valley University.

Pressure at home, pushback abroad

Cracks in the alliance system

A shifting US role





India, long courted by US as a counterweight to China, has suddenly found itself at the sharp end of Donald Trump’s “America First” foreign policy.The US president has ramped up sanctions on New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil, angering Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and straining ties between the world’s two largest democracies.For decades, both Republican and Democratic leaders held up India as a strategic partner in Asia. Trump’s move marks a break from that tradition.Adding to the tension, Trump appeared visibly irritated after PM Modi downplayed US efforts to broker peace between India and Pakistan, even as other world leaders rushed to congratulate the newly returned president. “Trump expected Modi to echo his line more strongly,” AFP quotes a senior diplomat as saying, who was familiar with the exchange.The sanctions come at a moment when India is stepping up defense cooperation with the US while simultaneously balancing its historic ties with Russia. As per the report by AFP, analysts warn Trump’s hard line could push New Delhi closer to Moscow and Beijing.Damian Murphy, a former congressional aide now at the Center for American Progress, said the approach showed “weakness, chaos and vanity.” He argued that leaders like Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu “are pushing for advantage, sensing weakness, and getting away with things that they shouldn’t be able to.”India is not alone in feeling the sting.In Georgia, mass raids at a Hyundai-LG battery plant stunned South Korea, another treaty ally investing billions in the US.Meanwhile, Israel launched strikes inside Qatar, home to America’s largest air base in the Middle East, while Trump stood by. And in Europe, Poland was rattled after 17 Russian drones landed on its territory, despite Trump’s pleas to Moscow for a ceasefire in Ukraine.Trump’s aides defend the moves as holding partners to higher standards, a break from what they call decades of “free riding” by allies. His Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, described it as “America First diplomacy in action.”But scholars warn the approach risks undermining US influence just as global instability rises. “These are smaller instances of a much larger trend,” said Paul Poast, a University of Chicago political scientist. “States feel emboldened to act militarily because the US no longer behaves like the world’s police force.”","India, long courted by US as a counterweight to China, has suddenly found itself at the sharp end of Donald Trump’s “America First” foreign policy.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday said he was willing to impose tough sanctions on Russia, but only if all Nato allies also commit to halting Russian oil imports and implementing similar measures.A day after the Kremlin said that peace talks with Ukraine are on hold, Trump criticised some Nato countries for continuing energy purchases from Russia, calling it “shocking” and damaging to the alliance’s negotiating power.""I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.""As you know, NATO’S commitment to WIN has been far less than 100%, and the purchase of Russian Oil, by some, has been shocking!

France credit downgrade: Fitch cuts rating to A+ from AA- in a record low; political turmoil clouds debt outlook,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/france-credit-downgrade-fitch-cuts-rating-to-a-from-aa-in-a-record-low-political-turmoil-clouds-debt-outlook/articleshow/123863190.cms,"File photo: French President Emmanuel Macron (Picture credit: AP)





France’s sovereign credit rating has been cut by Fitch to A+ from AA-, with the agency warning that public debt will keep rising until at least 2027 unless urgent corrective steps are taken.The move marks the lowest rating France has received on record from a major credit agency, though Fitch maintained a stable outlook for future moves, as per news agency AFP.The downgrade comes at a politically sensitive moment, just days after François Bayrou stepped down as prime minister following a failed parliamentary confidence vote over his austerity-driven budget.Bayrou reacted sharply on X, saying France was “a country whose elites lead it to reject the truth (and) is condemned to pay the price.” President Emmanuel Macron has since appointed Sébastien Lecornu to form a new government, though he faces a divided parliament with little room to push through deep spending cuts.Fitch said the confidence vote defeat showed how “fragmentation and polarisation” in domestic politics weakened France’s ability to deliver fiscal consolidation.The agency added it was unlikely the deficit would be reduced to 3% of GDP by 2029, contrary to earlier government ambitions.France recorded a budget deficit of 5.8% of GDP in 2024 and debt at 113% of GDP, far above eurozone thresholds of 3% and 60%.Fitch now projects debt to climb to 121% by 2027, with no “clear horizon” for stabilisation.Outgoing economy minister Eric Lombard acknowledged the downgrade but insisted on the “solidity” of the French economy. Rising borrowing costs are already evident: French 10-year bond yields reached 3.47% this week, close to Italy’s levels, though Italy carries a much lower rating.Analysts cited by news agency Reuters said the downgrade had largely been priced in, but warned it could spur forced selling of French bonds if other agencies follow suit. Rival rater S&P Global is due to update its assessment in November.For Prime Minister Lecornu, Fitch’s move heightens the challenge of presenting a new budget by early October.To secure support, he may need to soften plans with concessions such as higher taxes on the wealthy or easing pension reforms, though such compromises risk alienating Macron’s centrist base and conservative allies.","France's sovereign credit rating has been cut by Fitch to A+ from AA-, with the agency warning that public debt will keep rising until at least 2027 unless urgent corrective steps are taken.

Russia’s central bank on Friday reduced its benchmark interest rate by one percentage point to 17%, signalling an attempt to support the economy as growth slows and government spending on the war in Ukraine drives the budget deficit higher.The bank, which had previously raised the key rate to 21% to curb inflation, acknowledged that economic activity was being weighed down by high borrowing costs and sought to ease pressure on businesses. Inflation remains elevated at 8.2% despite easing slightly in July and August, with the bank warning that “inflation expectations have not changed considerably in recent months” and could hinder a sustainable slowdown in price rises. AFP reported that the move highloights the tension between controlling inflation and supporting a wartime economy under stress.Year-on-year growth slowed to 1.1% in the second quarter, down from 1.4% in the first quarter and 4.5% at the end of 2024. On a quarterly basis, the economy contracted 0.6%, indicating a recent loss of momentum. The budget deficit rose sharply to 4.9 trillion rubles ($58 billion) in January–July, compared with 1.1 trillion rubles a year earlier, with spending at 129% of planned levels, according to the Kyiv School of Economics.Oil and gas revenues fell 19% from the previous year amid softer global prices.Despite Western sanctions and the loss of gas sales to Europe, Russia’s economy has shown resilience, with unemployment at record lows and household incomes rising. Recruitment bonuses and defense spending have bolstered local demand, while the government finances its deficit by selling ruble bonds to domestic banks, which anticipate further rate cuts.The central bank’s rate cut illustrates the balancing act facing policymakers: supporting growth in a wartime economy while keeping inflation contained, amid persistent global and domestic pressures.",Russia's central bank has reduced its benchmark interest rate by one percentage point to 17%.

South Korea ATTACKS Trump; Big Clash Over Chaining Of Koreans During ICE Hyundai Factory Raid





US President Donald Trump’s drive to boost American manufacturing by drawing foreign investment has collided with his hardline immigration agenda, after a dramatic raid at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia left South Korea warning of investment risks.US immigration authorities raided the site last week, detaining more than 300 South Korean workers, some of whom were shown shackled in chains. The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis, with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung cautioning that companies from his country may rethink Trump’s invitation to pour money into the US.“If the US can’t promptly issue visas to the technicians and other skilled workers needed to launch plants, then establishing a local factory in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies,” Lee said on Thursday.“They will wonder whether they should even do it”, he added.As per news agency AP, the crackdown has clashed with Trump’s trade-driven economic policy.His administration has imposed hefty tariffs, including a 15% levy on South Korean goods, as leverage to force foreign companies to shift production to America. South Korea, already a leading investor, pledged $350 billion in US projects during a July trade deal.But the Georgia raid, involving 475 people in total, has cast a shadow on those commitments.Many of the detained workers were flown back to Seoul on Friday aboard a Korean Air charter plane, drawing a huge media presence and emotional family reunions at Incheon International Airport, as per AP.While the White House insisted Trump remains committed to making the US the “best place in the world to do business” while upholding immigration law, critics labelled the raid “performative.”Immigration lawyer Dan Kowalski was quoted as saying by AP that the roundup was about “wanting to look tough, arresting as many foreigners as possible for the photo-op.”Experts also questioned the enforcement tactic. “It’s really baffling to me why this raid would have occurred. The existence of these workers shouldn’t have been a surprise,” said Ben Armstrong of MIT’s Industrial Performance Center, as per AP.South Korea has long requested reform of the US visa system, which experts say does not account for the temporary inflow of skilled foreign workers needed to set up new plants.Following talks in Washington, South Korean foreign minister Cho Hyun said the two countries agreed to establish a joint working group to explore a new visa category for such workers.Despite the diplomatic efforts, the raid has rattled trust.The battery factory in Georgia is one of more than 20 major industrial projects under construction by South Korean firms in the US. But as President Lee noted, unless the visa system improves, companies may “hesitate to make further investments.”","US immigration authorities raided the site last week, detaining more than 300 South Korean workers, some of whom were shown shackled in chains.

Why it matters for AI





On Wednesday, Oracle stunned Wall Street when its shares surged 36% in a single day, the company’s biggest one-day gain since 1992. The rise followed its announcement of a series of multibillion-dollar deals in artificial intelligence (AI) cloud infrastructure, including a landmark agreement with OpenAI.The rally was so dramatic that Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly overtook Elon Musk as the world’s richest person before market corrections set in.At the centre of the surge is Oracle’s $300 billion, five-year agreement with OpenAI, one of the largest cloud computing contracts ever signed.The company will provide computing resources and infrastructure to power OpenAI’s advanced models.Oracle has also struck deals with Nvidia, SoftBank, Meta, and xAI, signalling its transformation into a core provider of AI infrastructure.CEO Safra Catz revealed that Oracle’s backlog of finalised contracts has reached $455 billion, four times higher than last year, and is expected to cross $500 billion soon.This backlog offers investors confidence in sustained long-term revenue, even as quarterly results sometimes fall short of projections, as reported by ET.Oracle’s position in AI cloud computing now puts it in direct competition with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.The company expects revenue from its cloud infrastructure business to rise 77% to $18 billion this year, and reach $144 billion within four years, according to news agency AP.The surge in Oracle’s stock briefly added around $100 billion to Ellison’s wealth, pushing him past Elon Musk in Bloomberg’s billionaire rankings.Musk, whose fortune is closely tied to Tesla, regained the top spot later in the day. But as AP noted, the episode highlighted how AI-driven optimism is reshaping wealth dynamics among tech leaders.Oracle’s resurgence positions it as a critical enabler of global AI adoption.By providing high-performance, reliable cloud infrastructure, the company is not just fuelling chatbot development but also supporting applications in robotics, pharmaceuticals, finance, and automation.

Market watch: Asian stocks rally on Fed cut hopes; oil prices dip on demand concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-watch-asian-stocks-rally-on-fed-cut-hopes-oil-prices-dip-on-demand-concerns/articleshow/123842554.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)





Asian stock markets climbed strongly on Friday, extending a rally that has lifted Wall Street to fresh records, as investors grew confident the US Federal Reserve will deliver an interest rate cut next week.At the same time, oil prices slipped amid signs of softer demand and rising global supply.The buoyant mood in equities has been fuelled by recent US inflation and employment figures, which investors say have cleared the path for the central bank to ease policy.According to news agency AFP, jobless claims in the United States hit a four-year high last week, while August payrolls data showed just 22,000 jobs were added. Revised numbers also indicated employment growth in the year through March was more than 900,000 lower than earlier estimated.Inflation, meanwhile, held steady at around 3 per cent. Prices in August rose slightly faster than in July but were broadly in line with expectations, easing fears that US President Donald Trump’s tariffs would trigger a sharp spike.Taylor Nugent, senior economist for markets at National Australia Bank, was quoted as saying by AFP, “Inflation is not getting closer to the Fed’s target, but… as labour market concerns grow more pressing, fears (that) price pressures will be persistent fade.There is nothing to stand in the way of Fed cuts this year.”Traders are now almost certain the Fed will reduce borrowing costs by 25 basis points, though some speculate on a larger move. As per AFP, Chris Weston of Pepperstone said, “The base case is a 25-basis-point cut backed by a commitment to ease further in the meetings ahead,” while cautioning that a 50-point reduction remains unlikely.Reflecting the optimism, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index surged about 1.5 per cent, powered by nearly seven per cent gains in Alibaba after the e-commerce giant boosted its AI investment plans and pledged more spending on its core business.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.7 per cent to 44,694.65, while markets in Seoul, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Taipei and Manila also advanced, AFP noted.In contrast, oil prices edged lower, extending heavy losses from the previous session. Brent crude fell 30 cents, or 0.45 per cent, to $66.07 a barrel, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate slipped 31 cents, or 0.5 per cent, to $62.06, news agency Reuters reported.Both contracts had already shed between 1.7 and 2 per cent on Thursday.The downturn followed the International Energy Agency’s projection that global supply will grow faster than expected this year, owing to planned output hikes by OPEC and its allies. OPEC, however, left its 2025 and 2026 demand forecasts unchanged, citing resilient economic growth.As per Reuters, Saudi Arabia’s exports to China are set to climb to 1.65 million barrels per day in October, up sharply from September’s 1.43 million bpd, as Riyadh seeks to regain market share.Meanwhile, Russia plans to scale back ESPO Blend shipments from Kozmino port next month.Analysts said the mix of Fed-driven optimism and energy-market caution highlights the balancing act facing investors heading into the central bank’s policy meeting next week.","Asian stock markets climbed strongly on Friday, extending a rally that has lifted Wall Street to fresh records.

India-US Trade Deal Linked to Russian Oil: Donald Trump Envoy Sergio Gor Hints at Reset in Relations





: US ambassador-designate to India Sergio Gor on Thursday said Washington and New Delhi are ""not that far apart” on tariff issues and indicated an agreement between the two sides is imminent. The upbeat assessment came even as he, along with top officials and lawmakers, talked up long-term strategic ties between the two countries that have been rocked by differences over trade matters.At a confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Gor disclosed that President Trump has invited India’s commerce and trade ministers to visit US and they will be meeting with USTR Jamieson Greer in Washington next week. ""Part of that will include hopefully a deal. We are not that far apart right now... In fact, they're negotiating the nitty gritty of a deal,” Gor said.At a broader level, Gor and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who unusually dropped by at the hearing to introduce ambassadorial nominees, tamped down on talk of a rupture in ties because of the protracted tariff dispute, asserting that ""India is among America’s TOP relationships for shaping the world’s future.”""The story of the 21st century will be written in the Indo-Pacific. It’s so important that we have changed the name of the combatant command (from Asia-Pacific)...India is at the core of that,” Rubio said in his remarks, challenging reports, based on draft of the upcoming National Defense Strategy, that the Trump administration is dialing down commitments in the region in favor of a more isolationist posture.Gor also said President Trump remained committed to the Quad partnership with India, Japan, and Australia, without offering a firm date committment that the US President would visit the next Quad meeting, scheduled to be held in India later this year.He also spoke of the “deep friendship” Trump has with PM Modi saying it was “something unique.""""In fact, if you have noticed, when he has gone after other nations, he tends to go after their leaders for putting us in that position, and for the United States imposing those tariffs. When the President has been critical of India, he has gone out of his way to compliment Prime Minister Modi, they have an incredible relationship,” he said.PM Modi was conspicuously cool about Trump’s recent remarks on their personal friendship, emphasizing friendship between the two countries after the US President slapped punitive tariff amounting to sanctions against India for buying Russian oil.In fact, asked by Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen why India had copped tariff penalty and China had escaped it despite buying more Russian oil, Gor proffered the following explanation: “We hold our friends to different standards. Frankly, we expect more from India than we do sometimes from other nations.”There was no indication at any point during the hearing that Washington would ease pressure on New Delhi on the Russian oil issue despite all the upbeat sentiments about enhancing strategic ties. In fact, SFRC Chair Jim Risch, a Republican from Idaho, with a population less than that of a middling Indian city, told Gor that he must impress on India that the US ""will not tolerate support for Putin’s war machine.”Still, as several lawmakers expressed concern over the recent SCO summit where they perceived the leaders of Russia, China, and India getting close, Gor repeatedly asserted that the US and India had a lot more in common than they had with Russia or China.“If confirmed, I will ensure they (India) are pulled in our direction, not away from us,” he told lawmakers, some of whom spoke of his closeness to Trump and his direct access to the President.","US ambassador-designate to India Sergio Gor said Washington and New Delhi are ""not that far apart” on tariff issues.

Wall Street traded near record highs on Thursday as fresh US economic data reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week to support growth.The S&P 500 rose 0.3% in early trade after setting new records in the last two sessions, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 95 points and the Nasdaq composite added 0.4%, AP reported. Treasury yields stayed steady, signalling calm after the latest economic reports.Markets were buoyed by anticipation of a Fed rate cut, even as inflation remains above the 2% target and labour market data continues to show weakness.“Traders were already convinced the Fed will deliver its first cut to interest rates of the year at its next meeting, but they need inflation data until then to be mild enough not to derail those expectations,” analysts noted.Wall Street is betting the US economy can manage a “soft landing” — slowing enough to prompt monetary easing, but not collapsing into recession. An encouraging sign came from Wednesday’s wholesale inflation report, which showed price growth unexpectedly slowed in August.Among individual stocks, Opendoor jumped 36% after naming Shopify COO Kaz Nejatian as its new chief executive, with co-founders Keith Rabois and Eric Wu returning to the board.FedEx slipped 1.3% and UPS fell 2.1% after Bank of America downgraded both companies.In global markets, Europe’s major indexes gained at midday, with Germany’s DAX up 0.3%, Britain’s FTSE 100 advancing 0.5%, and France’s CAC 40 climbing 0.9%.In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 surged 1.2% to 44,372.50, with SoftBank Group rallying 8.3% for a second straight day. Japan’s producer prices rose 2.7% year-on-year in August, up from 2.5% the prior month. China’s Shanghai Composite jumped 1.7% to 3,875.31, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dipped 0.4% to 26,086.32.

The European Central Bank (ECB) kept its benchmark deposit rate steady at 2% on Thursday, with inflation back under control and the eurozone economy showing resilience despite US President Donald Trump’s tariff measures.At the post-decision news conference, attention is expected to focus on ECB President Christine Lagarde’s remarks on France’s fiscal crisis and whether the bank could step in if market turmoil deepens due to the country’s rising deficit and political deadlock, AP reported.The ECB’s move comes as the US Federal Reserve signals the possibility of a rate cut at its September 17 meeting. Eurozone growth held at 0.1% in the second quarter, avoiding recession despite tariff disruptions, while S&P Global’s purchasing managers’ survey for August stood at 51.1, indicating expansion.Inflation in the eurozone was 2.1% in August, close to the ECB’s target. Having raised rates sharply between 2021 and 2023 to curb inflation, the bank has since lowered them as growth concerns mounted. Analysts believe another cut could follow in the coming months.The European Commission has also eased trade tensions by capping US tariffs on European goods at 15%, higher than pre-Trump levels but below the steeper rates initially threatened.France’s fiscal deficit, at 5.8% of GDP last year, has pushed up borrowing costs, fuelling market unease. Lagarde faces the challenge of signalling readiness to act in case of panic without suggesting that the ECB would bail out governments unwilling to rein in deficits.","The European Central Bank (ECB) kept its benchmark deposit rate steady at 2% on Thursday.

"US inflation data: Consumer prices rise to 2.9% in August, core inflation hits 3.1%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-data-consumer-prices-rise-to-2-9-in-august-core-inflation-hits-3-1/articleshow/123831865.cms,"



US consumer inflation rose to 2.9% in August, its highest since January, as prices of gas, groceries and airfares jumped, according to the Labor Department. The figures come just ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, where policymakers are expected to cut interest rates despite persistent price pressures.The consumer price index (CPI) was up from 2.7% in July, while core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy costs, held steady at 3.1%. Both readings remain above the Fed’s 2% target. On a monthly basis, inflation quickened to 0.4% in August from 0.2% in July, with gas prices up 1.9%, grocery costs up 0.6% and airfares surging 5.9%, AP reported.The inflation print is the last major data point before the Fed’s two-day meeting beginning Tuesday, where officials are widely expected to lower the benchmark rate from 4.3% to about 4.1%. But the central bank is in a difficult position, balancing stubborn inflation with clear signs of labour market weakness.The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% in August, while jobless claims rose sharply by 27,000 to 263,000 — the highest in nearly four years. “Consumer inflation came in mildly hotter than forecast, but not nearly high enough to prevent the Fed from starting to cut rates next week,” Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist for Nationwide, told AP.“The labour market is losing steam and reinforces that the Fed needs to start cutting rates next week and that it will be the start of a series of rate reductions. ”Economists said rising layoffs and slowing hiring reinforce the case for monetary easing. Yet inflationary pressures — partly driven by President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imports — could restrain the Fed from cutting rates aggressively.Prices of clothing, furniture, appliances and rentals all rose in August, while hotel room tariffs were up 2.3%. Food costs continued to climb, with tomatoes, apples and beef leading the gains.The latest inflation data has also added to political tensions. Trump, who has pushed for deeper cuts, recently attempted to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, though a court blocked the move and allowed her to retain her position while the case proceeds.Businesses large and small are grappling with higher costs. Raleigh-based restaurant owner Cheetie Kumar said her input prices are up 10% from last year, with coffee costs tripling and spices doubling. “Those are things I cannot source locally … I don’t know any nutmeg growers in North Carolina,” she said.Cosmetics maker E.L.F. said it raised prices by $1 earlier this year, but CFO Mandy Fields admitted last month it is unclear if that will be enough to offset tariff costs. Retailers such as Home Depot and Macy’s have described their price hikes as modest, though Walmart has warned of further increases as inventories are replenished.","Consumer price index (CPI) was up from 2.7% in July.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Millennials, also known as Generation Y, are people born between 1981 and 1996. This means, currently their age range is between 28 to 43 years old, precisely.Diwali signifies the start of Samvat 2082 , the start of the new year, making it an auspicious opportunity for millennials to begin their new investing habits.Based on the age group mentioned above, millennials can be categorized into two segments based on their age groups: one is less than 30 years old, and the other is in their late 30s or early 40s. These two groups are in two different stages of their lives; the first category will have different aspirations or goals to achieve, and they will be focused on consumption-oriented goals like purchasing a house, covering marriage expenses, purchasing a car, etc.They will be in an acquisition stage and also moving towards planning for wealth creation . The other category will have achieved most of their aspirations in life and will be looking forward to wealth generation and retirement planning.Millennials typically have a bucket of regular expenses like living expenses, travel expenses, child education expenses, EMIs, rental costs, etc. The key to addressing these challenges is budgeting, where one can set up basic expense percentages like income to expenses should be less than 50%, EMI expenses should be 20 to 25%, and investment portion should be at least 25%; anything above this could be a best. This broad diversification of budgeting helps you to improve financial discipline and meet your obligations comfortably.Diwali is a very common time when individuals get bonuses from their respective organizations, and this lump sum amount can be prudently used towards savings and partially towards celebrations.Apart from this setting goals forms an important aspect and such as creating a basket for each goal, such as short-term goals like paying off small debts and taking a domestic holiday vacation. Medium-term goals like purchasing a car or going on a holiday trip to a dream destination. Long-term goals like retirement planning, purchasing a house, and generational wealth.As we enter this auspicious period, it’s essential to balance your portfolio by including both growth and defensive assets. Equity and real estate are seen as growth-oriented, while gold and debt are considered defensive assets. But each investment option carries a degree of risk; investors can manage those by understanding the underlying risks of each investment option.Investing exclusively in debt products can lead to zero real returns in an inflationary environment, making it essential to pair them with growth assets like equities, which can yield 12-14% returns over the long term. While gold has not consistently outperformed in all five-year timeframes, making it less reliable as a defensive asset compared to debt, real estate has notably underperformed, with most of the properties in urban cities failing to outperform Nifty 50 returns along with liquidity issues.In an asset mix, the primary consideration should be investing across the assets that are low-correlated to each other, like equity and debt. This approach will help to reduce volatility.For instance, an investor Rahul invested a 10 lakhs FD 10 years ago, which had an interest rate of around 6.5%, which helped him a corpus of 18 lakhs, but if he had invested the same in the asset mix of equity and debt, in the same period he could have generated more than 33 lakhs, which is significantly substantial.Thus , diversifying across the asset classes is key to reducing volatility and enhancing overall portfolio stability.Investors can take exposure to equity through multiple options like direct equity, PMS, AIF, and equity MF. However, among all equity, MF is the best choice as it offers diversification and professional management with expertise fund managers, which makes it a cost-effective option to take exposure in equities.These products that offer fixed returns of 6 to 8%, investors have various avenues to invest, such as FDs, debt MFs, PFs, arbitrage funds, etc.No one can predict an unexpected emergency crisis that could be like your medical expenses or any other unexpected expenditure, so having a safety net consisting of your next 6 months to 1 year expenses in liquid corpus helps you to avoid disturbing your investment account for an emergency crisis.Investing during Diwali presents a wonderful opportunity to align your financial goals with the spirit of the season. By considering a well-bounded investment strategy,millennials can create a diversified portfolio, which would keep the darkness away from your portfolio and keep it shining. Investors should also remember to diversify their investments across the asset classes.By following these steps, investors can make informed decisions that lead to sustainable wealth growth and financial security.","Millennials typically have a bucket of regular expenses like living expenses, travel expenses, child education expenses, EMIs, rental costs, etc. The key to addressing these challenges is budgeting, where one can set up basic expense percentages like income to expenses should be less than 50%.

Top Performing Silver ETFs

Gold vs Silver buying: Silver presents an attractive option for aggressive investors seeking portfolio diversification and alpha generation beyond traditional equities, believe analysts. Despite the recent surge in domestic prices, which saw silver reach the Rs 1 lakh per kg mark, analysts suggest that investors consider allocating 3-5% of their portfolio to the white metal by buying on dips over the next 1-3 months.Since the beginning of the calendar year 2024, silver has experienced impressive gains, rising by 33.65% to touch the Rs 1 lakh per kg mark. In the past month alone, it has gained 12.5%, outperforming the Nifty 50 index, which returned 12.5% during the calendar year but lost 5.6% over the past month.In dollar terms, silver's performance has been even more remarkable, with gains of 47.25% and 13.56%, respectively, over the same periods.Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, AVP-Research and Advisory at Master Capital Services, attributes the increasing market value of silver to its extensive use in various industries.""Silver is extensively utilised in electronics, solar panels, batteries, and increasingly in semiconductors, making it a critical component in modern technology. The growing industrial demand for silver along with the anticipation of another rate cut by the Federal Reserve is causing an increase in the metal's market value,” he told ET.Also Read | Silver better than gold for investment? Silver prices cross Rs 1 lakh mark! Manav Modi, a bullion analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, highlights the factors supportingsilver prices , including ""Rising industrial demand, high domestic imports, ETF buying by investors and Fed rate cuts have been supportive for silver.""While acknowledging the possibility of profit-booking following the sharp rally, Modi advises investors to view major dips as buying opportunities. He projects that silver could reach Rs 1.25 lakh per kg over the next 12 months.As advancements in technology continue and the need for electronic devices and semiconductors grows, the demand for silver is expected to remain strong, leading to a sustained upward trend in prices.Bhavesh Jain, co-head of Hybrid and Solutions Funds at Edelweiss Asset Management, stated, ""Silver has seen a strong long-term bullish break; the trend could likely continue supported by lower rates for longer and the revival in Chinese industrial activity."" Jain suggests that investing in silver ETFs is a more convenient option for investors compared to purchasing physical silver.Also Read | Looking to beat fixed deposit returns? Here’s what investors can consider instead of FD However, some fund managers believe that the long-term prospects of silver will be influenced by the adoption and adherence to climate change and green technology initiatives by major global economies.Vikram Dhawan, head of commodities and fund manager at Nippon India Mutual Fund, explained, ""If investors believe in Earth's rising temperature problem and its consequences, silver can serve as a proxy hedge.""Nirav Karkera, head of research at Fisdom, advises, ""Aggressive investors could buy on every fall and allocate 5-15% of their portfolio to the white metal.""Dhawan pointed out that in the short term, silver prices may be affected by a Republican victory in the US, as Donald Trump is not known for his environmentalist stance and instead favors fossil fuels.Considering the anticipated volatility, the upcoming US elections, and uncertainty regarding further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, wealth managers recommend that investors consider staggering their silver purchases.","Since the beginning of calendar year 2024, silver has experienced impressive gains, rising by 33.65%.

(AI image)

Should you buy gold this Dhanteras 2024 ? Dhanteras, a day considered auspicious for purchasing gold, is being celebrated in India today on October 29, 2024.. Despite a 30% surge in the yellow metal's price since the previous Dhanteras, investing at current levels may still be a wise choice, feel experts, and investors have various options to consider.Experts believe that investing in gold will yield attractive returns in the future, despite the rally over the past year.According to an ET report, Anuj Gupta from HDFC Securities recommends buying gold around Rs 75,500–76,000 and accumulating on dips in the range of Rs 73,500–73,700, with a price target of Rs 85,300–87,000 until the next Dhanteras. He says the stop loss should be at around Rs 71,500 level.“We expect that investing in gold will reap benefits in the future and it will provide attractive returns notwithstanding the rally in the past one year. Geopolitical and economic uncertainties, significant global ETF inflows, dovish monetary policy by western central bankers, the US election, and a lower dollar index continue will support the bullish trend in gold,” he was quoted as saying.Ventura Securities sees an upside to Rs 85,700 per 10 grams in gold, with support at Rs 77,000, while silver prices may reach Rs 1,06,000 to Rs 1,20,000, with support at Rs 95,500.However, investors with a short-term view should be cautious, as prices may subside after the sharp uptick. Amit Goel from Pace 360 expects gold prices to decline over the next few months before resuming their long-term bull run, as the asset class is currently overheated.Investors have several options for buying gold, including physical gold (jewellery, bars, and coins), gold ETFs , gold SIPs, digital gold, and gold futures.Prathamesh Mallya from Angel One calls gold a ""portfolio diversifier for investors"" and suggests it could be a substitute for equities in the near to medium term for less risk-averse investors.While the demand for gold jewellery during Dhanteras and Diwali 2024 may be under pressure due to record-high prices, jewellers expect demand to persist, particularly due to the ongoing wedding season and the cultural significance of gold during these festivals. Consumers may gravitate towards lightweight jewellery and coins, though volume-based demand may struggle.Gold ETFs have seen significant growth in India over the past four years, with investors increasingly inclined to invest in gold via the mutual fund route. Vishal Jain from Zerodha Fund House highlights the advantages of gold ETFs, including high purity, secure storage, full insurance, and the flexibility and cost-efficiency of ETFs.Gold SIPs and digital gold are also viable options for investors looking to regularly invest in gold without the need for physical storage.However, experts advise against investing in Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) at the moment, as they are trading at a premium and may experience lower liquidity.","Dhanteras, a day considered auspicious for purchasing gold, is being celebrated in India today on October 29, 2024.

(AI image)

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

DA hike calculator : PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has approved a 3% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) for central government employees on October 16, 2024. Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%. As a result of this latest hike, the DA and DR now stand at 53% for both central government employees and pensioners respectively. This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%. This rise in DA will lead to an increase in the take-home salary of central government employees starting from October 2024.The effective date for the increased DA and DR is July 1, 2024. The central government typically revises these allowances twice a year, in January and July, with official announcements being made at a later date.

He is survived by his wife Thankam, son Ajit Nambiar, daughter Anju, and son-in-law Rajeev Chandrasekhar , former Union minister who had built the BPL Mobile brand.The company's first products included precision measuring instruments such as hermetic sealed panel meters for Bharat Electronics as a subcontract for the Indian Army.

A truly visionary and a patriotic business leader,"" a close associate of the family told TOI.Given his desire to build quality products, Nambiar at different points had collaborations with Japanese companies for electrocardiographs, patient-monitoring systems and paper copiers. The Asian Games of 1982 motivated Nambiar to expand the business from the medical equipment sector to consumer electronics. The company entered into a partnership with Japan's Sanyo. Over the years, BPL became a household name in TVs and other electronic products. The company roped in Amitabh Bachchan for a campaign called 'Believe in the best' that further solidified the brand.However, by the early 2000s, BPL was on a declining track, partly on account of the aggressive investments by LG and Samsung, and BPL's investments in areas unrelated to its core business that just weren't paying off. By then, Nambiar had handed over the reins to Ajit. Rajeev Chandrasekhar, meanwhile, had succeeded separately in building the BPL Mobile brand, and he sold that to Hutchison Essar in 2005 for over $1 billion.""Shri TPG Nambiar Ji was a pioneering innovator and industrialist, who was a strong votary of making India economically strong.

It jumped 10 basis points this month. The markets will be closed on Friday for Diwali. Yields had declined in early Oct after RBI eased its policy stance to 'neutral', prompting expectations that rate cuts could start as soon as Dec. However, those hopes were dimmed a few days later after RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said it would be very premature to cut rates at this stage, a thought policymakers largely echoed, as the minutes of their meeting showed last week.""The start of rate cuts will be delayed to Feb 2025 on the assumption of fading supply distortions,"" said Radhika Rao, a senior economist at DBS Bank. On the contrary, local yields tracked the sharp spike in US Treasury yields this month - the 10-year yield has risen nearly 50 bps to 4.28% - as strong economic data dulled hopes of aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts. Traders have priced in a 94% probability of a 25-bps cut next week and now expect only two 25-bps cuts in the three meetings from Dec to March, versus four earlier.The jump in yields, however, was tempered by value buying, especially by state-run banks that net bought nearly $5 billion in bonds from the secondary market this month, per clearing house data.

This amount includes the unfair notional gain made by UPL which was disgorged, the interest on the gain and also the penalty for violating Sebi rules.This relates to a case in 2006 when Shroff used UPL's Mauritius-based subsidiary Bio-Win Corp to float an entity named Tulippe Universal.

MUMBAI: The rupee ended near an all-time low against the dollar on Thursday amid outflows from equities and anxiety over the outcome of the US election, but RBI 's intervention kept the local currency in a narrow range through Oct.The rupee closed at 84.08 against the US dollar , nearly unchanged from its close on Wednesday. Indian currency market will remain closed on Friday for a public holiday. The currency briefly hit a record low of 84.1 in Friday's session. In Oct, the rupee fell 0.3% and moved in a range of 83.79 to 84.1. RBI's relentless intervention has limited the rupee's fall and helped it outperform against major Asian peers ahead of the US presidential election on Nov 5. RBI sold dollars on almost all days in the last two weeks to ensure a measured depreciation of the rupee. A win for Republican candidate Donald Trump could spark a rally in the dollar index, lift US Treasury yields and undermine Asian currencies.RBI is well-equipped to deal with a potential sudden outflow of foreign funds and any steep fall in the rupee if Trump wins the US presidential election, Reuters reported. The central bank's defence of the rupee could, however, leave importers and exporters complacent to rising risks in the global markets, analysts said.","The rupee closed at 84.08 against the US dollar, nearly unchanged from its close on Wednesday.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay.That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office. The final decision will be made closer to the date when the Finance Bill reply is to be presented in Parliament, the reports said.Industry groups are expected to submit formal proposals to the finance ministry in the near future.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.","The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year.

Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit.

MUMBAI: The stock market ended Samvat year 2080 (that follows one of the Indian calendars) on Thursday on a negative note with the sensex down 553 points at 79,389 points, near its three-month low level. On the NSE , Nifty closed lower, at 24,205 points, down 136 points.The closing month of the year saw strong selling by foreign funds that shaved off about 6% from each of the leading indices. This, however, was in contrast to the gains in the stock market that also created wealth at unprecedented pace. Consider this: Since last Diwali (the day Samvat year starts) on Nov 12, investors' wealth in India has jumped Rs 128 lakh crore (about $1.5 trillion at current exchange rate) to Rs 453 lakh crore. This made Samvat 2080 the biggest wealth-creating year on record.The gains came on the back of a stable govt at the centre, smart handling of the inflationary scenario despite geopolitical uncertainties, strong macroeconomic fundamentals and record inflows by domestic funds which was at Rs 4.7 lakh crore. According to Shripal Shah, MD & CEO of Kotak Securities , despite the geopolitical concerns, domestic events like elections, a good monsoon, strong macro indicators and Sebi continuous efforts to protect investors have all contributed to a robust and promising market ecosystem. ""Notably, we've seen a surge of eager new investors keen to be part of India's growth story.""On Thursday, NSE, the country's leading bourse, said that its investor base had crossed 20 crore. And in the mutual fund sector while the total assets managed by the industry was at about Rs 68 lakh crore, monthly gross inflows through the systematic investment plan (SIP) route was nearing the Rs 25,000-crore mark. All the three numbers are at life-high levels. The year also saw gold, the most loved precious metal among Indians move to the second position in terms of annual returns. Compared to silver's 37% gain during the year, gold's was 33%.Among the popular investment opportunities, Bitcoin, with a return of 72% was the best-performing asset class. On the side of the returns spectrum, rupee and crude oil barely generated any return.

Consumer companies in India making everything from soaps to cars are sounding the alarm: the urban middle class continues to trim its spending for at least the second straight quarter as inflation and unemployment weigh on sentiment.At least seven of India's largest companies, including RIL's retail arm and consumer bellwether Hindustan Unilever , have flagged softer consumption demand and a challenging operating environment in their earnings for the July to Sept quarter.With post-pandemic euphoria fizzling out, higher interest rates, muted wage growth and poor job prospects are hurting urban demand. While India's rural consumers are showing signs of spending more thanks to a good monsoon season that boosted incomes in the countryside, it can't make up for the pullback among nearly 500 million city dwellers.Fault lines in the India consumption story bode ill for the global giants that have been relying on India's 1.4 billion strong consumer base to fuel growth amid an economic slowdown in China. Revenue from operations for Reliance's retail unit, India's largest retailer, slipped 3.5% for the quarter ended Sept 30 - a fall it attributed partly to weak demand for fashion and lifestyle products.Revival of rural demand, welcome as it is, cannot offset the shortfall in urban mass spending. For Unilever's India unit, smaller towns and villages make up only a third of its sales, CFO Ritesh Tiwari told reporters last week. Any recovery in demand growth was a few quarters away, he said. ""The pattern is quite clear that urban growth has trended down in recent quarters,"" Rohit Jawa, HUL's CEO, said after the maker of Dove soaps and Magnum ice-creams posted sluggish earnings.The slack is now feeding into India's growth forecasts although the country's central bank has shown no signs of relenting on calls for rate cuts.""Underlying demand conditions bear watching,"" India's finance ministry said in a report on Monday. Softening consumer sentiment was pointing to moderation in urban consumption, according to the report. The deceleration is showing up across sectors: Passenger vehicle sales fell for two months straight in September, while air travel has declined three out of the four months since June. India's factory activity has been softening since July, although it registered an uptick this month.""Companies are scaling down their salary outlays,"" Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi, economists at Nomura Holdings Inc. wrote in an Oct. 28 report. Firms are lowering their cost of wages reflecting a mix of weaker nominal salary growth and a leaner workforce, they wrote. ""We believe this weakness in urban demand is likely to continue,"" Varma and Nandi wrote, explaining that the post-pandemic surge in pent-up demand has faded, monetary policy is tight and the central bank's crackdown on unsecured credit is hurting activity.","At least seven of India's largest companies have flagged softer consumption demand and a challenging operating environment.

The gruesome killing led to tension and a large police presence. Authorities have initiated a magisterial probe and assured the victim's family of strict action against the culprits.

VARANASI: Tension gripped Kabiruddinpur village in Uttar Pradesh 's Jaunpur district Wednesday morning when a 17-year-old boy was beheaded by his neighbours — who are also his relatives — in the wake of an almost three-decade-old property dispute pending in civil court for disposal.The teen, Anurag Yadav alias Chhotu, was a rising taekwondo player and the only child of his parents. He was a student of Raj Inter College and had won a bronze medal in the Indo-Nepal international taekwondo competition and a silver medal in a national open taekwondo event at Noida in recent months.Some villagers trailed bloodstains spread over several hundred metres and reached a field where the boy's beheaded body lay. The news spread like wildfire and hundreds of villagers gathered at the spot. Seeing Chhotu's mother cry with his head in her lap was heart-wrenching.A heavy police force was deployed in the village where district magistrate Dinesh Chandra and SP Ajay Pal Sharma camped for several hours to monitor the situation. The DM and SP ordered the suspension of a lekhpal, Jagdish Yadav, and a beat in-charge sub-inspector Harish Chandra in this connection, while action was recommended against revenue inspector Munnilal.The DM also ordered a magisterial probe into the matter, fixing three days for report submission. He said neither the assailants nor those who provoked the targeting of the teen in this dispute would be spared. The SP said an FIR was registered based on a complaint by Chhotu's family, adding that some suspects were detained for questioning and all accused would be arrested soon.Officials said the families of Chhotu and the accused had been embroiled in property disputes since 1995. Besides property dispute, other angles were also being investigated. The body was sent for postmortem.Timely police intervention and arrival of the DM and SP helped keep the situation under control. Both officials met Chhotu's father, Ramjit Yadav, assuring him of strict action against the guilty and all necessary assistance.","Teen, Anurag Yadav alias Chhotu, was a rising taekwondo player and the only child of his parents.

Bengal Launches Innovative Housing Scheme to Outshine PMAY With Greater Flexibility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bengal-launches-innovative-housing-scheme-to-outshine-pmay-with-greater-flexibility/articleshow/114742243.cms,"KOLKATA: Bengal govt's own rural housing scheme, which will grant eligible persons Rs 1.2 lakh in three tranches — a counter to Centre's Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana ( PMAY ) scheme — will make sure it covers a whole lot of citizens who have been rendered ineligible for the central grant because of Centre's strict eligibility criteria.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee discussed this issue in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, convened primarily to discuss the fallout of Cyclone Dana . Also present were panchayat minister Pradip Majumdar and agriculture minister Shobhandeb Chatterjee. Sources close to the developments said the scheme would not only include two-wheeler owners and those whose homes were partly made of concrete — these categories are ineligible for PMAY — but also fast-track applications from elderly citizens, people with disabilities, women-headed households and people whose homes suffered damage during natural disasters, including Cyclone Dana.State govt is expected to roll out the scheme by Dec-end to an estimated 12 lakh citizens, the sources indicated. Beneficiaries would include those who applied for PMAY funds but have not received the grant.Bengal govt and Centre have been in a deadlock over the non-release of PMAY funds in the state. While Centre alleges a lack of background checks in applications, Bengal has questioned Centre's intent, alleging it has been stalling funds for 11.3 lakh beneficiaries. The sources indicated that Bengal govt had decided to release funds from its own resources for those who failed to procure the PMAY grant, like it has been doing with NREGS beneficiaries.After the CM's meeting, panchayat secretary P Ulganathan held a separate meeting with district officials apprising them about the rules. Sources said it was decided that the grants could cover both reconstruction of damaged houses and for building new units. Technical support will be provided to ensure the houses have adequate disaster-resistant features. Panchayat bodies would have to set up help desks to assist beneficiaries with documentation and technicalities.The new norms would also include special provisions for residents in coastal areas and flood-prone zones. Local panchayats are expected to play a crucial role in identifying genuine beneficiaries and facilitating the application process. BDOs have been directed to conduct regular field visits to assess the ground situation while selecting beneficiaries.State govt also plans to integrate the housing scheme with other welfare programmes to provide comprehensive support to affected families. Panchayats and police would be involved in the monitoring process to ensure transparency and timely completion of homes. Govt will also set up a grievance redress mechanism to address complaints and concerns promptly, an official said.The focus of the CM's meeting was to streamline norms to provide housing assistance to victims of recent natural calamities, an official said. During the meeting, she reviewed damage caused by Dana and recent floods, which left many families homeless across several districts. She also asked Majumdar and Chatterjee to visit the districts to assess the extent of the damage caused to crops and houses by the cyclone.

""Any chancellor standing here today would face this reality, and any responsible chancellor would take action. That is why today I am restoring stability to our public finances and rebuilding our public services.""In a major move, Reeves increased the national insurance payroll tax for businesses by 1.2 percentage points to 15% from April 2025, while also reducing the threshold at which companies start paying the tax.

WASHINGTON: The US economy grew at a healthy 2.8% annual rate from July through September, with consumers helping drive growth despite the weight of still-high interest rates .Wednesday's report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product - the economy's total output of goods and services - did slow slightly from its 3% growth rate in the April-June quarter. But the latest figures still reflect surprising durability just as Americans assess the state of the economy in the final stretch of the presidential race.Consumer spending , which accounts for about 70% of US economic activity, accelerated to a 3.7% annual pace last quarter, up from 2.8% in the April-June period. Exports also contributed to the third quarter's growth, increasing at an 8.9% rate.On the other hand, growth in business investment slowed sharply on a drop in investment in housing and in nonresidential buildings such as offices and warehouses. But spending on equipment surged.Wednesday's report also contained some encouraging news on inflation. The Federal Reserve 's favored inflation gauge - called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE - rose at just a 1.5% annual pace last quarter, down from 2.5% in the second quarter and the lowest figure in more than four years. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.2%, down from 2.8% in the April-June quarter.The report is the first of three estimates the government will make of GDP growth for the third quarter of the year. The US economy has continued to expand in the face of the much higher borrowing rates the Fed imposed in 2022 and 2023 in its drive to curb inflation. Despite widespread predictions that the economy would succumb to a recession, it has kept growing, with employers still hiring and consumers still spending. And with inflation steadily cooling, the Fed has begun to cut interest rates.The report ""sends a clear message that the economy is doing well, and inflation is moderating - good news for the Federal Reserve,'' said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics.Within the GDP data, a category that measures the economy's underlying strength rose at a solid 3.2% annual rate from July through September, up from 2.7% in the April-June quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.Other recent economic reports have also pointed to a still-healthy economy. In a sign that the nation's households, whose purchases drive most of the economy, will continue spending, the Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index posted its biggest monthly gain since March 2021. The proportion of consumers who expect a recession in the next 12 months dropped to its lowest point since the board first posed that question in July 2022.At the same time, the nation's once-sizzling job market has lost some momentum. On Tuesday, the government reported that the number of job openings in the United States fell in September to its lowest level since January 2021. And employers have added an average of 200,000 jobs a month so far this year - a healthy number but down from a record 604,000 in 2021 as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession, 377,000 in 2022 and 251,000 in 2023.On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report that the economy added 120,000 jobs in October. That gain, though, will probably have been significantly held down by the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and by a strike at Boeing, the aviation giant, all of which temporarily knocked thousands of people off payrolls.Despite the continued progress on inflation, average prices still far exceed their pre-pandemic levels, which has exasperated many Americans and posed a challenge to Vice President Kamala Harris' prospects in her race against former President Donald Trump. Most mainstream economists have suggested, though, that Trump's policy proposals, unlike Harris', would worsen inflation.At its most recent meeting last month, the Fed was satisfied enough with its progress against inflation - and concerned enough by the slowing job market - to slash its benchmark rate by a hefty half percentage point, its first and largest rate cut in more than four years. When it meets next week, the Fed is expected to announce another rate cut, this one by a more typical quarter-point.The central bank's policymakers have also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate again at their final two meetings this year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. The cumulative result of the Fed's rate cuts, over time, will likely be lower borrowing rates for consumers and businesses.","US economy grew at a healthy 2.8% annual rate from July through September.

Global gold demand reaches record high value of over $100 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-gold-demand-reaches-record-high-value-of-over-100-billion/articleshow/114773746.cms,"Global gold demand reaches record high value of over USD 100 billion

NEW DELHI: Total global gold demand surged to an unprecedented high of over USD 100 billion in the third quarter of 2024, marking a significant milestone in the precious metal's market history, according to World Gold Council .According to the Q3 2024 Gold Demand Trends report, total gold demand increased by 5 per cent year-on-year, reaching 1,313 tonnes, driven by robust investment in a record-high price environment.Investment demand for gold skyrocketed, more than doubling from the previous year to 364 tonnes. This surge was primarily fueled by a shift in demand for gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) among Western investors, with global gold ETFs adding 95 tonnes--a notable rebound as this marked the first positive quarter since Q1 2022.Despite a 9 per cent decline in bar and coin demand, the year-to-date total remains strong at 859 tonnes, significantly higher than the 10-year average of 774 tonnes.Central bank purchases showed a slowdown in Q3 but remained healthy, with demand totaling 186 tonnes. Year-to-date central bank demand reached 694 tonnes, aligning with figures from the same period in 2022. Gold prices continued their upward trajectory during the quarter, averaging US$2,474 per ounce. This rise, however, tempered global demand for gold jewelry, which fell by 12 per cent year-on-year in volume. Nevertheless, the value of jewelry consumption increased by 13 per cent, indicating that consumers are willing to spend more for smaller quantities of gold products.Technological demand for gold also saw growth, rising 7 per cent year-on-year, particularly supported by advancements in the electronics sector amid the ongoing AI boom.The total supply of gold increased by 5 per cent compared to the previous year, driven by a 6 per cent rise in mine production and an 11 per cent increase in recycling efforts.Louise Street, Senior Markets Analyst at the World Gold Council, commented, ""Q3 saw increased investment and over-the-counter activity prop up global gold demand and drive price performance.""He added, ""While the higher gold price dampened demand in the majority of consumer markets, the import duty cut in India kept jewellery and bar and coin demand remarkably high in a record-breaking price environment.""

WASHINGTON: US job openings tumbled last month to their lowest level since January 2021, a sign that the labor market is losing some momentum. Still, posted vacancies remain well above pre-pandemic levels.The Labor Department reported Tuesday that the number of job openings dropped to 7.4 million in September from 7.9 million in August. Economists had expected the level of openings to be virtually unchanged. Job openings fell in particular at healthcare companies and at government agencies at the federal, state and local levels.The number of layoffs also rose. And the number of Americans who quit their jobs fell below 3.1 million, the fewest since August 2020.""Workers (are) not as confident as they have been about being able to find a job if they quit without another to step into,″ Carl Weinberg and Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics wrote in a commentary. Still, they added, ""there is no signal here of any sudden collapse of the labor market here or any imminent recession. The labor market is softer, sure, but it is not imploding.""Though job openings have fallen sharply since peaking at 12.2 million in 2022, they remain higher than they were before the coronavirus pandemic paralyzed the American economy in early 2020. When the economy roared back with unexpected strength from the COVID-19 recession, companies scrambled to find enough workers to keep up with customer orders.The overheating economy caused an outburst of inflation, and theFederal Reserve responded by raising its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has plummeted from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.4%.The economy proved surprisingly resilient in the face of the Fed hikes, dodging a widely forecast recession. Compared with a surge in hiring from 2021 through 2023, though, job creation has slowed this year - to an average of 200,000 new jobs a month from January through September this year. That is healthy though down from a record average of 604,000 jobs a month in 2021 at the end of pandemic lockdowns, 377,000 in 2022 and 251,000 last year.Still, employers did add an unexpectedly strong 254,000 jobs in September. On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report that the economy added 120,000 jobs in October, a total that will likely be held down by the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and a strike at Boeing. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at a low 4.1%, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.","The number of job openings dropped to 7.4 million in September from 7.9 million in August.

Investors are looking for the next big breakout stars as the cryptocurrency market prepares for a potential surge. Five cryptos , Rexas Finance , Sui , Chainlink , Solana , and Litecoin , are set to skyrocket this November. Smart investors should keep an eye on these coins as they exhibit indications of a notable increase in line with the current market momentum.Rexas Finance's novel approach to the real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation has garnered the project's rapid attention in the market. The project has achieved a significant milestone with $4 million raised in its Stage 4 presale. Real estate, artwork, and other tangible assets can be tokenized with Rexas Finance, releasing liquidity and giving investors access to illiquid markets.Rexas Finance has several important features, such as a no-code Token Builder that makes it easier to create NFTs and utility tokens and a QuickMint Bot that allows tokenization over major chat platforms instantly. Additionally, its AI Shield inspects smart contracts to improve security and ensure the platform's safety. Investor trust has increased after the platform's recent CoinMarketCap listing, which increased token performance transparency. The current $1 million giveaway adds to the enthusiasm surrounding Rexas Finance. Twenty winners will receive $50,000 worth of RXS apiece. As November approaches, investors will be closely watching the token price rise to $0.070 during the next presale stage, with a public launch listing price of $0.20.Sui's increasing Total Value Locked (TVL), which has risen by 260% since August and reached $1.49 billion, has helped it gain popularity. Sui's bullish channel pattern indicates that the token may see a 22.9% price surge to $2.6 as the cryptocurrency market continues to trend upward. Expectations of additional expansion have been fueled by the SUI Foundation's recent clarification on insider selling claims, further enhancing investor faith. Sui, now trading at $2.04, is set up for an upward breakout, making it a strong contender in November.Recent upgrades to the ecosystem have given Chainlink (LINK) a positive momentum and demonstrated tremendous potential. The introduction of Secure Mint, the growth of the data oracle, and the staking feature of LINK have all helped to drive up the price of the cryptocurrency, which is currently trading at $11.53. With increased on-chain activity and declining exchange reserves, the market is becoming more bullish, and the token may soon overcome its $13 resistance level. It could spark a surge to new highs in the upcoming weeks if LINK is able to break through current resistance.As it gets ready to introduce Firedancer, a new high-performance validator that will speed up the blockchain's transaction processing, Solana (SOL) has continued to develop steadily. Solana has gained 2% as of late, trading at $153.82, as the community excitedly awaits the mainnet launch in early 2025. Momentum indications point to a potential gain of around 11% for SOL, with the $169.43 resistance level as the goal. The ecology and long-term profit potential of the Solv Protocol is further strengthened by the recent introduction of its Bitcoin staking token on Solana.Recently, Litecoin (LTC) broke all previous records by having its intraday trading volume hit $4 billion for the first time in 16 months. LTC's price has surged beyond $70, indicating significant purchasing demand. With a market capitalization of $5.45 billion, Litecoin has risen more than 10% in the previous week thanks to the wider crypto movement and growing acceptance by world payment networks. Analysts expect LTC to keep rising near the $100 threshold; hence, this coin is important to watch this November.November is already proving to be an interesting month for investors, with these five cryptocurrencies exhibiting clear indications of rapid growth. Particularly noteworthy is Rexas Finance, with its cutting-edge technology and quickly expanding business.

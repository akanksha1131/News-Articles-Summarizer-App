Nifty broke below its support of 25500 and completed both of its target of 25120/24950 on the downside before saving its neck above the 200 DMA on a closing basis yesterday. Given the swift price action and structure, Nifty is likely to unfold a bounce of up to 25500 odd ahead of the Union Budget day with support seen at Wednesday’s low of 24900 odd. Dips below the 25100 mark are likely to get bought into.Bank Nifty broke its 2 month rising trendline underperforming the Nifty after a repeated outperformance from the start of this month. The index has instead taken a polarity support on its age-old trendline rising from the lows in March 2020.However, Bank Nifty’s underperformance is unlikely to end unless it reclaims back above 59500 mark. For the short term a break above 58930 is likely to create a vacuum for buyers to head for 59270/59450.Having completed its bearish flag targets in yesterday’s trade, SWIGGY is back to its May 2025 breakout levels and possibility of a huge bounce is elevated at these levels. An 8-10% dead-cat bounce can play out given the price action seen on daily charts herewith.GAIL ended at a 9 month closing low early this week after witnessing repeated selling pressure ever since the gap down seen in the last week of November 2025. A retest of its March 2025 low is now likely to be seen on cards.After a 15 month trendline breakout seen at the start of the current calendar month, stock has been in sideways consolidation waiting for triggers. With mayhem witnessed in broader markets, FMCG basket could be the one seeing buying interest and hence a stock which has already broken out allows to read price action traces.","Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, says top buy calls for today are: Swiggy, Godrej Consumer Products and GAIL.

US Claims PM Modi ‘didn’t call’; MEA Rebuts

India-US trade deal: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that America would have a ‘great’ trade deal with India. Trump’s statement came during his visit to the World Economic Forum (WEF) being held at Davos in Switzerland.Speaking to Moneycontrol on the sidelines of the WEF where he delivered a speech, Trump praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and expressed confidence in an India-US trade deal. “I have great respect for your Prime Minister. He’s a fantastic man and a friend of mine. We are going to have a good deal,” Trump was quoted as saying.Trump’s remarks come at a time when the US has imposed 50% tariffs on India - among the highest in the world. While both countries have reiterated that trade talks and negotiations continue, a deal still remains elusive.Earlier this month, US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor assumed charge and expressed confidence in India-US ties. Gor voiced strong support for the ongoing trade negotiations, saying both countries are firmly committed to reaching an agreement.While describing the bond between Trump and PM Modi as genuine, Gor said the US president could visit India “hopefully in the next year or two”.He said the India-US relationship rests not only on shared interests but also on engagement at the highest political levels, adding that true partners may differ at times but ultimately resolve their disagreements.“Remember, India is the world's largest nation, so it's not an easy task to get this across the finish line, but we are determined to get there. And while trade is very important for our relationship, we will continue to work closely together on other very important areas such as security, counterterrorism, energy, technology, education, and health,” he added.Gor was generous in his praise of Modi, calling him an exceptional leader. “I was with the President…and as we had dinner right after New Year's, he recounted his incredible experience visiting here and also his great friendship with the great Prime Minister of India, Prime Minister Modi,” said Gor, who previously served as a close aide to Trump. “I've traveled all over the world with President Trump, and I can attest that his friendship with Prime Minister Modi is real,” he added.Earlier this month, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed that the India-US trade deal failed to materialise because PM Modi did not place a call to Trump. The Ministry of External Affairs, however, said the description of events was inaccurate and reaffirmed India’s willingness to pursue a trade pact that delivers benefits to both sides.Lutnick had said on a podcast that India had “missed the train” by not reaching out to Trump within a three-week window, unlike leaders from several other countries.Responding to the remarks, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India and the United States had been engaged in discussions on a bilateral trade agreement since February 13 last year and had repeatedly come close to finalising a deal.“We have seen the remarks. India and the US were committed to negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with the US as far back as Feb 13 last year… On several occasions, we have been close to a deal… We remain interested in a mutually beneficial trade deal between two complementary economies and look forward to concluding it,” he said.India and the US have held five rounds of official-level talks since negotiations began last February, alongside discussions at the ministerial level. Jaiswal also noted that Prime Minister Modi and President Trump had spoken by phone eight times in 2025, covering a broad range of issues linked to the bilateral partnership.",US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that America would have a ‘great’ trade deal with India.

Gold price prediction

today:

are touching new record highs due to heightened geopolitical tensions, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Here’s his outlook on gold prices:

Gold Performance:

In the week ending January 16, the spot gold surged nearly 2% to close at $4595. The rally in the week came on the heels of a sharp 4.6% rise in the week ending January 9.

Driven by safe haven demand as the US President on January 17 threatened 8 EU nations with 10% tariffs beginning February 1 in retaliation to their opposition to his Greenland plans, the yellow metal extended its rally to a fresh record high of $4690 on January 19.

At the time of writing this article, the shiny metal was changing hands at $4672 (MCX February contract Rs 145,500), up 1.67% for the day.

ETF and COMEX gold inventory:

As of January 16, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 99.86 MOz, highest since August 2022, and are up nearly 1% YTD, as holdings rose for the second straight week.

Registered COMEX gold inventory at 18.86 MOz, is up around 1 MOz from the cycle low of 17.86 MOz but is down over 22% from the record peak of 24.25 MOz seen on April 7.

The US Dollar Index fell around 0.15% to 99.08 on January 19 after rising for three straight weeks.Two-year and ten-year treasury yields jumped nearly 2% last week as the US President expressed doubt over the appointment of Kevin Hassett, a key proponent of lower rate policy. Trump wants to keep him at the White House.The US Bond market was closed on January 19 to observe Martin Luther King Jr Holiday.Trump rattled NATO allies over the weekend after threatening to impose 10% tariffs on 8 EU nations starting February 1 if he doesn’t get control of Greenland.Tariffs will be increased to 25% from June 1. The proposed tariff will be due and payable until a deal is reached for complete and total purchase of Greenland.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Europe was too weak to ensure Greenland’s security in an interview on Sunday.International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said it’s too early to gauge the economic impact of tensions over Greenland, though it could be a headwind for growth.EU ambassadors met on Sunday to discuss options if Trump follows through with his threats. They are considering €93 billion ($108 billion) worth of American goods. The bloc’s leaders are due to meet for an emergency summit on Thursday.The European Union is once again weighing whether to use its most powerful economic weapon — the anti-coercion instrument (ACI) — in a dispute with a major trading partner. The instrument allows the EU to deploy an array of measures in response to coercive trade tactics. It may include new fees on EU imports of US goods and services, curbs on US investments in Europe or a ban on American firms bidding for public contracts.The pending US Supreme Court ruling on some of Trump’s earlier tariffs may come as soon as Tuesday.President Trump will address the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week and may offer details of home ownership plans for helping Americans buy homes by making it possible to take money out of their 401(K)s and use that for downpayment.Bloomberg reported that respondents in a World Economic Forum survey identify 'geoeconomic confrontation' and 'state-based armed conflict' as the two biggest risks to the global backdrop in 2026.As per Axios, the US officials plan to focus on economic growth, home ownership and peace through strength at WEF, Davos.China’s data released on January 19 showed that China’s economy grew 4.5% on an annualized basis in Q4 2025 vs 4.4% expected. China’s retail sales hit a 3-year low in December, trailing the forecast. Similarly, China’s industrial production, fixed asset investment (December) trailed their respective forecasts.Last week’s data showed that US CPI (December), despite expectations of coming out to be hot on downward adjustments in the November CPI data, was tame. CPI y-o-y was up 2.7% (forecast 2.7%, prior 2.7%). The core CPI also rose 2.7% y-o-y (forecast 2.7%, prior 2.7%). Retail sales advance was up 0.6% m-o-m Vs the estimate of 0.5% and prior reading of -0.1%), while retail sales control group up 0.4% (forecast 0.4%, prior 0.6%).PPI final demand data were hotter than expected though.Industrial production data, released on Friday, was up 0.4% m-o-m (forecast 0.1%) in December.Major US data on the deck this week include 3Q GDP final reading (January 22), real personal spending (January 22), PCE Price Index (January 22) and S&P Global US PMIs, University of Michigan consumer sentiment and inflation expectations (January 23).Major Eurozone data to be released this week include CPI (January 19), services and composite PMIs (January 23). The UK’s CPI (January 21), services and composite PMIs (January 23) will also be monitored by investors.Fresh escalation in geopolitical tensions over Greenland as Trump threatens the EU nations with tariffs to achieve his goal is an unexpected development which is supporting gold prices. Heightened worries and repercussions may also affect global trade and economy. Otherwise, gold could have come under pressure due to diminishing possibility of Hassett becoming the next Fed Chair, a firmer US Dollar and thawing geopolitical tensions as Iran strike had been averted.Still, US Supreme Court ruling over Trump’s tariffs may create huge short-term volatility as his tariffs may be lacking legal basis, though the Trump Administration could resort to other clauses to keep most of the tariffs in place.Trump extending the EU tariff deadline will also weigh on the yellow metal.Spot gold may test resistance around $4750 (MCX February contract Rs 148,000) amid elevated US-EU tariff tensions.However, considering the risks involved, buyers are urged to exercise caution and to put suitable stoploss. Support is at $4608 (Rs 143,500)/$4560 (Rs 142,000). Interim resistance is at $4707 (Rs 146,500).Spot silver surged over 12% in the week ending January 16 as it closed at $89.94 on January 16.Shanghai Gold Exchange Silver price (T+D) at 23271 CNY/Kg is equivalent to around $104/Oz.US imposing tariffs on EU means that the expected flow of silver inventories from COMEX warehouses to LBMA warehouses will be disrupted, which will tighten the spot market.Spot silver, currently at $94.42 (MCX March contract Rs 309,660), up nearly 5% for the day, is expected to trade with a positive bias that will strengthen should the metal closes above $94 mark for two straight days. It may rise to test the resistance zone of $98-$100 (MCX March contract Rs 321,000-Rs 328,000). However, as mentioned earlier in the gold section, utmost caution is needed with a suitable stoploss in place. Support is at $90 (Rs 295,000)/$86 (Rs 282,000).","Gold prices touching new record highs due to heightened geopolitical tensions, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

How FM can simplify TCS to ease cash flow pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-fm-can-simplify-tcs-to-ease-cash-flow-pressure/articleshow/127052518.cms,"Evolution of TCS

TCS in a world of remittances abroad and big spends

Challenges for taxpayers

The balance required

In daily life, most people focus on how much tax they pay, but rarely on when and how it is collected. An increasingly visible part of India's tax ecosystem is tax collected at source (TCS), which requires a portion of tax to be collected upfront on certain transactions. For many taxpayers, the timing of this collection now matters as much as the final tax amount.TCS has existed for nearly four decades, evolving from a narrow anti-evasion measure into a tool for real time tax monitoring. Initially limited to high-risk sectors such as liquor, timber, tendu leaves, scrap and forest produce, it required a small tax collection at the point of sale to create a transaction trail. As the economy expanded and digital reporting improved, TCS was extended to high value purchases such as motor vehicles above Rs 10 lakh and later to foreign remittances and overseas tour packages, bringing everyday taxpayers into its ambit.To widen and deepen the tax net, the scope of TCS was extended in 2020 to include foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS).Individuals usually remit money abroad for education, medical treatment, overseas tours and other purposes such as gifts, donations, etc. TCS on LRS was introduced not as an additional tax but as an advance collection mechanism, adjustable against final tax liability.The Finance Act, 2025 responded to rising education and travel costs by raising the TCS threshold on LRS remittances from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per financial year and removing TCS on loan-funded overseas education. For self-funded education remittances above Rs 10 lakh, TCS now applies at 5%, reinforcing the intent to avoid burdening genuine education expenses.From April 22, 2025, TCS was also extended to select luxury goods such as watches, yachts, sunglasses, shoes and sportswear, reflecting higher spending in this segment. TCS at 1% applies only where the value of a single item exceeds Rs 10 lakh. Thus, a wristwatch priced at Rs 12 lakh attracts TCS, while two watches costing Rs 6 lakh each do not. The tax is collected at the point of sale and can be claimed as credit while filing the income tax return, enabling tracking of high value purchases without denying tax credit.A key concern with TCS is that even individuals with little or no final tax liability must pay it upfront and wait to claim a refund, resulting in blocked funds and cash flow strain.To address this for salaried taxpayers, changes effective Oct 1, 2024 allow TCS paid to be reported to employers through Form 12BAA, enabling adjustment against monthly tax deductions and easing cash flow pressure. Accurate disclosure of the amount, date and purpose of TCS is essential for this mechanism to work.While this relief benefits salary income earners, taxpayers earning non-salary income must still adjust TCS against advance tax or claim refunds at year end. For example, Kaushal, a self-employed consultant, remits Rs 75 lakh abroad under LRS for his child's education. The TCS collected cannot be adjusted immediately, forcing him to wait until return filing to recover a substantial sum.There are ways to improve this experience without compromising the system's intent. Faster refunds and better digital integration between TCS and TDS could ease cash flow pressures. TCS has strengthened India's tax reporting framework and with thoughtful fine-tuning, it can continue to meet its objectives while remaining responsive to taxpayers' needs. A balanced tax system works best when it ensures both transparency and convenience.(Karmakar is tax partner, EY India; Rajesh Sureshan, director at EY India, also contributed to the article.

Gold and silver prices surged to fresh record highs on Tuesday, extending gains from the previous session as renewed fears of a potential US–EU trade war drove investors towards safe-haven assets.The rally followed tariff threats by US President Donald Trump linked to opposition from European countries over his Greenland move, which has heightened global uncertainty, reported ET.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures for February 5, 2026, delivery rose Rs 1,300 or 1 per cent to Rs 1,46,988 per 10 grams, while silver futures for March 5, 2026, surged Rs 7,869 or 2.5 per cent to Rs 3,19,949 per kg, as per ET.In the international market, COMEX silver prices jumped to a fresh lifetime high of $94.74 per troy ounce during Asian trade, while gold hovered near record levels at around $4,670 per troy ounce.Prices later pared some gains after a sharp rally in the previous session, which had been triggered by Trump’s announcement of proposed tariffs on eight European countries opposing his Greenland move.Market sentiment has remained fragile amid fears of another trade standoff between the US and Europe.According to news agency AFP, silver touched $94.73 in Asian trade, while gold held just shy of its own record peak as risk aversion intensified across global markets.On the outlook, Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart said precious metals are witnessing elevated volatility but are expected to remain supported.“Silver is expected to hold its key support near $84 per troy ounce, while gold is likely to sustain support around $4,440 per troy ounce on a closing basis,” Jain said, as quoted by ET.He added that gold has international support in the $4,635–$4,610 range, with resistance at $4,700–$4,740, while silver is supported between $91.40 and $88, with resistance at $96.60–$98.80.On MCX, gold support is seen at Rs 1,44,800–Rs 1,44,100, with resistance at Rs 1,46,350–Rs 1,47,000, while silver support lies at Rs 3,03,000–Rs 2,96,600, and resistance at Rs 3,14,000–Rs 3,22,000.Jain said the strategy remains to buy gold and silver on dips, targeting Rs 1,48,000 for gold and Rs 3,22,000 for silver, with stop losses placed below Rs 1,44,000 for gold and Rs 2,98,000 for silver.","Rally followed tariff threats by US President Donald Trump linked to opposition from European countries over his Greenland move.

Rao denies charges, calls videos ‘fabricated’

Complaints to PMO, DoPT; audio clips add twist

Opposition ups pressure

Past controversies resurface







BENGALURU: Karnataka DGP (Civil Rights Enforcement) K Ramachandra Rao was suspended on Monday night after the state government ordered a probe into unverified sleaze videos allegedly showing the senior IPS officer in intimate acts with women inside his office.Chief minister Siddaramaiah said disciplinary action would follow a detailed inquiry.Read more: Karnataka DGP Ramachandra Rao under fire: 'Sleaze' video, suspension and shadow of Ranya Rao gold smuggling case — what we know “We will take action. No one is above the law, however senior the officer may be,” the CM said in Badami, adding that he became aware of the matter earlier in the day and had directed a probe.The suspension came hours after purported videos went viral on social media, triggering political outrage and a flurry of complaints to both state and central authorities. The source and authenticity of the videos remain unverified, and the state government said they would be examined as part of the inquiry.Rao rejected the allegations outright, calling the videos “fabricated, false and aimed at maligning me and scuttling my career”. He told reporters that his attempts to meet home minister G Parameshwara did not fructify and suggested the footage could relate to his posting in Belagavi nearly eight years ago.“I will consult my advocate and take appropriate legal action,” he said.The government has sought a report from the home department. Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar said he was unaware of the details and referred queries to the CM and the home minister.As the controversy escalated, social activist and Ballari-based Anna Foundation chief Rajshekar Mulali wrote to the Prime Minister’s Office and the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), seeking legal action against Rao for alleged misuse of power, public office and police uniform, and for showing “disrespect to national and state symbols”.Another activist, Dinesh Kallahalli, filed a complaint with the chief secretary and additional chief secretary, demanding Rao’s suspension and disciplinary action under the All India Services (Discipline & Appeal) Rules, 1969.Late Monday evening, two audio clips also surfaced on social media, purportedly featuring a conversation between a police officer and a woman. Their authenticity could not be independently verified. The circulation of the audio, alongside the videos, further fuelled political and public outrage.Senior BJP MLA and former law minister S Suresh Kumar termed the alleged acts “an unforgivable crime” that cast a shadow over the credibility of the police force, pointing to the tricolour visible in the background of the video as a sign of disrespect to the national flag. Opposition leaders accused the government of shielding the officer and demanded an independent probe.Women and Child Development Minister Laxmi Hebbalkar said the government would act “mercilessly, irrespective of seniority” if wrongdoing was established.Rao, who is also the stepfather of Kannada actor Harshavardhini Ranya alias Ranya Rao has faced scrutiny earlier in his career. Opposition leaders cited previous controversies to argue for swift and strict action.The state government said the authenticity of the videos and audio clips will be verified and that further action will depend on the outcome of the inquiry.","Karnataka DGP (Civil Rights Enforcement) K Ramachandra Rao was suspended on Monday night.

From party worker to its president: Nitin Nabin becomes BJP's youngest chief — 10 things to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-party-worker-to-president-nitin-nabin-takes-charge-as-youngest-bjp-chief-10-things-to-know/articleshow/126757934.cms,"Nitin Nabin takes charge as BJP chief

Who is Nitin Nabin?

Nitin Nabin is a Bihar cabinet minister who has been elected unopposed to the BJP’s national president post.

He is 45 years old and is the youngest national president of the BJP, surpassing Nitin Gadkari’s record.

Nabin is a five-term MLA from Bankipur in Patna, one of the BJP’s strongest urban constituencies in Bihar.

The new BJP chief currently serves as Public Works Department (PWD) minister in the Bihar government.

His rise in the BJP is closely associated with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership style and organisational inputs from Amit Shah.

He comes from a strong political lineage and is the son of veteran BJP leader Nabin Kishore Sinha , who died in 2006, after which Nabin entered electoral politics.

, who died in 2006, after which Nabin entered electoral politics. Nabin began his political journey through the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and later rose through the BJP’s youth wing.

He has held key organisational roles, including national general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and BJYM Bihar president (2016–19).

Nabin played a crucial organisational role in BJP’s Chhattisgarh turnaround, accurately predicting the party’s 2023 assembly victory and later overseeing its strong 2024 Lok Sabha performance.

Belonging to the Kayastha community, a numerically small group in Bihar, his elevation underlines the BJP leadership’s preference for organisational ability over caste arithmetic.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Nitin Nabin on Tuesday assumed charge as the party's new national president, marking a key transition in the ruling party's organisational leadership.The swearing-in ceremony was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with several senior party leaders. BJP chief ministers, national office-bearers, state unit presidents and members of the party’s national executive were also present at the event held in the national capital.The ruling party on Monday declared Nabin as its sole candidate for the post after the nomination and scrutiny process concluded without any rival contenders. This cleared the path for his unopposed election as the party’s 12th national president.In a late-night statement, BJP National Returning Officer K. Laxman said that only Nabin’s name remained after the completion of nominations and the withdrawal window, confirming his election by consensus.After assuming the position, Nitin Nabin said the moment is ""a moment of resolve"" for him and expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Prime Minister.""Today, I am not just assuming a position. I am accepting the ideology, traditions, and the responsibility of a nationalist movement of this party, and on this occasion, I also pay my respects to all my senior colleagues...Today, 140 crore Indians are connecting themselves with the dream of a developed India and are working to take the country forward,"" Nitin Nabin said in his first address after taking charge as the BJP chief.“When it is about the party, Nitin Nabin is my boss,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, calling himself a “party worker” of the BJP.Addressing the gathering after the inauguration of Nitin Nabin as the BJP's youngest-ever national president, PM Modi said: “When it is about the party, Nitin Nabin is my boss.”The Prime Minister also highlighted new party chief's age, saying, “…Nitin Nabin ji will carry forward the legacy of the BJP. To put it in the language of today’s youth, Nitin ji himself is, in a way, a millennial.”Elaborating further, PM Modi said, “The next 25 years are very important. This is the period when a developed India is to be built, and it is destined to happen. At the beginning of this crucial period, our Nitin Nabin ji will carry forward the legacy of the BJP.Ahead of the formal assumption of office, the BJP headquarters in New Delhi wore a festive look on Tuesday morning. Nabin began the day by offering prayers at the Jhandewalan Temple and later visited the Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place.Reacting to his elevation, BJP MP Manan Kumar Mishra said the party’s decision reflected its intent to promote younger leadership while relying on experience.“The party has taken a resolve to give space to young leadership. He is young and also quite social. He has a lot of experience. Our party is the largest party in the world. Under his leadership, even better work will be done,” Mishra told reporters.Nabin has been serving as the party’s working national president prior to this elevation.","Nitin Nabin is a Bihar cabinet minister who has been elected unopposed to the BJP’s national president post.

"Fed independence test: US Supreme Court signals support for Lisa Cook, questions Donald Trump’s bid to remove her",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/fed-independence-test-us-supreme-court-signals-support-for-lisa-cook-questions-donald-trumps-bid-to-remove-her/articleshow/127027975.cms,"The US Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared inclined to allow Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to continue in office, signalling scepticism over President Donald Trump ’s attempt to fire her — a move that could have far-reaching implications for the independence of the central bank, AP reported.During nearly two hours of arguments, a majority of the nine-judge bench questioned the basis and timing of Trump’s effort to remove Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, over allegations of mortgage fraud that she has strongly denied. No US president has fired a sitting Fed governor in the institution’s 112-year history.Allowing Cook’s removal to proceed “would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh said, echoing concerns raised by several other justices. At least five members of the court appeared doubtful that Trump’s action should be allowed to take effect while Cook’s legal challenge is still pending.Both Cook and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were present in the packed courtroom as the justices considered whether Cook should remain in her post while lower courts continue to review the case. Judges in those courts have so far allowed her to stay on the Fed’s seven-member board.The case is being closely watched by Wall Street and policy circles, as Trump’s critics argue that the underlying motivation is his desire to exert greater control over US interest-rate policy. If Cook were removed, Trump could appoint a replacement and potentially secure a majority on the Fed board.Trump has repeatedly criticised the Fed for not cutting rates aggressively enough, arguing that sharply lower rates would reduce government borrowing costs and ease pressure on households buying homes, cars and other big-ticket items. Speaking earlier on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he again called for the US to have “the lowest interest rates in the world”.The Fed cut rates three times in the last four months of 2025 but has signalled caution going forward because of inflation concerns.The immediate issue before the court is procedural: whether Cook can remain in office while the dispute plays out. The justices could deny Trump’s emergency appeal, leaving her in place for now. Chief Justice John Roberts suggested it may be ineffective to simply send the matter back to lower courts without offering clearer guidance.The confrontation has escalated sharply. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Powell and issued subpoenas to the Fed — actions Powell has publicly described as “pretexts” masking frustration over monetary policy.Trump’s legal team argues that Cook’s alleged mortgage filings — claiming two properties as primary residences in 2021 — amount to “gross negligence at best” and justify her dismissal. Cook, who has not been charged with any crime, denies wrongdoing, saying the case rests on a single, innocuous reference contradicted by other accurate disclosures.While the Supreme Court has previously allowed Trump broad latitude to dismiss heads of other agencies, the justices signalled that the Fed’s unique, quasi-independent status may warrant a different approach.",US Supreme Court appears inclined to allow Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to continue in office.

The benchmark moved closer to the record high it had touched earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced about 200 points, or 0.4 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.1 per cent in early trade, AP reported.Markets found some support after Trump, speaking before business and government leaders in Europe, said he would not use force to take “the piece of ice”, a reference to Greenland. Trump later acknowledged that his comments on Greenland had contributed to Tuesday’s market fall, but dismissed the drop as “peanuts compared to what it’s gone up” during the first year of his second term.In the bond market, US Treasury yields steadied, a day after jumping amid concerns over longer-term inflation. The 10-year Treasury yield eased to 4.28 per cent from 4.30 per cent, though it remained above levels seen before Trump announced plans to impose 10 per cent tariffs on several European countries starting February, in addition to a proposed 15 per cent tariff under a yet-to-be-ratified EU trade agreement.Despite calmer equity trading, some signs of risk aversion persisted.

"EU–Mercosur trade pact: Parliament sends deal to EU court, farmers celebrate while exporters flag risks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eumercosur-trade-pact-parliament-sends-deal-to-eu-court-farmers-celebrate-while-exporters-flag-risks/articleshow/127003108.cms,"Explained: Why India-EU 'Mother Of All Deals' Matters As Trade Talks Enter Final High Stakes Phase

The European Parliament has voted to refer the recently signed EU-Mercosur free trade agreement to the bloc’s top court, pushing the long-negotiated pact into legal uncertainty just days after it was sealed, according to an AFP report.Lawmakers in Strasbourg voted 334 to 324 in favour of asking the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to examine whether the agreement complies with EU rules. The move follows the signing of the deal on Saturday with Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, aimed at creating one of the world’s largest free trade areas.The decision was greeted with celebration by farming groups, particularly from France, which has led opposition to the pact over concerns about agricultural imports. Hundreds of farmers gathered with tractors outside the European Parliament ahead of the vote and cheered as the result was announced.“We’ve been on this for months and months, for years,” Quentin Le Guillous, head of a French young farmers’ group, told AFP. “Tonight, I’m going home, I’m going to kiss everyone, and I’m going to tell my kids, ‘I got it, we got it, we can be proud.’”The court referral deals a setback to the European Commission, which negotiated and champions the agreement.Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had earlier described the pact as a “historic deal,” especially at a time when countries are seeking new trade partners amid tariff threats from the US administration.The Commission said it “regrets” the parliament’s decision. Trade spokesman Olof Gill said the questions raised by lawmakers were “not justified,” arguing that the Commission had already addressed concerns in detail.At the heart of the legal challenge is whether the agreement can be partially applied before full ratification by all EU member states, and whether it improperly limits EU powers on environmental and food-safety standards.The decision also drew criticism from industry. Hildegard Mueller, head of Germany’s auto industry group VDA, said the vote sent a “devastating sign” and risked alienating Mercosur partners at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty.Germany, Spain and Nordic countries back the deal, viewing it as a way to boost exports amid competition from China. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said after the vote: “We are convinced of the legality of the agreement. No more delays. The agreement must now be provisionally applied.”However, France, Poland, Austria, Ireland and Hungary remain opposed, citing risks to domestic agriculture. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said, “The fight continues to protect our agriculture and guarantee our food sovereignty.”The EU-Mercosur deal would ease tariffs on more than 90 per cent of bilateral trade, favouring European exports such as cars, wine and cheese, while opening EU markets further to South American beef, poultry, sugar and soy.Together, the EU and Mercosur account for around 30 per cent of global GDP and more than 700 million consumers.","The European Parliament has voted to refer the recently signed EU-Mercosur free trade agreement to the bloc's top court.

Greenland 'WAR': Macron DARES Trump With NATO Military Drills As US Hints At Sending Troops

Trump: US is economic engine on the planet

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday addressed the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos in Switzerland, pitching the American growth story and calling it a miracle. Praising his administration, Trump spoke of how he believes the US has gone from being a ‘dead economy’ to the ‘hottest’ in the world in a year.“Today, after 12 months back in the White House, our economy is booming. Growth is exploding, productivity is surging, investment is soaring, incomes are rising. Inflation has been defeated…United States is in the midst of the fastest and most dramatic economic turnaround in our country's history,” Trump said.Criticizing his predecessor Joe Biden, Trump said, “Under the Biden administration, America was plagued by the nightmare of stagflation, meaning low growth and high inflation, a recipe for misery, failure and decline. But now, after just one year of my policies, we're witnessing the exact opposite, virtually no inflation, and extraordinarily high economic growth.”Talking about Wall Street, Trump said that the stock market has hit new record highs 52 times since the election.“We were a dead country. Now we are the hottest country anywhere in the world. In fact, the United States economy is on pace to grow at double the rate that was projected by the IMF just last April, and with my growth and tariff policies, it should be much higher.I believe we can be much higher than that,” Trump said.Calling US the ‘economic engine on the planet’, Trump said, “...when America booms, the entire world booms. It's been history.""He further remarked that parts of Europe have changed so dramatically that, in his view, they are no longer familiar. “Certain places in Europe are not recognizable frankly anymore. They’re not recognizable,” he said.Expressing concern about Europe’s trajectory, Trump added, “I want to see Europe go good, but it’s not heading in the right direction.” He attributed Europe’s difficulties to an emphasis on green energy policies and large-scale migration.",US President Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos in Switzerland.

Nikkei also traded in red, down 280 points or 0.53% to 52,710. South Korea's Kospi was down 2 points or 0.04%.Meanwhile, Shanghai and Shenzhen added 0.16% and 0.76% to reach 4,120 and 14,263, respectively.Bond markets remained firmly in focus, particularly in Japan, where finance minister Satsuki Katayama sought to soothe nerves after a heavy sell-off pushed yields to record highs. In Asian trading, US Treasuries stabilised after long-term yields had jumped during the previous US session. The 30-year Treasury yield rose eight basis points to a four-month high, driven by a rout in Japanese bonds and reports that a Danish pension fund was preparing to exit US government debt. The dollar edged slightly lower, according to a Bloomberg index.Market movements reflected growing unease among global investors over the direction of US foreign policy, with funds scaling back exposure to American assets.Volatility has been fuelled by President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on European countries that opposed his proposal for the US to purchase Greenland, prompting investors to reassess the US as a reliable safe haven, Reuters reported.The sell-off that swept global markets on Tuesday originated in Japan, where yields on 30-year government bonds surged by more than a quarter of a percentage point. The jump followed concerns surrounding Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s plans to reduce taxes while increasing public spending. The rise in yields threatened to unwind carry trades that rely on Japan’s low borrowing costs, contributing to higher yields in other markets.In response, Japan’s finance minister urged market participants to remain calm, highlighting the country’s lowest dependence on debt issuance in 30 years, rising tax revenues and the smallest fiscal deficit among Group-of-Seven economies as signs that fiscal policy remains responsible and sustainable.Elsewhere, Danish pension fund AkademikerPension said it would divest from US Treasuries by the end of the month, citing concerns over credit risks linked to the Trump administration. “The US is basically not a good credit and long-term the US government finances are not sustainable,” Anders Schelde, chief investment officer at AkademikerPension, told Bloomberg on Tuesday.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent also called for restraint, comparing the reaction to the Greenland issue to what he described as the “hysteria” that followed Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs in April. Trump is expected to arrive in Davos on Wednesday for the World Economic Forum.Adding to the cautious mood, South Korea is set to delay plans to invest up to $20 billion in the US this year due to pressure on its currency, according to a person familiar with the matter.","Stocks market in Asia traded mostly red on Wednesday ahead of US President Donald Trump's speech in Davos.

Short-term jitters or a longer mood swing?

Wall street took a sharp hit on Tuesday, plunging to their steepest single-day losses in three months, as investors reacted to US President Donald Trump's fresh tariff threats targeting Europe. The move sparked a widespread risk-off selloff across asset classes, triggering concerns about another round of market volatility.All three major US indices posted their worst daily performance since October 10, last year. While the S&P 500 dropped 143.15 points, or 2.06%, to close at 6,796.86, Nasdaq Composite tumbled 561.07 points, or 2.39%, to 22,954.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 870.74 points, or 1.76%, settling at 48,488.59.Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the session below their 50-day moving averages, Reuters reported.The impact was not limited to just equities. In other asset classes, gold climbed to fresh record highs as investors rushed towards safer assets, while US Treasuries came under renewed selling pressure, pushing borrowing costs higher. Bitcoin, which usually benefits during periods of market stress, declined more than 3%.Tuesday marked the first chance for US investors to react to Trump’s weekend remarks, as markets were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King, Jr Day. Trump said that additional 10% import tariffs would be imposed from February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Great Britain, all countries already facing US tariffs. He further added that the levies would rise to 25% from June 1 and remain in place until the US reached a deal to purchase Greenland.Meanwhile, leaders in Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, and Denmark have maintained that the island is not for sale.The return of tariff-related uncertainty was similar to market disruptions seen earlier in April, during what was referred to as “Liberation Day”, when Trump’s trade measures against global partners pushed the S&P 500 close to bear market territory.The CBOE Volatility Index, a measure that indicates market fear, jumped to 20.09 points, its highest closing level since November 24. Trading activity also accelerated, with almost 20.6 billion shares changing hands on US exchanges, well above the 20-day average of 17.01 billion.In India, the NSE and BSE benchmarks also ended the day in red, falling over 1% each, erroding investors of almost Rs 9.86 lakh crore. While Nifty50 slid 1.38% to close at 25,232.5, Sensex fell 1,065.71 points, or 1.28%, to settle at 82,180.47.Elsewhere, on Wednesday, Asian stocks also showed losses for a third session, amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.While investor sentiment was clearly strained, questions remain over whether the sharp reaction is a short-lived response or signals deeper market implications.Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, said he was not seeing evidence of investors exiting the market. ""I'm not at the point yet where I'm willing to say what is happening with Greenland, and the resurgence of the tariff threat back and forth, is going to precipitate a correction in the equities markets,"" he told Reuters. The expert further added that he would be surprised if markets fell by 3% to 5% this week.Cox pointed instead to developments in bond markets as a potentially more significant risk. Japanese government bonds fell sharply on Tuesday, sending yields to record highs, while Tokyo stocks and the yen weakened after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi called for a snap election, raising concerns over Japan’s fiscal health. The moves contributed to higher yields on longer-dated European government bonds, while selling pressure in US Treasuries was more pronounced at the long end of the curve.Despite the renewed tariff threats and volatility across bond markets, the US economy continues to show strength. Investors are set to receive a series of economic indicators this week, including an update to third-quarter GDP, January PMI data and the Personal Consumption Expenditures report, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure.The earnings season is also gathering momentum, with several major companies due to report results. Netflix was among those in focus, ending the session 0.8% lower ahead of its quarterly earnings announcement after market close.","All three major US indices posted their worst daily performance since October 10, last year.

Netflix capped last year with another solid financial performance despite slowing subscriber growth that underscored the importance of its contested $72 billion bid to take over Warner Bros. ' movie studio and slot HBO Max into its video streaming line-up.The fourth-quarter results announced Tuesday eclipsed the projections of stock market analysts, but Netflix's report also noted that the video service ended the year with more than 325 million worldwide subscribers, a figure indicating it has added about 23 million subscribers since 2024.The 2025 subscriber increase marked a dramatic slowdown from the 41 million picked up during 2024, amplifying investor worries that Netflix's growth has peaked since the 2022 introduction of a low-priced, advertising-supported version of its service that triggered a massive surge in subscribers.Management also forecast a profit for the January-March period that was below analysts' predictions and announced Netflix would stop buying back its own stock while trying to complete the Warner Bros' deal. Even though its ad sales are expected to double, Netflix also projected its revenue growth would taper off from 16% in 2025 to 12% to 14% this year.""Overall, this points to a challenging start to the year,"" said Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro.Netflix's shares sank nearly 5% in extended trading, even though its profit and revenue for the past quarter were better than anticipated. The company earned $2.4 billion, or 56 cents per share, 29% increase from the same time in the previous year. Revenue rose 18% from the previous year to more than $12 billion.The results almost seemed like a footnote next to the stakes involved in Netflix's bidding war to buy Warner Bros. Discovery .The battle took another turn earlier Tuesday when Netflix converted its original offer that included a stock component into an all-cash deal in hopes of simplifying the process and making it easier for Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders to resist Paramount's overtures.Although Warner Bros. has reiterated its commitment to getting the Netflix deal done, Paramount isn't showing any signs of backing down and could still sweeten its counteroffer to turn up the heat another notch.Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos seemed to send a warning shot across Paramount's bow during a Tuesday conference call as he recalled fending off rivals such as Walmart and the now-vanquished Blockbuster video chain during the company's days as a DVD-by-mail rental service. ""We are no strangers to competition and we are now strangers to change,"" Sarandos said.Besides having to fend off Paramount, Netflix will also need to persuade U.S. regulators that adding HBO to a streaming service that has the most subscribers in the country won't stifle competition and drive up prices that have already been rising in recent years.The uncertainty has been reflected in Netflix's stock price, which has fallen by20% since its agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery was unveiled last month. It's a cloud likely to hang over Netflix through most of this year because the company doesn't expect to complete its purchase until Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its cable TV business - a process expected to take six to nine months.""We are energized as ever to achieve our mission to entertain the world,"" Sarandos said.","Netflix ended the year with more than 325 million worldwide subscribers, a figure indicating it has added about 23 million subscribers since 2024.

Trump's Greenland Threat Backfires? EU Boss VDL Warns 'Tariffs A Mistake', Signals De-dollarisation

The European Parliament is planning to suspend approval of the EU-US trade deal agreed last July in response to President Donald Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs on European nations over Greenland.The decision is expected to be formally announced in Strasbourg on Wednesday, signaling heightened tensions between Washington and its European allies, according to the BBC.The July 2025 trade deal, struck at Trump’s golf course in Scotland, reduced US tariffs on European goods to 15% from the 30% initially threatened in April, in exchange for European investments in the US and measures to boost American exports.The voting was initially scheduled for January 26-27, where lawmakers were expected to remove tariffs on US industrial goods under the deal. However, influential European Parliament members, including Manfred Weber of the European People’s Party, said approval is not possible at this stage following Trump’s weekend tariff threats.Trump has warned of 10 per cent tariff from February 1 on goods from Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, the UK, and Norway until the US is allowed to acquire Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark.European officials condemned the US move as coercive. French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that the threat of customs duties “is being used as blackmail to obtain unjustifiable concessions”.He added that the European Commission has “very powerful instruments” to respond. In a post on social media, he emphasized that France remains committed to security cooperation with the US but is prepared to reject unacceptable proposals, according to Reuters.The tariff threat has revived fears of a trade war, rattling global markets. European stock indices fell for a second consecutive day on Tuesday, while the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were down more than 1% in early US trading. On currency markets, the euro climbed 0.8% to $1.1742 and the pound rose 0.2% to $1.346, while the US dollar slipped sharply.The EU had previously held off retaliatory measures against US tariffs worth €93 billion ($109 billion), scheduled to resume on February 7 unless an agreement or extension is reached.Denmark, backed by the EU, has stressed diplomatic channels remain open despite the strong stance.Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said, “The US is also more than the president. Checks and balances exist in American society.”Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni have voiced readiness to defend Greenland, with Meloni describing Trump’s threat as a “mistake.”","The European Parliament is planning to suspend approval of the EU-US trade deal agreed last July in response to President Donald Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs on European nations.

Trump's Greenland Threat Backfires? EU Boss VDL Warns 'Tariffs A Mistake', Signals De-dollarisation

US stocks dropped sharply in morning trading on Tuesday after President Donald Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on eight NATO members. The move has escalated geopolitical tensions over his push to assert American control over Greenland.The sell-off marked the first opportunity for markets to react to the latest escalation, after U.S. exchanges were closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday.At around 10.04 am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 682 points, or 1.5%. The S&P 500 fell 1.5%, retreating further from the record high it had touched early last week, while the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.7%, weighed down by losses in heavyweight technology stocks, news agency AP reported.Losses were broad-based across sectors. Technology stocks led the decline, reflecting their outsized influence on market movements. Nvidia dropped 3.2%, Amazon fell 2.7%, JPMorgan Chase declined 1.9%, and Caterpillar lost 1.3%.Retailers, banks and industrial companies also traded sharply lower. The energy sector was a rare gainer, supported by higher crude prices, with Exxon Mobil rising 1.5%.The market downturn followed Trump’s announcement over the weekend that the United States would impose a 10% import tax from February on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland.The annual combined imports from European Union nations exceed those from the US’s two largest individual import sources, Mexico and China, underscoring the potential economic impact of a prolonged trade standoff.Trump linked the tariff threat to opposition from European countries to his desire to bring Greenland, a self-governing territory of NATO member Denmark under US control.He also tied his aggressive stance to Norway’s decision last year not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize, saying in a text message to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre that he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace.”His remarks appeared to intensify a standoff between Washington and its closest allies, triggering outrage and a flurry of diplomatic activity across Europe. European leaders are weighing possible countermeasures, including retaliatory tariffs and the first-ever use of the European Union’s anti-coercion instrument.European markets fell sharply for a second straight session, while Asian markets also ended lower. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.1%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 0.3%, South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.4%, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.7%, Taiwan’s Taiex gained 0.4%, and India’s Sensex declined 0.8%.Investors sought safety amid rising uncertainty, pushing precious metals to fresh highs. Gold surged 3.2% to a record level, while silver soared 7%, with both assets benefiting from heightened demand for safe havens during geopolitical turmoil.In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose to 4.28% from 4.23% late Friday, while the two-year yield edged down to 3.59% from 3.60%. Oil prices also moved higher, with U.S. benchmark crude rising 1.5%.Market participants said geopolitical risks would remain a dominant theme in the near term, with investors closely watching developments around trade, diplomacy and policy signals as the standoff between the US and Europe unfolds.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 682 points, or 1.5%.

Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS

Netflix has revised its proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, shifting to an all-cash transaction valued at USD 27.75 per share. The move aims at simplifying the deal structure and strengthening its position amid rival takeover efforts.The revised offer values Warner Bros. Discovery at an enterprise value of about USD 82.7 billion, including debt and replaces Netflix’s earlier cash-and-stock proposal.Netflix and Warner Bros. said on Tuesday that the amended structure is intended to provide greater certainty of value to shareholders and accelerate the path to a shareholder vote, according to Reuters.Under the revised agreement, Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders will receive USD 27.75 per share in cash. In addition, they will retain exposure to Discovery Global, a planned spin-off that will house television assets such as CNN, TNT Sports and the Discovery+ streaming service. Both companies said their boards have unanimously approved the amended all-cash deal.Netflix has been locked in a takeover tussle with Paramount Skydance, which has pursued a rival bid for Warner Bros. and last week escalated its efforts by announcing plans to nominate its own slate of directors ahead of the next shareholder meeting.Paramount has argued that its offer is superior, but Warner Bros. has repeatedly rejected that claim.Explaining the rationale behind the revised offer, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that the new structure would help move the deal forward faster.“Our revised all-cash agreement will enable an expedited timeline to a stockholder vote and provide greater financial certainty,” Sarandos said in a statement.Netflix’s move comes without increasing the overall valuation of the deal, in what analysts see as an attempt to shut the door on Paramount’s competing bid.The earlier offer comprised USD 23.25 in cash and USD 4.50 in Netflix stock, a structure that came under pressure after Netflix shares fell nearly 15 per cent since the merger announcement in early December.In a regulatory filing, Warner Bros. said that the revised terms offer shareholders immediate liquidity and reduced risk.“The merger consideration is a fixed cash amount to be paid by an investment-grade company, providing stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity immediately upon closing,” the company said.Warner Bros. also disclosed details of its valuation for Discovery Global, which shareholders will own separately following the split. Advisers estimated a wide valuation range for the spinoff, from as low as USD 1.33 per share to as high as USD 6.86 per share, depending on future deal activity. Paramount has dismissed the spinoff’s value, calling it effectively worthless.Market reaction was mixed. Netflix shares rose about 1.2–1.3 per cent before the opening bell, while Warner Bros Discovery shares were little changed. Paramount shares slipped around 1 per cent.The competing bids are expected to come to a head later this year when Warner Bros. shareholders vote on the proposed transaction.Paramount Skydance’s tender offer, which expires on January 21, has so far failed to win board support. A Delaware court recently rejected Paramount’s attempt to force faster disclosures related to Warner Bros.’ cable TV assets.Analysts say that the shareholder approval may only be the first hurdle, as lawmakers across the political spectrum have raised concerns that further consolidation in the media industry could reduce competition and consumer choice.Nonetheless, Netflix has argued that its larger scale, investment-grade credit rating and lower leverage profile make its offer more attractive than Paramount’s.With control of Warner Bros.’ prized studios, streaming assets and franchises such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and DC Comics at stake, the battle for the Hollywood giant is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched media deals of the year.","Netflix has revised its proposed acquisition of Warner Bros.

Xi 'SCOLDS' Trump For Using China To Stoke Greenland Fear | US' Arctic Power Play Backfires?

China on Tuesday said there were no winners in trade and tariff wars and called for more cooperation and dialogue in the global economy.Speaking at the World Economic Forum annual meeting, China’s vice-premier He Lifeng said countries should work together instead of turning inward. He added that while economic globalisation had flaws, nations could completely reject it or move towards self-isolation.Lifeng further said that China would “open its door wider to the world” and the country planned to expand its market, with a focus on the services sector.He also spoke about China’s economic progress and said domestic demand had been placed at the centre of the country’s economic agenda for 2026. The aim, he said, is to boost consumption while maintaining China’s production strength.The remarks come at a time of rising global trade tensions following the trade war launched by US President Donald Trump during his second term.China earlier said its economy grew by 5 per cent last year, meeting its official target. Growth was supported by a record trade surplus, even though the economy slowed to 4.5 per cent in the final three months of 2025.Over the past year, China has faced challenges in boosting domestic spending, a prolonged property crisis, and disruption linked to US tariff policies under President Trump.Trump, who began his second term on January 20, 2025, has expanded tariffs as part of efforts to protect US industries and reduce trade deficits.In the latest move, Trump has announced 10 per cent tariffs on imports from eight European countries Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland. The tariffs, set to take effect from February 1, 2026, were linked to his demand for the “complete and total purchase of Greenland”.Trump said the tariffs would remain until a deal was reached. His remarks followed reports that some European countries had sent troops to Greenland in support of Denmark.","China’s vice-premier He Lifeng said countries should work together instead of turning inward.

EU Puts India At Core Of Historic Trade Reset At Davos, Ursula Leyen Terms It 'Mother Of All Deals'

India is close to signing a trade deal with the European Union, as stated by EU chief Ursula von der Leyen during the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday.""There is still work to do. But we are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement. Some call it the mother of all deals. One that would create a market of 2 billion people, accounting for almost a quarter of global GDP,"" she said while outlining the EU’s push to expand and diversify its trade partnerships.She also linked the trade push to forthcoming high-level engagement, saying she will visit India next weekend following the World Economic Forum in Davos. She said the trip is aimed at advancing the proposed trade agreement and underscored that significant work remains to bolster economic ties and deepen cooperation between Europe and India. Von der Leyen is among the chief guests for the 77th Republic Day celebrations. During the India visit, the Eu chief, alongside president of the European Council Antonio Luis Santos da Costa , will also co-chair the 16th India-EU Summit on January 27.Talking about the proposed agreement with India within Europe’s broader global strategy, von der Leyen said the continent remains open to doing business with partners across the world and will continue to pursue active engagement.“Europe will always choose the world, and the world is ready to choose Europe,” she said, emphasising the EU’s determination to expand international trade and cooperation.Last week, Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal had also said the free trade agreement between India and EU, where negotiations are in the final phase, will be the ""mother of all deals"" signed by the country so far. ""I have done seven deals so far. All with developed economies. This one will be the mother of all,"" the union minister said.He added that, ""we are getting a super deal. In areas of EU interest also, we are giving them a super deal. It has to be a win-win. The good part is we do not compete with each other. We have different interests.""Before Goyal, commerce secretary Rajesh Agrawal said the two sides had completed negotiations on 20 of the 24 chapters, with efforts ongoing to conclude the talks by January 26.","EU Puts India At Core Of Historic Trade Reset At Davos, Ursula Leyen Terms It 'Mother Of All Deals' She will visit India next weekend following the World Economic Forum in Davos.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

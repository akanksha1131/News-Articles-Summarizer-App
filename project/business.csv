In that article, the Adani Group said it wasn’t “aware of any investigation against our chairman” and that it was fully compliant with anti-bribery laws in India and elsewhere.

While affluent India focuses on personalised plans, the middle requires expanded employer-sponsored insurance and emerging needs strengthened govt-funded schemes.The report highlights India's low healthcare spending and insufficient insurance coverage, and emphasises on the need for increased investment and comprehensive reforms. To enable and deliver this vision, it proposes leveraging the troika of the medical JAM - joined health data, automated claim settlements for 100% cashless transactions, and mobile-enabled on-demand healthcare access.India's healthcare spending, at 3.3% of GDP, severely lags global counterparts' - including both developed and emerging nations - according to the report. This underinvestment, coupled with insufficient insurance coverage, places substantial financial burden on citizens, particularly those in rural areas with limited access to quality healthcare.The report also pointed out that the healthcare system is skewed towards curative care, with a disproportionate 38% of spending allocated to in-patient services and treatments. In contrast, preventive care receives only 14% of the funds, highlighting a reactive rather than proactive approach to healthcare. This imbalance contributes to long-term inefficiencies and escalating healthcare costs.Adding to the strain, healthcare costs continue to surge, with claim sizes increasing by 11.4% and medical inflation reaching 14% in 2023.

In due course, we expect that to expand to capital investment and capital coming out of London and out of the UK to support PM Modi'ssustainable transport strategy. This is a two-year agreement initially, but we hope that it would blossom into a long-term partnership between London and the Indian govt because the growth in India is so spectacular and so fast that India needs friend and partners to support in delivering infrastructure ambitions,"" said Chris Hayward, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation. Hayward is the political leader of the entity.He added that a project pipeline is being readied, while insisting that it has to be a ""win-win deal"" for both sides.Hayward said that there is greater confidence in India now. ""One of the challenges of this bridge is that British and other firms have had their fingers burnt. The whole market in India has developed or changed since those days. But, of course, the first thing is confidence building in the British companies that they are not going to get their fingers burnt.""Asked if a bilateral investment treaty that is acceptable to the UK was a pre-requisite, he said: ""There are negotiations still in play. For this to succeed, the Indian govt has to make it as easy as possible for UK businesses to participate. If barriers are put up that are unacceptable, then it will not work. Regulatory certainty is important for everything, the world over.""","Government pitching roads, renewables and rapid transit projects for development under the India-UK investment bridge. City of London Corporation, officials from Niti Aayog and other ministries and companies from the UK and India discussed how projects could be identified.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115635357,imgsize-1871345,width-400,resizemode-4/115635357.jpg"

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001. The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.","Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

They’ve taken Q-commerce to villages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/theyve-taken-q-commerce-to-villages/articleshow/115632278.cms,"For nearly a year, this startup moved from a swanky 7,500 sqft office in Chennai and squeezed into a 2,500 sqft single-storey house in Trichy. The 50-member corporate team gave up chairs and tables and agreed to sit cross-legged on the floor with laptops so that all employees could be accommodated in one-third the space. The effort was to understand the semi-urban and rural markets where the company had launched operations.B2C supply chain platform Wheelocity, launched in April 2022, takes fresh vegetables and groceries in e-rickshaws to the doorsteps of customers in 3,500 towns and villages in the central districts of Tamil Nadu every day. So far, it has covered about one million customers. “While the urban centres and their suburbs are served well by retailers and q-commerce companies, such a network was absent in smaller towns and villages. That’s where we found our market,” says Selvam VMS, founder and CEO of Wheelocity. Trichy was selected as a launchpad. The team is bullish about replicating the model in the rest of Tamil Nadu and across the country.Wheelocity’s success can be traced to its founders’ experience at a B2B supplier to q-commerce companies all over India. Selvam was one of the co-founders of this Chennai-based company. Senthil Kumar A, who was in operations and logistics roles at leading companies including Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages in Bengaluru, joined the company to head its operations.The two of them got inspiration to start Wheelocity after a visit in 2021 to an agritec company that was operating in the fruits and vegetable supply chain space. “We were fascinated by the dimensions of the supply chain that carried fruits and vegetables,” says Senthil Kumar, cofounder and COO of Wheelocity. “It required new levels of expertise. And we had to go through the steep learning curve quickly,” he adds.Post-Covid, q-commerce companies were gaining momentum and Selvam and Senthil Kumar launched ‘Wheelocity’. “We contacted q-commerce firms and explained our expertise in the fruits and vegetables supply chain. A year later, we realised that this ecosystem has been built strongly in the cities, but not in tier-4 towns and rural hamlets, which were a bigger market. We decided to become a B2C company and wound up the B2B vertical,” says Selvam.The shift to Trichy in Aug 2023 followed. To their surprise, there was no attrition of staff when the shift was announced. A couple of months later, they started selling fruits, vegetables and groceries on e-rickshaw carts. About 1,500 e-vehicles traverse the lanes of towns and villages with a jingle that alerts households to their arrival.This June, the company again opened a swanky office at Olympia Cyberspace in Guindy while retaining the Trichy office. It is looking to expand operations across south India. The startup has announced the raising of $15 million for the purpose. It is looking to expand to about 20,000 villages over the next 12-14 months, targeting a user base of 10 million consumers.The core team still shuttles between Chennai and Trichy every other week. A portion of the workspace in Chennai also features seating on the floor for employees, whose number has more than doubled to 120. “We are looking at expanding our product category to all types of essentials and apparels,” says Selvam.","B2C supply chain platform Wheelocity, launched in April 2022, takes fresh vegetables and groceries in e-rickshaws to the doorsteps of customers in 3,500 towns and villages in the central districts of Tamil Nadu every day.

"‘For developed nation status by ’47, back fast-growing states’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/for-developed-nation-status-by-47-back-fast-growing-states/articleshow/115632346.cms,"The next 10 years are crucial for achieving economic goals of Tamil Nadu. If it fails to do so, the state risks of being trapped in the middle-income bracket, says finance minister Thangam Thennarasu. In an interview to TOI, he also explains how TN made its case to the 16th Finance Commission. Edited excerpts: TN stresses 16th finance commission recommendations are more crucial than ever.Why?Our estimates put the loss of revenue to the state from the 9th to 15th finance commissions at 3.57 lakh crore. Now, Tamil Nadu needs to become a high-income economy (region with higher per capita income) before the population ages, for that we need to spend on infrastructure. Additionally, as part of global supply chain diversification, the window of opportunity to attract more manufacturing activity is 2-3 years. Meanwhile, as the working-age population shrinks, there is an urgent need to invest in social safety nets, including insurance and pension contributions. We studied the experienwces of similarly placed countries such as Japan and Canada to learn from international experiences.In a debate on equity and efficiency in inter-state tax devolutions, it is important to support best-performing states such as Tamil Nadu at this juncture. The country cannot support all states equally, but facilitating key fast-growing states is crucial to achieve developed nation status by 2047. These states will, in turn, help less developed states as the divisible pool becomes bigger. Why does TN ask for a cap on imposition of cess?Despite 15th finance commission’s recommendations, effective devolution is only 33.16%. Additionally, cess and surcharges constitute 16.83% of the Union’s gross tax revenue. We have sought a 10% cap on cess and surcharges. If it is levied beyond that, then it should be brought to the divisible pool. Also, we want the Centre’s non-tax revenue, such as that from spectrum allocation, to be shared with states. What about Tamil Nadu’s suggestion on forest cover and natural disaster relief?Each state’s share should get based on its risks. We faced two major natural disasters (Chennai and southern districts’ floods), but no specific allocation was earmarked. The state govt provided immediate aid of 6,000 per family, built houses and provided long-term support.Current disaster risk index is not transparent. It should be replaced with a new index incorporating parameters such as coastline length and urbanisation. The funds should be allocated based on a widely accepted, universal risk index.Tamil Nadu’s recommendations also called for inclusion of mangrove forests, wetlands and to take the share of renewable power into account, not just the forest cover. We should have a composite index for climate mitigation efforts as a parameter in the tax-sharing formula. Why does Tamil Nadu bat for inclusion of urbanisation criteria and significant grants for building infrastructure?Tamil Nadu is rapidly urbanising. Peri-urban panchayats (adjacent to a metropolitan area) are where development happens, and the govt needs to support growth by laying roads, sewage systems, water supply and with better urban planning. With increasing urbanisation and migration, cities have to reinvent themselves. We need to invest in building infrastructure, upgrading power grids, building new railway lines, and metrorail in other cities to adequately support economic growth.The state’s present growth is made possible by the past investments -- both on physical infrastructure and on human capital. We need to develop infrastructure with public funds to accelerate that. Finance commission lauded TN’s presentation.Yes, it was a comprehensive, painstaking research. Our team worked for around three months after the Union budget. We explained what and why devolution should be, and got inputs from experts. The redistribution among states should be backed by scientific basis, backed by data. The issue is between growing and less developed states. Do you plan to raise voice with others, including BJP-ruled states?I spoke about the issue in Kerala sometime back. It’s open for all. These issues are relevant to all states, and there is no south-north divide. We will raise the issue along with states sharing similar views in all public forums, including Parliament.","Thangam Thennarasu: Tamil Nadu needs to become a high-income economy before the population ages.

"Burn some rubber, TN",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/burn-some-rubber-tn/articleshow/115632225.cms,"As an automotive hub, Tamil Nadu has deeply entrenched and well-developed tyre manufacturing capabilities. It is now tapping into that ecosystem to attract incremental investments from tyre companies that have long been present in TN.Two months ago, French tyre major Michelin announced it will set up a new plant in Tiruvallur. “We are investing 564 crore in this phase which will also generate up to 200 additional jobs,” says Shantanu Deshpande, MD, Michelin India.“This investment is over and above the existing investment of 2,840 crore in the country,” he adds. CEAT, which has invested a little more than 2,500 crore in the past five years, is planning to invest another 1,500 crore in a few years says Kumar Subbiah, CFO, CEAT.The state govt has been quick to see this as an investment and employment opportunity. It is working closely with these players to support both expansion and new investments, says industries minister T R B Rajaa. “Tamil Nadu has long been a hub for tyre manufacturing, with leading companies such as CEAT, Apollo Tyres, MRF Tyres, Yokohama, TVS Srichakra, Emerald Resilient Tyres, Michelin, and JK Tyres expanding operations in the state. Over the last few years, these companies have announced and initiated significant projects, many of which are now in various stages of implementation,” he adds.Most tyre companies are already long-term investors in TN and understand its advantages. “TN offers a compelling investment environment due to its integrated automotive ecosystem, superior infra and supportive govt policies,” says Anshuman Singhania, MD, JK Tyre & Industries. “For JK Tyre, proximity to natural rubber from Kerala, access to port infra, and availability of a skilled workforce in TN are integral to strategic growth plans,” he says. The company has invested about 3,000 crore in its Chennai plant.Those are pretty much the reasons why other tyre companies are also rooting for TN. Even those like Apollo Tyres, which now sources its raw material from across the globe especially for the high-performance tyres produced at the Chennai facility. “Proximity to a port minimises the logistics cost for import of raw material and export of finished goods,” says Gaurav Kumar, CFO, Apollo Tyres.Others like Michelin are rooting for making Tamil Nadu a green tyre hub. “The state govt has taken several measures to encourage decarbonisation and emissions reduction. Chennai is one of our most technologically advanced and green plants,” says Deshpande.The clean energy angle is something other tyre companies are also working for. CEAT would like to get more clean energy to make operations more sustainable, says Subbiah.“About 57% of Tamil Nadu’s installed energy capacity coming from renewable sources such as wind and solar. This commitment to sustainability enhances the state’s appeal to industries aiming to reduce their carbon footprint,” says Rajaa. Under the Tamil Nadu Industrial Policy 2021 (TNIP), companies get incentives to establish captive power plants.Tyre companies acknowledge the govt’s pro-active approach, but say a little more needs to be done. “We would like to see some state policies around incentivising the local manufacturers linked to investments, low-cost financing schemes and development of vocational training centres,” says JK’s Singhania. “Additionally, govt can help in acquiring land for large manufacturing facilities.”Others are looking for financial benefits. “Industry is looking at getting subsidy from the govt for new investments in R&D,” says Apollo Tyres’ Gaurav Kumar. The state can also facilitate schemes on the lines of National Employability Enhancement Mission and National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme, which will help TN youth get exposure to industry, he adds.Sector-specific incentives are key given the carrots being offered by other states. JK is expanding its Banmore (MP) and Laksar (Uttarakhand) plants. “Theseare strategically chosen to take advantage of various incentives offered by state govts,” says Singhania.Tamil Nadu Industrial Policy 2021 already offers a structured package of incentives including investment-linked benefits and support for expansion. So, the govt is prioritising workforce development.","As an automotive hub, Tamil Nadu has deeply entrenched and well-developed tyre manufacturing capabilities.

The bypolls held alongside the assembly elections witnessed key victories and surprising outcomes. From Priyanka Gandhi 's maiden triumph in Kerala's Wayanad to the BJP's dominance in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, the results offer fresh insights into the political landscape of states.Here’s a breakdown of the full winners list and key highlights from the crucial by-elections held recently.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi achieved her maiden electoral victory on Saturday by securing the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat in Kerala. With a commanding lead of over 4.1 lakh votes, Priyanka triumphed against CPI(M)-led LDF’s Sathyan Mokeri, as per the Election Commission’s figures.Priyanka garnered 6,22,338 votes, which was slightly less than the 6,47,445 votes won by her brother, Rahul Gandhi, in the April Lok Sabha elections. Despite the drop in voter turnout for the bypoll, Priyanka’s margin of victory—4,10,931 votes—was greater than Rahul’s 3,64,422-vote lead.In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP secured a decisive victory in the state’s by-elections. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath attributed the win to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asserting that the results signal the decline of the Samajwadi Party (SP)-INDIA bloc’s “politics of loot and lies.”The BJP emerged victorious in seven of the nine assembly seats that went to the polls, including Ghaziabad, Khair, and Phulpur, while the Samajwadi Party claimed victory in Sishamau and Karhal.The BJP claimed five out of seven seats in the Rajasthan Assembly by-elections. Key victories included Rajendra Bhamboo in Jhunjhunu, Rajendra Gurjar in Deoli-Uniara, and Shanta Amrit Lal Meena in Salumbar. Congress secured the Dausa seat, while the Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP) took the Chorasi seat. These results underscore BJP’s continuing strength in the state, despite local challenges.In Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) made significant gains in the by-elections, winning the Gidderbaha, Dera Baba Nanak, and Chabbewal Assembly seats. However, Congress successfully held on to the Barnala seat, a significant victory amid AAP's gains. The BJP, struggling in Punjab, failed to secure any seat, coming in a distant third in all four constituencies.In Gujarat, the BJP wrested the Vav assembly seat from Congress in a closely contested by-election. BJP’s Swarupji Thakor emerged victorious with a margin of 2,442 votes over Congress’s Gulabsinh Rajput. Thakor surged ahead in the final rounds of counting, highlighting BJP's continued dominance in the state.In Bihar, the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) claimed a sweeping victory in the state’s by-elections, securing four assembly seats. The NDA retained Imamganj and seized Tarari, Ramgarh, and Belaganj from the opposition INDIA bloc. A notable outcome was the poor showing of Jan Suraaj, a new party led by political strategist Prashant Kishor, which failed to secure even a single seat.In West Bengal, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) made a clean sweep in the state’s by-elections, retaining five seats and capturing the Madarihat seat from the BJP. The by-polls were held in six constituencies—Naihati, Haroa, Medinipur, Taldangra, Sitai (SC), and Madarihat (ST)—after MLAs vacated their seats following victories in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. This result further strengthens TMC’s political hold in West Bengal.","The bypolls held alongside the assembly elections witnessed key victories and surprising outcomes.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Ajit Pawar on Saturday clinched a decisive victory from his traditional Baramati assembly constituency, defeating his nephew Yugendra Pawar of the NCP ( Sharad Pawar ) faction by a margin of over 1 lakh votes.While Sharad Pawar was not directly in the fray, the contest was widely viewed as a battle for supremacy between the two factions of the NCP.This victory not only marked Ajit Pawar’s eighth consecutive term but also symbolized a significant shift in the political dynamics within the Pawar family, with Ajit delivering the first-ever defeat in this family bastion.Ajit, 65, who parted ways with his uncle Sharad Pawar last year, secured 1,81,132 votes compared to Yugendra’s 80,233 votes, defeating the 83-year-old veteran leader’s handpicked candidate by 1,00,899 votes.The Baramati assembly election was a high-stakes contest, coming just five months after Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP) triumphed in the Lok Sabha elections in the same constituency. Supriya Sule, Sharad Pawar's daughter, had then defeated Ajit Pawar's wife Sunetra by a margin of 1.5 lakh votes.Both factions left no stone unturned during the campaign. Sharad Pawar and his family, including his wife Pratibha and Sule’s daughter Revati, campaigned extensively for Yugendra. On the other hand, Ajit Pawar, emphasising his development record, brought his mother on stage during his concluding rally, cautioning voters against falling for an ""emotional pitch"" by the senior Pawar.Ajit Pawar’s win cements his claim as the political heir to his uncle, who founded the NCP in 1999. The split in 2023 saw Ajit aligning with the BJP-Shiv Sena government and securing the NCP name and symbol from the Election Commission, forcing Sharad Pawar's faction to rebrand itself as NCP (SP) with a new symbol, ""Man Blowing Turha.""Following his victory, Ajit Pawar expressed gratitude to voters and vowed to focus on development. “Our victory today makes our shoulders heavy with the huge responsibilities the people of Maharashtra have bestowed upon us for the next five years. We shall not spend a single moment speaking against anyone, only for the development of Maharashtra and the welfare of its people,” he said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).","Ajit Pawar, 65, secured 1,81,132 votes compared to Yugendra’s 80,233 votes.

A claim that Tesla founder Elon Musk once accused MacKenzie Scott , novelist, philanthropist, and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , of ""destroying Western civilization "" is currently resurfacing on social media. These rumors spread on various platforms, including Reddit, where one post claimed that Musk had criticized Scott for her philanthropy, which focuses on women, minorities, and marginalized groups.The claim, which cites a tweet from Musk, is true but requires context, according to a Snopes report.In March 2024, Musk posted a now-deleted tweet that read, ""Super rich ex-wives who hate their former spouse should be listed among 'Reasons that Western Civilization died.'"" Musk was responding to a post that criticized Scott’s philanthropic efforts, specifically noting that over half of her donations went to organizations focused on race and gender issues. The post asked, ""Who is Bezos' ex giving money to?""While Musk didn't directly name Scott, the context of his reply clearly pointed to the ex-wife of Bezos. The deleted tweet sparked significant backlash, and Musk later removed it. However, the tweet was preserved in the internet archive.This wasn't the first time Musk publicly criticized Scott’s charitable work. In May 2022, Musk expressed concerns about her donations, particularly to Democratic causes, according to a Snopes report. He suggested that Scott, in retaliation for her divorce from Bezos, was targeting all tech moguls, including him, by supporting political movements he believed opposed his business ventures, like Tesla.Scott is a prominent philanthropist. At the time of her 2019 divorce from Jeff Bezos, after 25 years of marriage, Scott, 50, received a 4% stake in Amazon.

This indicates a declining workforce demand, despite overall economic strength.The monthly average of weekly claims decreased by 3,750 to 217,750, smoothing out weekly fluctuations.Jobless benefit applications serve as an indicator of US redundancies.Following weakening employment figures and declining consumer prices, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points in September, followed by a 0.25-point reduction this month.Fed officials anticipated four benchmark rate reductions next year, following three cuts this year, as projected in September. However, this outlook has rapidly evolved.Recent robust economic indicators and President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies have prompted a more conservative approach from the Fed, potentially resulting in fewer reductions and higher rates than previously anticipated.The central bank has shifted its priority from inflation control to employment support, aiming to achieve a delicate balance of reducing inflation without triggering economic decline.September's 0.5-point rate reduction marked the Fed's first cut in four years, following increases since 2022 that elevated the federal funds rate to 5.3%, a 20-year high.Despite October's slight increase, inflation has consistently declined over two years, approaching the Fed's 2% goal, leading Chair Powell to confirm its general containment.In late October, government reports showed a Fed-monitored inflation measure reached its lowest point in three-and-a-half years.Early 2024 saw jobless benefit applications averaging 213,000 weekly before rising in May. July figures reached 250,000, suggesting high interest rates were affecting US employment.The US economy generated only 12,000 jobs in October, though economists noted the impact of strikes and hurricanes on temporary unemployment.The Labour Department's August report revealed 818,000 fewer jobs were created from April 2023 through March than initially reported, indicating a gradual employment slowdown and influencing the Fed's rate reduction decisions.","US unemployment benefit applications dropped by 6,000 to a near seven-month low to 213,000 last week.

This is a critical step towards achieving the Paris Agreement goals.This is the first time countries have explicitly defined how their individual emissions reduction goals will align with the collective global stocktake call at COP28. Recent analysis shows that if all countries reduce emissions on a straight line to net zero GHG—and those who have not yet set all-GHG net zero targets do so—global temperature rise would be limited to an average of 1.4C by the end of the century. This is a dramatic improvement from the average 2.7C temperature rise that the world is currently on track for.The United Kingdom, Brazil, and the United Arab Emirates have announced 2035 NDC targets that set a high bar for ambition. Bhutan, Madagascar, Panama, and Suriname have already achieved net zero greenhouse gas emissions.Canada, Chile, the European Union, Georgia, Mexico, Norway, and Switzerland aim to submit next NDCs that are consistent with the IPCC emissions trajectories and the global stocktake call for deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with 1.5°C.

India is BA’s second-largest market

Network expansion and partnerships

Strong India–UK travel corridor

British Airways is preparing to expand its India operations to tap into the country’s fast-growing aviation market and rising outbound travel demand, a senior airline executive said, citing the country's ""incredible potential"".The carrier, which has been flying to India for more than a century, currently operates 56 weekly flights from Indian cities to London — three daily services from Mumbai, two from Delhi, and one each from Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai.Subject to regulatory approvals, British Airways plans to add a third daily Delhi–London flight next year.“We are always looking to continue to expand our services as demand grows stronger. We continue to keep our network schedule under constant review to ensure we provide connectivity and choice for our customers,” British Airways Chief Operating Officer Rene de Groot told PTI.“As demand strengthens, we remain focused on expanding our services and elevating the travel experience,” he added.India is now British Airways’ second-biggest market after the US, with the airline maintaining crew bases in all five Indian cities it serves.De Groot said local hiring remains central to the airline’s service proposition.“In India, we continue to create employment opportunities, and support regional economies — all while promoting the best of Britain,” he said.British Airways also runs CallBA, its India contact centre located in Gurugram, which employs around 2,000 staff offering round-the-clock assistance to customers across the US, Europe and Asia-Pacific.“From a people perspective, we have invested heavily in India and steadily expanded our colleague presence here, with CallBA and our five Indian cabin crew bases growing in size,” De Groot noted.The airline maintains a codeshare partnership with IndiGo and, through its wider collaboration with Qatar Airways, serves 13 Indian destinations with a total of 148 weekly flights — including direct British Airways services from London and Qatar Airways connections via Doha.Earlier this year, the airline launched a Meet and Assist service for travellers needing extra support while flying from India to the UK.De Groot said the rapid expansion of Indian carriers is a positive sign for the market.“We view the dynamic growth of Indian carriers like IndiGo and Air India as a positive development for the aviation industry and for India’s emergence as a global aviation hub,” he also told PTI.“India is our second-largest market, and the rising demand, coupled with the expansion of carriers like IndiGo amongst others, reflects the incredible potential of this market.”The UK remains a preferred destination for Indian travellers — particularly for tourism and education — aided by the India–UK Free Trade Agreement. About 500,000 Indians visit the UK each year, and the Indian diaspora continues to be a strong driver of travel demand.",India is BA’s second-largest market after the US.

New labour codes: Indian companies face higher wage expenses; manpower costs may increase 5-15% across sectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-labour-codes-indian-companies-face-higher-wage-expenses-manpower-costs-may-increase-5-15-across-sectors/articleshow/125654580.cms,"An AI-generated image

Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

Companies review hiring and pay structures

Indian companies are likely to see higher wage bills as they adjust HR policies and compensation structures to comply with the new four labour codes. Experts estimate manpower costs could rise 5-10%, or even more for some firms.The increase in wage expenses is largely driven by higher costs for benefits such as gratuity, overtime, bonuses, and leave encashment, which will now be calculated according to the new wage definition, said Sonu Iyer, national leader, people advisory services – tax at EY India. Labour-intensive sectors like manufacturing, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and companies with fragmented pay structures are likely to experience the steepest increases.Firms where variable pay and allowances make up a significant part of total compensation may see only moderate rises, said Viswanath PS, chief executive at Randstad India. ""In such cases, a 5-10% increase in manpower cost is a reasonable estimate, though the exact impact will vary by industry and the current compensation design,"" he said, as quoted by ET.Companies are also reassessing hiring models, particularly the mix between contract and fixed-term employment, while realigning salary structures to comply with the uniform wage definition, experts noted.""As remuneration in kind (if any) up to 15% will be treated as wages, all employers will now need to re-examine what components of their current compensation structures will be treated as 'wages,' and which ones will be excluded from the definition,"" said Atul Gupta, partner – labour and employment practice at Trilegal. He added that gratuity is likely to see the most significant impact among employee benefits.""An increase in manpower costs on account of the recent labour codes may go up in the 5-12% range for a typical organised employer. And if the workforce was over indexed on allowances or contract labour, it may be 10-15%, or more,"" said Prabir Jha, founder and CEO of Prabir Jha People Advisory.Highlighting the employee perspective, Sudhakar Sethuraman, partner at Deloitte India, said, ""The codes specifically prohibit the employer from reducing the wages of the employees…So employees stand to gain from labour codes,"" as quoted by ET.The government, however, believes that the significant reduction in compliance burdens under the new codes will balance out any additional employer costs, including those arising from overtime payments or mandatory health checks for workers.","Indian companies are likely to see higher wage bills as they adjust HR policies and compensation structures to comply with the new four labour codes.

NEW DELHI: As the Winter Session of Parliament begins on Monday, the government is set to push a heavy economic agenda, lining up nine key bills ranging from insurance reforms to new taxation frameworks for sin goods such as tobacco and pan masala. The session will run from December 1 to 19 and will also take up the first batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2025-26.A major item on the list is the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which seeks to raise the foreign direct investment cap in insurance from 74 per cent to 100 per cent. The move, positioned as part of a wider effort to modernise financial-sector regulation, comes at a time when the industry has already drawn Rs 82,000 crore in FDI.On Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will also introduce two significant tax-related proposals in the Lok Sabha — The Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025 and The Health Security se National Security Cess Bill, 2025. Together, the bills aim to reshape how tobacco and pan masala are taxed. The measures would replace the GST compensation cess with an excise duty on tobacco products, while the new Health Security cess would be levied on machines or processes used to manufacture specified goods, with proceeds earmarked for national security and public health expenditure.Currently, tobacco and pan masala attract 28 per cent GST plus varying compensation cess rates.Another major reform on the agenda is the Securities Markets Code Bill, 2025, which proposes consolidating three separate laws governing India’s capital markets into a single unified code to streamline compliance and improve ease of doing business.The session is also expected to see progress on the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill, 2025, now with a Select Committee, which aims to decriminalise a wide range of minor offences and reduce regulatory friction for companies.Other economic bills planned for consideration include amendments related to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , Manipur GST, National Highways administration, and corporate law updates — rounding out what is expected to be one of the more reform-heavy sessions in recent years.","The Winter Session of Parliament begins on Monday.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in green on Monday on the back of strong domestic fundamentals and better-than-expected GDP growth numbers. While Nifty50 was above 26,250, BSE Sensex was near 86,000. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,284.65, up 82 points or 0.31%. BSE Sensex was at 85,984.27, up 278 points or 0.32%.Markets sustained their upward momentum for the third consecutive week, reaching lifetime highs, bolstered by enhanced global risk appetite and positive domestic indicators. With strengthening expectations of global rate cuts and India's growth prospects validated by robust GDP figures, market experts indicate a favourable medium-term market outlook.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “New record at the index level but no celebration in the market’ is the unique feature of the ongoing rally in the market. For most retail investors, their portfolio values are lower than those at the previous peak of September 2024. The reason for this paradox is the narrow nature of the rally. It is important to understand that eight stocks - HDFC Bank, RIL, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel, L&T, ITC, Infosys and SBI - have 50% weighting in Nifty.So when 5 or 6 of these heavy weights move up, assisted by a few other stocks, the index rises. This was what happened in this record breaking rally. Equally important is the fact that 330 stocks in NSE 500 are below their September 2024 peak. Most retail investors’ portfolios are dominated by stocks in this non-performing segment.”“The excellent Q2GDP numbers at 8.2%, particularly the impressive growth in manufacturing, services, and final consumption expenditure, have the potential to take the market higher. The modest nominal growth at 8.7% due to low GDP deflator is disappointing, from the market perspective. Another dampener from the market perspective is that a rate cut from the MPC may not materialise on Friday since the economy doesn’t need a monetary stimulus when it is firing on all cylinders. ”US stocks advanced during Friday's abbreviated post-Thanksgiving session, with low trading volumes, driven by strong retail performance and recovering technology stocks.Asian equities oscillated between positive and negative territory following modest US gains on Friday, as investors' attention shifts towards upcoming economic indicators ahead of an anticipated Federal Reserve rate reduction this month.Crude oil prices increased by over 1.5% on Monday following OPEC+ group's Sunday confirmation to maintain current production levels during Q1 next year.FPIs recorded net sales of Rs 3,795 crore on Friday, whilst domestic institutional investors showed net purchases of Rs 4,148 crore.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex opened in green on Monday on the back of strong domestic fundamentals and better-than-expected GDP growth numbers.

"Asian stocks today: Steady start on US rate-cut optimism; Nikkei falls 1.3%, Hang Seng up 1%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-stocks-today-steady-start-on-us-rate-cut-optimism-nikkei-falls-1-3-hang-seng-up-1/articleshow/125684243.cms,"AP image

Stock markets in Asia opened on a steady note on Monday as optimism over a possible US interest rate cut supported risk appetite at the start of the final month of 2025.Investors also kept a close watch on the Japanese yen, which strengthened amid expectations of a near-term policy shift in Tokyo.The yen advanced to 155.64 per US dollar as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda delivered a speech in Nagoya. Ueda said the central bank would weigh the “pros and cons” of raising interest rates at its next policy meeting in December, a comment that investors parsed for signals on the timing of a long-awaited hike.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was steady at 703.19, up 23.5% so far this year and on track for its strongest annual performance since 2017. Japan’s Nikkei, however, slipped 1.3% in early trading.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index climbed more than 1%, helping support broader Asian stocks, though US futures traded lower during Asian hours.“The risk bulls roll into December feeling positive about directional bias,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone. As earlier concerns faded, he said, investors were now driven by the fear of missing out and underperforming benchmarks.Markets will be guided this week by US economic releases on manufacturing, services and consumer sentiment. Analysts say volatility could rise as traders weigh whether the economy is cooling without slipping into recession.“With the US data void finally being filled and a busy economic calendar ahead, December looks set to be a merry one for volatility hunters,” said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at StoneX in Brisbane.He added that a controlled slowdown would likely keep sentiment upbeat while weakening the US dollar, which typically softens at year-end.The dollar index was little changed at 99.414, after falling 8% so far this year, most of the losses coming in early 2025.Investors will also track remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later on Monday, as dovish signals have increased confidence that a rate cut could come this month. Traders are now pricing an 87% probability of a cut.Holiday shopping trends remain another key indicator. US online spending on Black Friday hit a record $11.8 billion, up 9.1% from last year, according to Adobe Analytics.In commodities, oil prices rose after OPEC+ decided to keep output unchanged for the first quarter of 2026 amid worries about a potential supply glut. Brent crude futures gained 1% to $63.03 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude added 0.99% to $59.16.Meanwhile, Japan’s finance minister issued yet another warning against sharp foreign-exchange swings, saying recent yen moves were “clearly not driven by fundamentals.”Authorities have struggled to slow the currency’s slide as traders weigh doubts over the timing of the next rate hike and fiscal risks under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was steady at 703.19.

Nifty has finally shattered its 14-month barrier, setting a new all-time high and delivering its strongest-ever weekly and monthly close. This milestone gives bulls every reason to cheer. The rally wasn’t limited to the benchmark alone—Nifty Bank, Nifty Private Bank, Nifty Financial Services, Nifty Auto, and Nifty Infra also scaled record highs, reaffirming that leadership sectors remain firmly in control and continue to march ahead with confidence.Yet, beneath the headline optimism, the broader market tells a different story. While the Nifty Midcap 100 managed to notch a fresh peak, the move was driven by select stocks, signalling narrow participation. In contrast, the Nifty Smallcap 100 slipped for the second straight week and continues to trade below its 20, 50, and 100-day EMAs, reflecting caution and lack of momentum in the smallest segment of the market.The big question now: will the broader market join the rally? Based on current chart structures, meaningful participation from small caps appears unlikely in the near term. Expect the uptrend to remain selective, with sector rotation and stock-specific moves driving gains.Going ahead, Nifty is likely to maintain its upward bias and test 26500, followed by 26800 in the short term. On the downside, the 20-day EMA zone of 25950–25900 should act as a key support in case of any pullback.Bank Nifty continues to lead the market narrative with its remarkable strength. The index not only scaled a fresh all-time high last week but also posted gains for the fourth straight week, reaffirming the dominance of the ongoing bullish trend in the banking space.From a technical perspective, the momentum remains solid. The RSI across all major timeframes is firmly in the super-bullish zone and trending higher, signalling strong buying interest. On the weekly chart, Bank Nifty closed above the upper Bollinger Band, a rare and powerful indication of sustained upside momentum. Other key indicators echo this bullish setup, leaving little doubt about the prevailing strength.Going ahead, the index appears well-positioned to extend its northward march, with immediate targets at 60300, followed by 61000 in the short term. On the downside, the 58800–58700 zone, which coincides with the 20-day EMA, will act as a critical support in case of any pullback. With technical charts clearly favouring the bulls, Bank Nifty is likely to remain the driving force behind the market’s upward trajectory.360 One WAM has recovered steadily after taking strong support near its 200-day EMA zone of 1,060–1,050, with the price now trading above key short-term moving averages and closing above the upper Bollinger Band for two straight sessions. The rising MACD histogram, along with the MACD line positioned well above the zero line, indicates strong bullish momentum and a firmly positive trend.On the weekly chart, the stock has also delivered a downward-sloping trendline breakout supported by rising volumes over the past two weeks. Overall, the technical structure and indicator setup point toward the likelihood of further upside. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 1185-1175 with a stoploss of 1140. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 1260 in the short term.M&M hovered around its 20-day EMA for the past three sessions before witnessing strong buying on Friday accompanied by rising volumes. This successful hold of the 20-day EMA reinforces that the short-term uptrend remains intact. In the ADX indicator, the DI lines are widening, indicating strengthening directional momentum. Meanwhile, the RSI has moved above 60 and settled above, signalling increasing bullish strength.With supportive price action, improving momentum, and buyers regaining control at key support levels, the stock appears well-positioned for further upside in the near term. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 3760-3730 with a stoploss of 3600. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 4020 in the short term.","Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, says the top stock picks for this week are 360 ONE WAM, and Mahindra &Mahindra (M&M) Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty for the week starting December 1, 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125684645,imgsize-77164,width-400,resizemode-4/top-stocks-to-buy.jpg"

What are you actually afraid of?

I don’t understand this.

Jargon, charts, acronyms. When we don’t understand something, we assume danger.

Jargon, charts, acronyms. When we don’t understand something, we assume danger. I can’t afford a big loss.

The fear that one wrong step will wipe out years of saving.

The fear that one wrong step will wipe out years of saving. I don’t trust the system.

What the data quietly says

Zoom out, breathe easier

In the short term, ups and downs are routine.

Over 10–15 years, a diversified equity investment has usually rewarded patience.

The risk of doing “nothing”

Playing it too safe isn't safe at all

Meet Rajesh, the nervous first-timer

Some money in the bank, a couple of FDs.

Parents once bought a terrible product and lost money.

Rajesh has been “about to start an SIP” for three years, but every time he reads “markets at all-time high” or “crash coming”, he postpones it.

The safest path isn't always the straightest

First fix: protect yourself

Emergency fund Keep 3–6 months of expenses in a boring, easy-access place.

This is not for returns; it’s your “I can sleep at night” fund. Basic insurance Health insurance for hospital bills.

Term life insurance if others depend on your income.

Second fix: start small and boring

Start with an amount you can ignore emotionally. Even ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month is fine.

Use a simple, diversified fund—preferably a balanced / conservative hybrid if you’re very nervous, not a small-cap rocket.

Then let habit do the heavy lifting

Keep your emergency fund intact,

Pay your SIP on time, and

Not redeem every time there is a noisy headline, you’ve already done the hard part.

Increase your SIP as your income rises.

Gradually tilt more towards equity if your goals are 10–15 years away.

You don’t need courage. You need a plan.

Protect yourself from big shocks. Start with an amount and a product you can live with. Give time and compounding a chance to work.

(Dhirendra Kumar is Founder and CEO of Value Research)

If you’ve ever opened an investing app, seen a zig-zag line, felt your stomach drop and quietly closed it—congratulations, you are perfectly normal.You work hard for your money. You’ve heard horror stories about stock market losses, “this fund went down 20%,” and uncles who “lost everything” in some scheme. Then someone like me says, “Just start an SIP and think long term. ”Your brain reasonably replies: “Very nice. But what if I lose money?”Let’s separate feeling from fact.When people say “I’m scared of the market,” it’s usually a mix of:Scams, defaults, frauds—headline writers don’t go hungry.All fair worries. But the numbers tell a calmer story.Day-to-day, the market looks like a heart monitor. Over longer periods, it looks much more boring.The translation in plain English:There are no guarantees, but the risk of temporary loss is far higher than the risk of permanent loss—provided you behave sensibly.And then there is the villain we don’t see: inflation.Keeping all your money in savings and FDs feels safe. But “safe” here means “slowly losing purchasing power”.Not investing is also a decision about risk.Just not the one you think.Take a typical 32-year-old salaried worker in Delhi. Call him Rajesh.Even with a couple of bad years, the investing Rajesh ends up with a far larger corpus. The non-investing Rajesh feels safe but quietly loses opportunity.His fear of seeing temporary ups and downs is pushing him towards a permanent gap.If you’re genuinely scared of losing money, your first job is not to pick a mutual fund. It’s to make sure that one bad event doesn’t force you to sell at the worst time.Two simple steps:Once these are in place, the fear that “one illness / job loss will wipe me out” reduces sharply. You’re less likely to raid your investments in a panic.Your first investment should not try to impress you. It should try to survive you.During this period, do not stare at the NAV every day. Check once a quarter. Notice how you feel, but don’t act on every mood swing.The first 1–2 years are less about returns and more about training your nerves.If you manage to:From there, the upgrades are easy:Good investing is mostly this: boring, repeated, automated good behaviour.You don’t have to become a thrill-seeker to start investing. You don’t have to predict markets. You don’t have to enjoy risk.You just need to:Your fear is valid. Respect it. But don’t let it run the show.If you wait for a day when you feel zero fear, you may never start. If you start with a sensible plan despite the fear, that small, boring SIP might quietly turn into the bravest financial decision of your life.","Dhirendra Kumar: If you wait for a day when you feel zero fear, you may never start.

Jefferies initiated its coverage on Lenskart with a buy rating and the target price at Rs 500. Analysts said that Lenskart, India’s largest tech-driven eyewear retailer, holds just about 5% market share, offering strong growth potential. Its vertically integrated omni-channel model ensures cost efficiency, rapid delivery, and superior customer experience, they said. India serves as a bedrock for the company with over 85% contribution to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the international segment offers optionality. Analysts feel Lenskart offers attractive unit economics and fast paybacks should drive 50%+ adjusted EBITDA compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) between FY25 and FY28.Nomura has a buy rating on M&M with the target price at Rs 4,355. Analysts said that M&M launched a new 7-seater electric XEV 9S SUV on Nov 27 Nov at an introductory price of Rs 19.95 lakh. Bookings for the model will begin on Jan 14, 2026 and deliveries will start from Jan 23, 2026. XEV 9S comes with premium features and is priced much more attractively than expectations of Rs 23-31 lakh. XEV 9S is based on the INGLO platform and powered by MAIA.Kotak Institutional Equities has upgraded JSW Infrastructure to reduce from sell with the target price at Rs 270. Analysts said that the recent discussion about the company comforts them on prospects that it would leverage the group’s capabilities and requirements to generate a reasonable return on growth investments over the next five years. It also provides comforts on recovery in growth in Jaigarh by using pricing and investment levers to regain market share in Maharashtra. They feel that the key risk to the investment thesis is longevity and sustainability of growth, which lacks comfort for now. They also feel that the recent price correction still falls short of giving an attractive buy price point.UBS has a buy on GAIL with the target price at Rs 215. Analysts said that the recent tariff hike was disappointing while the increase in realized tariffs could be even lower. The 12% hike in announced tariffs does not mean equal increase in realized tariffs, they said. Current hike in tariffs reflects revision in only two parameters: Increase of Rs 5.16/mmbtu on account of higher system-use-gas, and the increase of Rs 1.92/mmbtu on account of lower volume divisor as per latest capacity determination. However, the regulator deferred the review of other parameters to FY28 (next tariff effective from 1 April 2028), flagging that a true-up of all parameters at this stage would lead to a material increase in tariff and can place some unexpected financial pressure on its customers.JP Morgan has an overweight rating on LIC with the target price at Rs 1,200. Analysts feel that the product mix shift, margin expansion, and distribution diversification would drive growth for the life insurance major. They also feel that the GST removal is likely to increase both the penetration and density of the insurance market. The company does not plan to pass on the cost benefit to distributors or customers, analysts said.","Lenskart, India’s largest tech-driven eyewear retailer, holds just about 5% market share, offering strong growth potential.

Delhi-NCR startups, by contrast, drew $2.4 billion, up 12% from $2.1 billion in the nine months of 2024 and 34% higher than $1.8 billion two years ago. Maharashtra companies raised $2 billion, an 11% rise over last year, though still below the $2.3 billion total in the nine months of 2023.The three regions diverged sharply by funding stage. Delhi-NCR's upswing was driven mainly by late-stage deals. Late-stage funding surged to $1.6 billion, up 77% from $920 million in the nine months of 2024 and 121% above $737 million in the nine months of 2023.

"Sebi move makes MF gifts easier, cheaper",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-move-makes-mf-gifts-easier-cheaper/articleshow/125683003.cms,"-

AHMEDABAD: A regulatory tweak by Sebi has opened the door to sizable tax savings for millions of mutual fund (MF) investors, simply by making it easier to gift their units.Tax experts say the reform, which now allows transfer of even statement of account (SOA)-based MF units and not just demat units, removes the biggest hurdle in gifting, inheritance and joint holding of mutual fund assets. Until now, investors could give only demat-held MF units; all others had to be redeemed and repurchased, triggering avoidable capital gains tax.Under the new rules, an investor sitting on sizable MF gains can transfer the units directly to a family member, typically an adult child or parent with little or no taxable income - and the recipient's gains could fall entirely within the Section 87A rebate limit.International tax expert Mukesh Patel called it a long-awaited and welcome reform.""If an individual has a Rs 10 lakh gain and gifts those units to an adult son or daughter who has no income, the entire gain can effectively be tax-free. Mutual funds have emerged as a key asset for Indian families, but gifting or inheritance processes were archaic,"" he said.""Even demat-held MF units could not be transferred in cases of inheritance or succession, forcing families to redeem and incur tax. If the head of a family passed away and his MF units were to be distributed between his two sons, there was no option but redemption.""With Sebi's new framework, both demat and SOA units can now be gifted or transferred with ease, whether under a Will, in cases of inheritance, or while adding or removing joint holders. Patel added that the provision opens a straightforward tax-planning route.Individuals in a higher tax slab can gift MF units to an adult family member not having taxable income. With Section 87A benefits, debt fund gains up to Rs 12 lakh can now be enjoyed fully tax-free.City-based financial adviser Mumukshu Desai said the impact has been immediate. ""The decision has been in the pipeline since April, and in the last 20 days alone, we've already handled four to five cases. Earlier, gifting mutual funds was theoretically permissible under income-tax rules, but practically impossible without selling the units. You had to sell and repurchase, and pay capital gains tax, just to execute a gift,"" he said. ""Now, with just a link and two OTPs, it's done.""Desai recalled instances where people sold MF holdings during marriages or festivals like Raksha Bandhan just to give money to siblings or children.""Now they can simply gift the units themselves. No sale, no exit load, no tax. You can add a holder, remove a holder, or include a parent or child with ease. The entire hassle of withdrawing units just to change the holding pattern has disappeared,"" he added.","A regulatory tweak by Sebi has opened the door to sizable tax savings for millions of mutual fund investors.

Starlink cannot compete with telcos in cities: Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/starlink-cannot-compete-with-telcos-in-cities-musk/articleshow/125682944.cms,"Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India

MUMBAI: Elon Musk said his satellite-based internet service Starlink is not meant for densely populated cities because the physics of satellite communication makes it unsuitable for that purpose, adding that it is designed to deliver connectivity to rural users and restore access after natural disasters rather than compete with urban broadband.Musk made the observation on Starlink's services, which he will be launching in India in partnership with Jio and Airtel, in a nearly two-hour conversation with Nikhil Kamath, founder of Zerodha, where he also predicted a future driven by rapid advances in AI and robotics. Musk said the future will involve a convergence of his companies, driven by solar-powered AI satellites in deep space.He expects communication to shift from text to real-time video with AI. On the philosophical foundations of AI, he said systems should be governed by ""truth, beauty and curiosity"", arguing that strict adherence to truth prevents unsafe reasoning. He also expressed concern about population decline, saying it reduces the scope of human consciousness.His broader comments on technology centred on AI and robotics, which he described as a ""supersonic tsunami"". He said working will become optional in under 20 years because automation will increase productivity to the point where AI satisfies all human needs.He also said this transition would trigger widespread deflation and eventually make money obsolete, since the cost of goods and services will approach zero.Musk said Starlink satellites fly in low-Earth orbit at around 550 km, and even if lowered to 350 km, they would still be too far from the ground to match city telecom infrastructure.""The physics is not on our side here,"" he said, explaining that a satellite beam functions like ""a flashlight"" and can support only a fixed number of users within its footprint. He said this makes it ""not physically possible for Starlink to serve densely populated cities"" beyond ""maybe 1% or 2%"", mainly in urban pockets without fibre.He said Starlink works with rather than against terrestrial networks, calling cell towers ""very good in cities"" but ""inefficient in the countryside"". According to him, rural areas face the weakest internet access because fibre rollout and high-bandwidth towers are expensive outside cities. ""Starlink tends to serve the least served,"" he said. He added that thousands of satellites linked through lasers keep the network running ""even if the cables are cut"", which becomes crucial when floods, fires or earthquakes damage ground infrastructure. Musk said SpaceX unlocks access during disasters because ""we don't want to put a paywall up while somebody's trying to get help"".",Elon Musk said his satellite-based internet service Starlink is not meant for densely populated cities.

A history of dramatic and contested predictions

Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has reignited debate over his long-running market warnings after posting on X that “the biggest crash in history” has already begun. His message paints a picture of an economy under pressure from rapid technological change and widening global instability. Citing an AI-driven erosion of jobs and deepening stress in real estate markets, Kiyosaki argues that the financial landscape is shifting far faster than most expect, and that only those who prepare for a more turbulent era will be able to shield themselves from the heavy losses he believes lie ahead. In the latest post, he adds that the “best option” for investors is silver, while also urging them to consider gold during volatility.Kiyosaki’s latest message draws directly from his 2002 book Rich Dad’s Prophecy, reprinted in 2013, where he predicted a historic market meltdown. His new post links the downturn to artificial intelligence, claiming job losses across the US, Europe and Asia are now triggering the market spiral he warned about more than two decades ago. He maintains that silver remains the “best option” for investors looking to protect themselves.Silver prices have continued climbing. As of 29 November 2025, the metal sits at about $56.70 per ounce, a 13 percent increase from the $50 level Kiyosaki referenced on 23 November. Yet major market indicators tell a more measured story. The S&P 500 has dipped roughly 5 percent from recent highs, suggesting turbulence but not the total global crash Kiyosaki describes.Kiyosaki has made bold crash forecasts repeatedly, including several in 2025 that did not unfold as predicted. His latest warning has sparked scepticism and online pushback, with figures like Grant Cardone publicly dismissing the claims. Still, the post taps into a broader and unresolved debate over AI’s economic impact and whether today’s volatility is a temporary shock or the beginning of something far more severe.","Robert Kiyosaki has reignited debate over his long-running market warnings.

India Says US Trade Deal Is 'Only Matter Of Time' As Tariffs Reshape Bilateral Trade Negotiations

US President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his sweeping tariff regime, saying the duties had made the country “Rich, Strong, Powerful, and Safe,” in a post on his Truth Social account.Trump argued that because of the tariff framework he “set in place,” the United States now holds “all the cards,” asserting that the measures had stopped wars, strengthened alliances and prevented other nations from “ripping off the United States anymore.”He claimed the stock market and retirement savings had surged, adding that “Inflation, Prices and Taxes are down,” and that education was “being brought back to the States.”Trump also said the US military and southern border were “the strongest they have ever been,” contending that the country is “respected again, respected like never before.”He attributed these outcomes to what he described as “Strong leadership and tariffs.”The president’s remarks come at a sensitive moment, as the Supreme Court is preparing to rule on the extent of presidential authority to impose duties without congressional approval.Tariff revenues have climbed sharply in recent months, as per Fox Business, reaching a record $34.2 billion in October.Total duty collections were $215.2 billion in fiscal year 2025, and the Treasury has reported $41.6 billion in revenue so far in fiscal 2026.Since Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, collections jumped from $23.9 billion in May to $29 billion in July, with August and September together bringing in $62.6 billion, reported Fox Business.US businesses pay these import taxes but often pass on the costs to consumers, though Trump has recently lifted some duties to ease price pressures.Trump has pledged that tariff revenues could finance a one-time $2,000 dividend for low- and middle-income households.As per Fox Business, US trade representative Jamieson Greer recently said that the payments would not fuel inflation, stressing they would provide “welcome relief” without altering the broader economic outlook.Trump ended his post by urging Americans to “pray to God” that the Supreme Court “do the right thing for America.”","US President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his sweeping tariff regime.

Retailers say shoppers have grown more selective and deal-focused, even as they continue to spend on big seasonal moments, creating what executives describe as a “halo effect”.“Consumers have been saying the economy is terrible while continuing to spend for years now, so the outlook is probably better than they are telling us,” Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, said ahead of Black Friday.At Macy’s Herald Square in New York City, early-morning crowds searched for steep discounts on shoes, clothing, linens and cosmetics after doors opened at 6 a.m. Footwear — marked down by 40–50% — was among the busiest sections. But unlike in past years, the atmosphere was calm.Veronica Nam, 68, picked up Nike sneakers for her husband and spent $256 on Lacoste bedding she estimated was half-price. She said she would wait until after Christmas to buy gifts for other relatives amid fluctuating tariffs under President Donald Trump and several years of elevated prices.“Food is very expensive,” she said.Nearby, 19-year-old Nicholas Menasche was shopping with his mother before heading to Best Buy for video games. The banking intern plans to spend around $1,200 this holiday season — roughly the same as last year. “I’m here to buy stuff. Shoes and clothes,” he said. “It’s a great tradition. The stores are open really early.”Retailers spent spring and summer navigating tariff unpredictability, shifting shipments ahead of import taxes and absorbing some costs to avoid raising prices. Circana data showed 40% of general merchandise in September saw price hikes of at least 5% versus early 2025. Toys, housewares, baby products and sports gear were especially affected; 83% of toys saw at least a 5% price rise. Nearly 80% of US toy sales involve items made in China — a sector hit with steep Trump-era tariffs.Still, malls and analysts reported strong momentum heading into Black Friday. At Minnesota’s Mall of America, foot traffic has exceeded 2019 pre-pandemic levels in recent weeks, said Jill Renslow, the mall’s chief business development and marketing officer. “We’re seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,” she said. “The last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.”Online spending is also growing briskly. Between Nov. 1 and Nov. 23, consumers spent $79.7 billion, Adobe Analytics said — up 7.5% from a year earlier and ahead of its 5.3% forecast.Mastercard SpendingPulse projects holiday sales from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24 will rise 3.6%, compared with last year’s 4.1%.“Clearly, there’s uncertainty,” Mastercard Chief Economist Michelle Meyer said. “Clearly, consumers feel on edge. But at the moment, it doesn’t seem like it’s changing how they are showing up for this season.”","Black Friday draws more in-store traffic than any other day of the year.

Growth rebound: Canada posts 2.6% Q3 GDP surge; stronger trade and govt spending drive recovery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/growth-rebound-canada-posts-2-6-q3-gdp-surge-stronger-trade-and-govt-spending-drive-recovery/articleshow/125640734.cms,"India, Canada Restart Trade Talks, Aim For $50-Bn Trade By 2030 As Pm Modi Meets Mark Carney

Canada’s economy staged a stronger-than-expected recovery in the third quarter of 2025, expanding 2.6 per cent year-on-year after a contraction in the previous quarter, according to new data from Statistics Canada, AFP reported.The rebound was fuelled by an improved trade balance and higher government spending, offsetting the drag from US President Donald Trump’s trade war, which has weighed on Canadian growth and clouded the country’s trade outlook.CIBC economist Katherine Judge said the print “was well above the consensus forecast,” noting that analysts had broadly expected growth of around 0.5 per cent.Statistics Canada said the improvement was led by declines in imports alongside a slight uptick in exports. “Imports dropped and exports edged up. Increased capital investment was driven by government capital spending, as business investment was flat,” the agency said.The drop in imports was the largest since 2022, the agency added.A sharp rise in federal outlays also contributed to the growth momentum, with government spending on weapons systems surging 82 per cent. Since taking office in March, Prime Minister Mark Carney has prioritised upgrading Canada’s ageing military hardware, arguing that significant investments are essential for meeting NATO spending targets and safeguarding sovereignty amid rising threats, including from Russia in the Arctic.","Canada's economy staged a stronger-than-expected recovery in the third quarter of 2025, expanding 2.6 per cent year-on-year.

German chemical major Wacker Chemie on Thursday announced plans to cut 1,500 jobs, nearly a tenth of its global workforce, as the industry faces one of its toughest periods in decades.The company said most of the reductions will take place in Germany, with the process to be completed by the end of 2027, according to AFP.The job cuts form part of a broader plan to save more than 300 million euros ($348 million) annually. Wacker employs around 16,600 people worldwide, most of them based in Germany. Its customer base spans the automotive, construction and semiconductor sectors — all of which have been hit by slowing demand and rising competition.Shares of Wacker Chemie rose nearly 2 percent in Frankfurt after the announcement.Chief executive Christian Hartel said the operating environment for chemical firms in Germany needed urgent improvement. “The excessively high energy prices and bureaucratic obstacles continue to act as a central brake on the successful development of the chemical industry,” he said.The company had reported a net loss of more than 80 million euros in the third quarter, citing weak demand and mounting competition, particularly from China.Earlier this month, Germany’s VCI chemical industry association warned that production in the sector had slipped to a three-decade low, reflecting the broader strain on traditional industries as the country struggles to emerge from two years of recession.","Wacker Chemie announces plans to cut 1,500 jobs, nearly a tenth of its global workforce.

Hong Kong Fire Out Of Control: Over 100 Casualties, Hundreds Missing; 3 Held For Manslaughter

China Taiping's insurance exposure



'Seriously underinsured'

China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co. shares fell sharply on Thursday amid concerns over its exposure to a Hong Kong construction project linked to a devastating high-rise fire that has killed at least 44 people and left hundreds missing.The stock slid as much as 8.1% in early trading before trimming losses to about 2% by late morning in Hong Kong. Firefighters continued battling the massive blaze on Thursday, nearly 18 hours after it tore through parts of the densely populated Wang Fuk Court estate in Tai Po.The disaster was the city's worst fire in decades, which erupted suddenly on Wednesday afternoon and rapidly engulfed several sections of the 32-storey complex, home to roughly 2,000 units.Authorities have arrested three men, saying flammable materials left behind during maintenance work had allowed the fire “to spread rapidly beyond control.”The buildings had been wrapped in bamboo scaffolding, a traditional but highly flammable material still widely used in Hong Kong.The fire began around 2:50 pm on Wednesday, with the estate under repair and wrapped in bamboo scaffolding, flames spread rapidly through the eight-building complex.The precise cause remains unknown, but officials believe leftover flammable material from maintenance work played a major role in the fire’s fast escalation. Rescue operations and investigations are ongoing.China Taiping underwrote third-party liability and employee compensation for mandatory building and window inspection work at the complex, Bloomberg reported.The HK$316 million (US$41 million) project, which used bamboo scaffolding and protective netting, is now part of an ongoing investigation into the cause of the disaster.The insurer’s policy covers the full contract sum plus an additional HK$50 million (US$6.4 million) for accidents, and provides HK$200 million in employee compensation. Separately, the company holds a general property-all-risk policy worth HK$2 billion.According to Bloomberg, Hong Kong Insurance Professionals Federation chairman Philip Mak said both the general all-risk policy and the construction-specific coverage are “seriously underinsured” given the scale of the multi-tower estate.Mak noted that rebuilding communal areas and replacing elevator steel cables will likely exceed the insured amounts. Individual flat owners may claim death or injury benefits under the HK$50 million accident portion, but he warned the sum is “nowhere near enough” in light of the number of deaths and the hundreds still unaccounted for.",China Taiping Insurance Holdings Co. shares fell sharply on Thursday amid concerns over its exposure to a Hong Kong construction project.

The factors influencing turkey prices this Thanksgiving

Grocery stores in the US are absorbing the rising cost of turkeys this Thanksgiving. A spike in bird flu cases has pushed up wholesale prices, according to new data from the US department of agriculture (USDA). But these higher costs are not being passed on to shoppers.USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year. Experts say stores are taking the hit to keep customers coming in, reported NBC News. Even the projected cost of a full Thanksgiving meal has stayed broadly steady.The main reason for the higher costs is a drop in supply. Bird flu has spread again among commercial poultry farms this autumn. By October, more than 2 million turkeys had been culled after exposure. Minnesota, the largest turkey-producing state, reported six confirmed outbreaks that month.David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University, told NBC, another virus avian metapneumovirus is also affecting production by reducing the number of viable eggs laid by hens. This has slowed farmers’ efforts to rebuild their flocks.Overall, turkey supply is tightening. The USDA expects production to fall to 4.8 million pounds this year, down from 5.1 million pounds in 2024.This shortage has pushed up costs for retailers. USDA data shows the wholesale price of frozen turkeys, the type most families buy for Thanksgiving, has jumped by about 80% since last year, rising from under $1 per pound to more than $1.70.A separate USDA report shows retail prices for frozen turkeys staying flat. Ortega said shops may be absorbing these increases to stop customers from switching stores. Retailers often use turkeys as a “loss leader”, selling them at or below cost to draw in shoppers and make up the difference through other items in their baskets.While turkey prices have stayed stable for shoppers, the overall cost of a Thanksgiving meal varies depending on the data source. Some estimates show prices rising by nearly 10%, while others show a fall of up to 5%.",USDA figures show that advertised turkey prices in supermarkets are roughly the same as last year.

Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Seoul, Taipei and Jakarta all traded higher. Wellington and Manila lagged.This upswing comes after markets stumbled earlier in the month over fears that the tech-driven surge of recent years had overheated, and returns from heavy AI investments would take time to materialise. For now, those concerns have been overshadowed by the prospect of lower borrowing costs, which are seen as a bigger support for a broader range of companies, including smaller caps.Bitcoin, which had slumped to a seven-month low just above $80,000 during the recent market turmoil, climbed back above $90,000 as risk appetite improved.

AAA projects 81.8 million Thanksgiving travellers

Americans are set for a mix of family meals and early holiday shopping this week, with most big retailers staying shut on Thanksgiving before reopening at dawn for Black Friday, the unofficial start of the Christmas buying rush. The week also marks what AAA says will be the busiest Thanksgiving travel period on record, according to AP report.Most national retailers — including Walmart, Target, Macy’s, Kohl’s and Costco — will remain closed on Thursday, returning with early openings from 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. on Black Friday. CVS will shut early, and Walgreens will close most stores except select 24-hour locations. Grocery chains will open but many will close ahead of schedule, with timings varying by area.Government offices, post offices, courts and schools will be closed. US banks and stock markets will also shut for the day, reopening on Friday for a shortened trading session that ends at 1 p.m. Eastern. Standard FedEx and UPS pickup and delivery services will not operate on Thursday, though limited critical services will be available at certain locations.With schools closed and a long weekend ahead, travel is expected to surge.AAA estimates that 81.8 million people will journey at least 50 miles between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1 — 1.6 million more than last year and a potential new record. Nearly 73 million will travel by car, aided by petrol prices holding near $3 a gallon, slightly below last Thanksgiving’s average.About 6 million Americans are expected to fly domestically, a 2% rise from 2024, though cancellations or delays could shift the final count. Another 2.5 million travellers will rely on buses, trains or cruise ships, marking an 8.5% increase from last year.For many households, Thursday offers a quiet holiday — before the weekend turns into one of the year’s busiest on the roads, at airports and at shop entrances.","AAA projects 81.8 million Thanksgiving travellers.

Zoom in: Burry’s beef isn’t with Nvidia’s books-but its customers’



The big picture: A new bubble with a familiar face



What they're saying: Nvidia responds, Burry doubles down



What’s next



Michael Burry, the investor famed for betting against the US housing market in “The Big Short,” is now shorting Nvidia and Palantir-two flagbearers of the AI rally. In a blistering Substack post, Burry dismissed Nvidia’s internal memo rebutting his concerns as “disingenuous on the face, and disappointing. ”He accused the world’s most valuable company of deflecting criticism with “one straw man after another,” charging that Nvidia’s response failed to engage with his actual concerns around depreciation assumptions in the AI ecosystem. The fresh attack comes as investors increasingly debate whether the AI boom has tipped into bubble territory, a Business Insider report said.The criticism comes at a critical moment: Nvidia stock has dropped 14% from its early-November peak, and broader questions are emerging over whether AI’s gold rush has entered speculative territory.Burry’s remarks tap into mounting investor unease-not about innovation, but about how profits are being propped up by accounting choices that may not age well as chip cycles shorten.Burry clarified that he never accused Nvidia of stretching out the depreciation of its own factories or equipment. “No one cares about Nvidia’s own depreciation,” he wrote. “One straw man burnt.”Instead, he zeroed in on cloud giants-Microsoft, Meta, Oracle-who are reportedly extending chip and server depreciation timelines from 3 years to 5 or 6.That, Burry says, lets them spread massive AI hardware costs over longer periods, inflating earnings now while kicking losses down the road.He cited a Microsoft interview in which Satya Nadella said the company slowed data center buildouts to avoid overbuilding for one generation of AI chips-a move Burry sees as confirmation that tech’s depreciation timelines may be out of sync with reality.“The hyperscalers have been systematically increasing the useful lives of chips and servers, for depreciation purposes,” Burry warned.Burry says today’s AI surge echoes the dot-com bubble-just with faster hardware, loftier assumptions, and bigger accounting risks. He compared Nvidia to Cisco circa 2000, the centerpiece of tech euphoria before the crash.“There is a Cisco at the center of it all,” he wrote. “Its name is Nvidia.”In a particularly stark forecast, Burry predicted tech companies could understate depreciation by $176 billion between 2026 and 2028, warning that Meta, Oracle and others could overstate earnings by 20–27% if timelines aren't adjusted.Nvidia disputed Burry’s math, especially around its stock buybacks. The company clarified that it has repurchased $91 billion in shares since 2018-not $112.5 billion as Burry implied-and said he mistakenly included RSU-related taxes.Nvidia also defended its GPU longevity, arguing chips like the A100 (released in 2020) are still in full use, justifying longer depreciation periods.Burry remains unmoved. “I stand by my analysis,” he posted on X. “Obviously, the full analysis does not fit in a tweet.”Burry disclosed he still holds put options on both Nvidia and Palantir, despite the market’s growing appetite for all things AI. He claimed they cost about $10 million each-not the $1.1 billion their notional value implied.He’s now using his new paywalled newsletter, “Cassandra Unchained,” to argue that this AI cycle isn’t just about tech-it’s also about the accounting scaffolding propping it up.“I have been drawn into something much bigger than me,” he wrote.If he’s right again, this won’t be the last straw man he sets alight.(With inputs from agencies)","Michael Burry, the investor famed for betting against the US housing market in ‘The Big Short,’ is now shorting Nvidia and Palantir.

The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107262111,imgsize-64556,width-400,resizemode-4/107262111.jpg"
Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

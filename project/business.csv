The proposed amendments

Raising foreign direct investment in the insurance sector from 74 per cent to 100 per cent, while mandating that at least one of the top executives, the chairman, managing director, or chief executive officer, must be an Indian citizen.

Introducing sector-specific licences, allowing insurers to operate in specialised segments such as cyber, property, or marine insurance, with the government empowered to notify additional classes of business in consultation with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA).

Allowing mergers between insurance and non-insurance companies.

Moving away from detailed statutory provisions to a regulation-led framework, granting IRDA the authority to prescribe operational norms—including capital requirements, solvency margins, and investment conditions—through regulations rather than Parliamentary legislation.

Empowering IRDA to set limits on commissions and remuneration for insurance agents.

Creating a Policyholders’ Education and Protection Fund, to be financed through penalties levied on insurers.

Expanding the definition of insurance intermediaries to include entities such as insurance repositories.

Easing licensing norms for surveyors and loss assessors, with regulatory oversight replacing statutory control.

Allowing the Life Insurance Corporation of India to set up zonal offices without prior Central government approval and permitting its overseas branches to maintain funds abroad.

Providing for a five-year tenure for the IRDA chairperson and other whole-time members, or until they attain the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier.

NEW DELHI: The Parliament on Wednesday cleared the new insurance bill that allows 100% FDI. The ""Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha Bill"" was passed in Rajya Sabha, a day after getting Lok Sabha's nod.This comes despite several Rajya Sabha opposition members' demands that it's referred to a Parliamentary committee fir further scrutiny. The members also objected to the Bill’s title, noting that it uses both English and Hindi.The debate on the bill began after being moved by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for consideration. The bill, cleared by Union Cabinet earlier aims to transform India’s insurance sector, making coverage access easier and facilitating universal protection by 2047. This will include major changes, lined up for the Insurance Act, 1938, the LIC Act, 1956, and the IRDA Act, 1999.Also read: Lok Sabha clears 'SHANTI' bill as opposition walks out; paves way for entry of private players Sitharaman had first talked about this bill in her budget speech in February.

Indian equity benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , ended higher on Friday, tracking positive global cues. While Nifty50 settled close to the 26,000 mark, the BSE Sensex jumped nearly 450 points. At the close, Nifty50 settled at 25,966.40, up 150.85 points or 0.58%, while the BSE Sensex ended at 84,929.36, gaining 447.55 points or 0.53%.After experiencing weakness, the Nifty index appeared to stabilize with a slight downward trend on Thursday. Analysts suggest that the market's short-term trend remains volatile with a weak bias.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “FIIs stopping selling during the last two days, though positive from the market perspective, doesn’t indicate a directional change in the market. A lot will depend on the Bank of Japan’s rate decision today. It is almost certain that BoJ will raise rates by 25bp and, therefore, such a decision is unlikely to impact the market. What the market is looking for is commentary from the Japanese central bank regarding future rate action in the context of inflation in Japan. If the BoJ chief sends a hawkish message indicating more rate hikes, that would impact the market since the market will fear further unwinding of the yen carry trade, triggering more FII outflows from markets like India.Therefore, watch out for the BoJ commentary.”“Meanwhile, cooling inflation in the US ( November core inflation has come at 2.6%, lower than the estimate of 3%) is imparting resilience to the US economy and markets. This augurs well for global equity markets as 2025 draws to a close.”Asian stocks rose on Friday following a report of cooling US inflation, which bolstered the case for potential interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. This, along with easing concerns in the tech sector, supported gains in US stocks.On Wall Street, the main indexes ended higher on Thursday. A soft inflation report fueled expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, while a strong forecast from chipmaker Micron indicated robust demand for AI technology.The Consumer Price Index showed that consumer prices rose less than anticipated over the year to November. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics did not release month-to-month CPI changes due to the 43-day government shutdown, which disrupted the collection of October data.On Thursday, foreign portfolio investors purchased shares worth Rs 596 crore. Domestic institutional investors were also net buyers, acquiring shares worth Rs 2,700 crore.","Indian equity benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex ended higher on Friday, tracking positive global cues.

Hakeem Jeffries Explodes At Trump, Johnson, Dems Refuse To ‘BEND THE KNEE’ Over Obamacare Crisis

US President Donald Trump on Friday announced agreements with nine major pharmaceutical companies to lower prescription drug prices in the United States, marking a significant push to align domestic costs with those paid in other rich countries.The companies include Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.Under the deals, the drugmakers will rein in prices for medicines sold through Medicaid, charging rates comparable to what they levy in other wealthy nations.New drugs launched by these companies will also follow “most-favored-nation” pricing across all markets, including commercial insurance, cash-pay customers, Medicare and Medicaid, according to news agency AP.Trump said the agreements would end a system in which US patients paid far more than the rest of the world. “We were subsidising the entire world. We’re not doing it anymore,” he said at a White House press conference, according to Reuters.US prescription drug prices are often nearly three times higher than those in other developed countries.The companies also agreed to list pharmacy-ready medicines on a new direct-to-consumer platform, TrumpRx, set to launch in January, allowing patients to buy drugs directly from manufacturers.As per Reuters, some firms will offer discounts of up to 70% on select medicines, although analysts noted that Medicaid already receives steep rebates.Bristol Myers Squibb said it would provide its blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis free to Medicaid, a move described by health economist William Padula as “a thoughtful health equity move,” as per AP.Several companies also pledged to donate active pharmaceutical ingredients to a national reserve for use during emergencies.Markets reacted positively, with shares of most participating drugmakers rising, Reuters said, as the agreements also grant a three-year exemption from threatened pharmaceutical tariffs in return for commitments to invest in US manufacturing.Trump said he had warned companies of possible tariffs to push them to “do the right thing,” AP reported.According to CNBC, the administration has now secured pricing agreements with 14 of the 17 drugmakers it approached earlier this year, with negotiations continuing with the remaining firms.","US President Donald Trump on Friday announced agreements with nine major pharmaceutical companies to lower prescription drug prices in the United States.

Rupee continues to rebound!

Rupee continued its upward rally against the US dollar on Friday, strengthening past its 90 mark to reach 89.96 against US dollar in early trade. The currency opened at 90.1325 per dollar, up about 0.1% from its previous close of 90.20 against US dollar. This comes after Rupee made a tentative recovery after sliding to record lows earlier this week, even depreciating to the 91 level against US dollar.This rebound was largely attributed to intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which stepped in to sell dollars after the currency came under intense and sustained pressure. Bankers said the apex bank's intervention was aimed at disrupting the one-way depreciation that had built up in the market, triggering unwinding of bearish positions.Market participants noted that the RBI’s latest move was similar to its approach in October and November. Back then, it had intervened multiple times to counter persistent weakness in the currency, selling dollars heavily in both the spot and non-deliverable forward (NDF) markets.Meanwhile, State Bank of India (SBI) has also projected a strong rebound in rupee in the latter half of the next financial year, expecting the recovery to take shape between October 2026 and March 2027, according to its latest report.The country’s largest lender said that its outlook is based on historical currency trends and internal analysis, which suggest that the current phase of weakness is not structural. The report noted that rupee has undergone multiple cycles of depreciation and appreciation in the past and is likely to move out of the present downtrend in the second half of the next fiscal year.","Rupee continued its upward rally against the US dollar on Friday, strengthening past its 90 mark.

'Don’t travel’: Google and Apple warn visa workers against overseas travel amid US immigration crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dont-travel-google-and-apple-warn-visa-workers-against-overseas-travel-amid-us-immigration-crackdown/articleshow/126100671.cms,"Google and Apple advised US-based employees on work visas not to travel internationally after their outside counsel warned of delays of up to 12 months at US embassies and consulates worldwide amid the immigration crackdown, documents reviewed by Business Insider show.On Thursday, BAL Immigration Law, which represents Google, sent a memo stating, “Please be aware that some US Embassies and Consulates are experiencing significant visa stamping appointment delays, currently reported as up to 12 months.” It added that employees would “risk an extended stay outside the US” if they travelled without a valid stamp.Last week Fragomen, acting for Apple, issued a similar warning. “Given the recent updates and the possibility of unpredictable, extended delays when returning to the US, we strongly recommend that employees without a valid H-1B visa stamp avoid international travel for now,” the memo said. “If travel cannot be postponed, employees should connect with Apple Immigration and Fragomen in advance to discuss the risks. ”American consulates and embassies around the world have reported routine visa appointment delays since the introduction of a new social media screening requirement, which applies to H-1B visa workers and their dependents, as well as students and exchange visitors. A Department of State spokesperson told Business Insider on Friday that it was conducting “online presence reviews for applicants.”The spokesperson said appointments may be moved as resources change, and applicants can request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.“While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,” the spokesperson added. Immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC reported that appointments in Ireland and Vietnam had also been postponed.Google’s memo noted that H-1B, H-4, F, J and M visa stamping was affected. Neither company’s advisory addressed how individuals already abroad with postponed appointments should proceed. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.A Department of State spokesperson emphasised that consular officers “do not issue a visa unless the applicant can credibly demonstrate they meet all requirements under US law — including that they intend to engage only in activities consistent with the terms of their visa.”The H-1B programme, capped at 85,000 new visas a year, serves as a key pipeline for employers hiring skilled foreign workers. Under the Trump administration the programme became a political flashpoint, with critics and some employers arguing that new policies—including a Rs 83 lakh fee on new H-1B visas (approx)—have made it harder and more expensive to hire overseas talent.During the 2024 govt fiscal year Alphabet, Google’s parent company, applied for 5,537 H-1B visas, while Apple applied for 3,880, according to Business Insider’s analysis of Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services data.",Google and Apple advised US-based employees on work visas not to travel internationally.

"US labour market: After affordability concerns, America faces its next hurdle — a ‘stagnating’ job landscape",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-labour-market-after-affordability-concerns-america-faces-its-next-hurdle-a-stagnating-job-landscape/articleshow/126100613.cms,"The US labour market continues to lose steam, with the latest jobs report showing a sharp slowdown in hiring. While November’s data was affected by shutdown-related distortions, economists say the broader trend is clear: job creation has settled into a prolonged low gear.Though employers are still adding workers, the pace of hiring is among the weakest recorded in the past two decades. The unemployment rate ticked higher, driven in part by more Americans entering the workforce without finding jobs. At the same time, long-term unemployment increased, the number of discouraged workers grew, and economic gaps widened further, CNN reported.“Hiring, while certainly not on a freeze, is on hold; and people that have jobs are absolutely holding on to them with white knuckles,” said Dan North, Allianz Trade’s senior economist for North America.“I see that as definitely a labor market that’s stagnating,” North further told CNN.Despite the slowdown in hiring, the broader US economy has not slipped into contraction. Economic growth remains steady and productivity levels have held up. Average monthly job gains stand at roughly 55,000, a figure that reflects heightened uncertainty around trade policy, immigration rules and the broader political environment.Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN that structural changes in the workforce are also reshaping employment dynamics. As Baby Boomers retire and immigration faces additional restrictions, the overall supply of labour is shrinking. As a result, the economy no longer needs to generate as many jobs each month to remain stable.“My estimate is that we need to hire 50,000 a month to keep the labor market conditions stable,” Brusuelas told CNN. Under such conditions, economic growth could remain close to 2%, financial conditions would stay supportive, and inflation pressures may ease somewhat.From a purely economic standpoint, Brusuelas said, this scenario is sustainable and could persist for years. However, he warned that the benefits of stability would not be evenly shared. In a K-shaped economy, higher-income households are likely to continue benefiting from growth, while lower-income groups face increasing strain as hiring slows.Looking ahead, economists see multiple forces that could push the labour market in different directions. One major unknown is artificial intelligence and how quickly it might alter employment patterns. In the short term, uncertainty around AI adoption is making companies cautious about expanding their workforce, according to economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, cited by CNN.“The longer-term implications for labor displacement and wage dynamics, however, remain an open question,” Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, wrote in a note this week.AI, combined with tougher immigration enforcement and unresolved policy questions, is acting as a drag on labour market growth, said Tyler Schipper, associate professor of economics at St. Thomas University in Minnesota.“The question I ask myself is, ‘ What would be the conditions in which I think the labor market would ramp back up?’ and some of those are policy-related,” he said. “I have a hard time seeing those resolving themselves anytime soon.”“For better or worse, I think we could be in this K-shaped economy for some time,” Schipper added. “And I think the way out of it probably is that there’s a recession before things get better, which is never what you want to hear if you’re on the lower leg of the K.”Others believe the slowdown may not be permanent. Cory Stahle, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, said hiring could eventually accelerate, though the process is likely to be slow.“The US labor market is like a pretty big ship turned by a rudder,” he told CNN. “Sometimes it takes a little time to turn around.”Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could help stimulate hiring, though their impact typically takes three to five quarters to filter through the economy. Reduced uncertainty, whether through policy clarity or economic stability, could also encourage employers to loosen their grip on hiring plans.For now, uncertainty remains a dominant force. Businesses continue to grapple with unanswered questions around interest rates, prices, government policy and the tax law set to take effect in the upcoming year, Brusuelas noted.","The US labour market continues to lose steam, with the latest jobs report showing a sharp slowdown in hiring.

Electricity Bill consultation: Power minister discusses draft amendments with MPs; stakeholder feedback underway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/electricity-bill-consultation-power-minister-discusses-draft-amendments-with-mps-stakeholder-feedback-underway/articleshow/126095093.cms,"Power Minister Manohar Lal has held consultations with a panel of Members of Parliament on the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2025, as the government seeks feedback on changes aimed at strengthening India’s power sector framework, PTI reported.MPs from various political parties in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha participated in the meeting of the Parliamentary Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Power, held in New Delhi on Thursday, the ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The consultation was convened to discuss key provisions of the draft Bill, which has been placed in the public domain for stakeholder feedback.The discussions come amid opposition from power sector employees. The All India Power Engineers Federation (AIPEF) has announced demonstrations on December 23 against the proposed amendments and has extended support to a nationwide strike called by central trade unions and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, protesting labour law changes and demanding a legally guaranteed minimum support price for crops.Chairing the meeting, the minister said the Bill seeks to strengthen the legislative foundation of the power sector.He noted that the proposals aim to mandate cost-reflective tariffs and empower regulatory commissions to act suo motu when utilities delay tariff filings. He clarified that state governments may continue to provide subsidies to priority consumer groups such as domestic and agricultural users, and said the changes would not lead to higher costs for such consumers.According to the statement, the Bill also seeks to reduce distortions caused by cross-subsidies and surcharges to improve the competitiveness of Indian industry, including MSMEs, and support job creation. The minister emphasised the need to ensure reasonable electricity costs for industry.The draft legislation proposes to empower State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, in consultation with state governments, to exempt distribution companies from supplying large consumers. It also introduces a minimum obligation for using non-fossil fuel-based electricity and enables renewable capacity addition through market mechanisms alongside DISCOM agreements, with the aim of easing financial stress on utilities.Operational reforms proposed include incorporating Right-of-Way provisions in the Act and enabling distribution network sharing to avoid duplication, which the minister said would benefit consumers.Responding to concerns, Lal said apprehensions about privatisation, higher costs or adverse impacts on employees were unfounded and that safeguards would be in place.However, AIPEF chairman Shailendra Dubey has charged that the amendments could eliminate subsidies and cross-subsidies for farmers and poor domestic consumers, leading to higher electricity bills.","Power Minister Manohar Lal held consultations with a panel of Members of Parliament on the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2025.

Of these, 46 per cent expect prices to rise in the 5–10 per cent range, while 18 per cent see appreciation between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. Around 3 per cent of respondents forecast a sharper rise of 15–25 per cent, and 1 per cent expect prices to climb by more than 25 per cent.Only 25 per cent of developers believe price growth will be below 5 per cent, while 8 per cent expect negative growth in housing prices.The survey report was released during a CREDAI conclave held in New Delhi on December 19–20.Beyond pricing, the survey indicated a broadly positive outlook for the residential segment in 2026. Nearly two-thirds of developers said they expect demand for homes to grow by more than 5 per cent in the coming year, reflecting continued end-user interest rather than speculative buying.Commenting on the findings, CREDAI president Shekhar G Patel said the survey shows that growth in the housing market is increasingly anchored in genuine demand. “The sector is witnessing a calibrated approach to new supply, with stronger emphasis on cost efficiency through technology adoption and closer alignment between product offerings and evolving homebuyer preferences,” Patel said.He added that faster project approvals and greater regulatory clarity would be critical to sustaining the momentum. “Streamlined clearances can unlock the next phase of housing supply across markets, support timely project delivery, and enable more balanced and sustainable urban growth,” Patel said.Abhishek Kiran Gupta, CEO and co-founder of CRE Matrix and IndexTap, said the findings point to steady demand expectations, disciplined supply addition and a sharper focus on long-term value creation in the residential real estate sector.CREDAI represents more than 13,000 real estate developers across the country.","Nearly 70 per cent of real estate developers expect housing prices to rise by more than 5 per cent during the 2026 calendar year, according to a sentiment survey.

Global gold demand touched a record 1,313 tonnes in the July–September quarter of 2025, the report said.“India has recorded its highest gold ETF inflows on record this year. The 2026 outlook (for gold) stays moderately to strongly positive,” PL Capital said.Silver, meanwhile, has significantly outperformed gold, gaining over 100 per cent in 2025 and crossing the USD 60 per ounce mark.

A fan called Tom Brady’s $3 million watch gift to son, a massive house on wrist

Benjamin Rein Brady needs some motivation to be great

Dov Kleiman recently shared a heartwarming flashback moment between a loving father and humble son on X. He captioned it: “𝗧𝗥𝗘𝗡𝗗𝗜𝗡𝗚: The legendary Tom Brady surprised his 15-year-old son with a $3 MILLION Jacob & Co watch. “What a fantastic father and role model ❤️🥹.” The video is from February 2025. Brady shared it on his YouTube channel, ‘The Super Bowl.’ In the video, Tom Brady says, “Alright, Benny, close your eyes. Put your wrist up. Don’t let your boys [Benny’s friends] look. Close your eyes too. Don’t look. Don’t look.” As Brady puts the $3 million glistening Jacob & Co. watch on his son’s wrist, Benjamin says, “It feels shiny.”The person recording the video asks, “Is it heavy, Benny?” Benjamin chuckles and repeats, “It feels shiny.” Brady then tells him, “Okay, look.” The moment Brady had been waiting for finally happened. “WHOA!” his son reacted. Brady can be heard laughing in the background. Someone else says, “Benny’s iced out!” In Shedeur Sanders’ terms, “iced out” means to wear a watch or chain covered in diamonds or other precious gemstones. Sanders is always seen sporting massive diamond jewelry.Now, how did cyberspace react to this adorable moment between father and son? Let’s read on.“Just a massive house on his wrist 😳,” wrote a fan. Another shared their purchasing-a-watch story: “I'm a brokie - bought myself a Stuhrling on Black Friday from Macy's for 80% off.” A user felt happy for the father-son duo, saying: “The goat making sure the youngin iced out🤝.” Another found the watch gaudy and did not want to share parenting tips: “Good Lord, that's a gaudy watch. I have some thoughts about this from a parenting perspective too. But I'll keep them to myself.”About the watch: Jacob & Co. Billionaire Mini Ashoka. The watch is estimated to be worth $3 million. It is one of only 18 pieces in the world. It features a white gold case and bracelet encrusted with 480 Ashoka-cut diamonds, totaling over 100 carats. Brady himself wore a Jacob & Co. Caviar Tourbillon timepiece in Yellow Sapphires that retailed for $740K at the time.On watching the massive diamond watch being gifted to Brady’s son, a user speculated, “Boy needs some motivation to be great.”Brady’s 16-year-old son, Benjamin, is currently involved in multiple sports, including football and basketball.In a September 2023 episode of Let’s Go! With Tom Brady, Larry Fitzgerald, and Jim Gray, the NFL legend shared that his son wanted to become a tight end like Rob Gronkowski. “So, I actually texted Gronk,” Brady said, “And I’m like, ‘Yo, my boy wants to be like you!’ And he loved it.”Cut to the present: on Benjamin’s 16th birthday, December 8, 2025, Brady shared a heartfelt post on Instagram. The seven-time Super Bowl champion wrote, “Happy 16th Birthday, my precious forever baby boy Benny! 🎉 You’re officially old enough to drive, but not old enough to stop texting me “Where r u?” at midnight.😜 You are kind and caring and thoughtful, you lead with your heart but you are also so funny and fun to be around and you make every room brighter.Proud doesn’t cover it, mostly I’m shocked you grew up so fast and somehow still haven’t learned to fold a laundry basket properly 😅😅. Here’s to more big moments, great grades, sports wins, and a slightly lighter Uber bill. And I know this next year will be your best year yet. We love you sooooo much. 🍰🚗💨.”The resurfacing of the heavily diamond-studded watch online, interestingly, coincides with Benjamin’s 16th birthday.

Philadelphia Flyers suspend Tim Saunders after hot mic comment during Sabres game



Philadelphia Flyers radio announcer Tim Saunders has been suspended after an unexpected remark that accidentally got aired during Thursday night’s game against the Buffalo Sabres. The broadcaster, who had been with the Flyers since 1997, appeared to believe the broadcast had gone to commercial when a hot mic picked up a highly inappropriate comment that quickly received immense backlash.The incident took place in the third period when the Flyers broadcast on 97.5 The Fanatic continued recording while Saunders casually spoke off-air, totally unaware his mic was still live. Within seconds, analyst and former Flyer Todd Fedoruk warned him they were still on air, but the damage had already been done, which flipped into a serious broadcast controversy.On Friday morning, the Flyers addressed the situation publicly, announcing that Tim Saunders is suspended for the team’s next two radio broadcasts. The organization stressed that the comment was not representative of team values or broadcasting standards and that respect, professionalism, and accountability were expected of everyone representing the team through any form of media.Audio from the Flyers-Sabres game got Saunders handling the situation for listeners before the inappropriate remark was heard during what he clearly believed was an off-air break.Once the mistake became obvious, there was brief confusion in the booth before acknowledging the ongoing live feed. By then, the clip had already circulated, prompting swift reaction and a need for immediate accountability.Saunders released a statement acknowledging what he called an error in judgment, explaining that he thought the broadcast had cut to a commercial. He came up with an official apology to Flyers fans, listeners, and everyone affected, promising to hold himself to a higher professional standard and ensure the radio environment remains respectful forward.Moments like this reveal how quickly things can spiral in today’s sports media world, where nothing stays private for long, especially on social media platforms. For now, the Philadelphia Flyers will go forward without their longtime radio voice for two games, while everyone is eager to see how the officials and Tim Saunders handle this controversy that spread out in a very public way.","Philadelphia Flyers suspend Tim Saunders after hot mic comment during Sabres game.

EU-Mercosur trade deal: Lula eyes January signing; EU farmer protests and member pushback delay pact,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-mercosur-trade-deal-lula-eyes-january-signing-eu-farmer-protests-and-member-pushback-delay-pact/articleshow/126096259.cms,"Photo- AP

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said on Saturday that he hopes the long-pending free-trade agreement between Mercosur and the European Union will be signed in January, even as opposition from some EU members and protests by European farmers delay the deal, AP reported.Speaking at a summit of South American leaders in Foz do Iguacu, on Brazil’s border with Argentina and Paraguay, Lula said European negotiators had earlier indicated the agreement would be signed this weekend, prompting the meeting. That did not happen, he said, after Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni asked for more time.Top EU officials had been aiming to finalise the EU-Mercosur deal in Brazil, but European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday, following a tense EU summit, that the signing would be postponed by “a few extra weeks” to address concerns raised by member states.Lula said he spoke to Meloni by phone on Friday and received a letter from EU leadership indicating an intention to conclude the agreement in January. He added that the delay underscored the lack of political resolve to finish talks that have stretched over more than 26 years.“Without political will and courage from leaders, it won’t be possible to finish a negotiation that has dragged for 26 years,” Lula told fellow leaders.“Meanwhile, Mercosur will continue to work with other partners.”Von der Leyen needs the backing of at least two-thirds of EU member states to secure the deal. Italy’s opposition would allow France to marshal enough votes to block her from signing it.“The world is eager to make deals with Mercosur,” Lula said. “Many countries want that. And we certainly will be able to finish the deals that were not finished during my presidency [of the bloc, which ends in December].”If concluded, the agreement would create a market of about 780 million people, covering roughly a quarter of global gross domestic product, and would gradually remove duties on most goods traded between the two blocs.France has led resistance to the pact involving the EU and the five active Mercosur members — Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia. French President Emmanuel Macron said at the EU summit on Thursday that he would not commit to supporting the deal next month and was in talks with Italian, Polish, Belgian, Austrian and Irish leaders about delaying it to address farmers’ concerns.Lula said Macron alone could not block the agreement.“Let’s hope that things happen for the good of our Mercosur, multilateralism and the development of our countries,” he said.","Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said he hopes the long-pending free-trade agreement between Mercosur and the European Union will be signed in January.

The global economy has entered a phase where artificial intelligence has become the dominant force shaping growth, markets and policy, with the US now the most exposed to both its promise and its risks, according to economist and investor Ruchir Sharma.“This big factor has out-Trumped Trump – AI,” Sharma said in a conversation with Nicolai Tangen, earlier on December first week, arguing that artificial intelligence has now become “the singular focus of the global economy and particularly the US economy”.Ruchir Sharma, chairman of Rockefeller International and founder and chief investment officer of Breakout Capital, is a veteran global investor and economic commentator.“The US economy has now become one big bet on AI,” he said. “Outside of AI, there’s a lot of weakness in the US economy. But AI has continued to drive everything.”Sharma warned that the scale of this concentration leaves little margin for error. “This big bet on AI better works out for America,” he said. “Because if it doesn’t work out, then I think that there’s a lot of trouble for this country ahead.”Veteran analyst pointed to the growing contribution of AI-linked capital expenditure to US growth.“The measures currently show that about 40% of economic growth in America this year has come from capex spending towards AI,” he said.Beyond investment, he stressed the importance of the wealth effect. “The stock market doing well, the financial assets doing well — that is clearly powering the spending of the top 10% in this country,” Sharma said. “And the top 10% is what’s driving the entire consumer spending.”He added that market gains themselves are heavily concentrated. “About 80% of the gains in the stock market this year have been powered by AI plays,” he said.“By some measures, you can argue that about 60% of economic growth in America today is being driven by AI.”Despite the scale of investment, Sharma said it is still too early to see decisive productivity gains from AI. “AI adoption is still in its nascent stage,” he said. “So far, it’s too early.”Asked how much of recent productivity improvement can be attributed to AI, Sharma replied, “Very little as yet.”Drawing a comparison with the internet boom, he said, “If you look back at the internet revolution in the late 1990s, the big bump in productivity really happened later. It takes a while for these benefits to come through.”He also said there is still uncertainty about how AI will ultimately be used. “We don’t even know as yet what exactly AI is going to end up doing,” Sharma said.The author ofRuchir Sharma argued that AI differs from past technological revolutions because of widespread fear rather than optimism.“This is the most hated tech revolution,” he said. “If you look back at the other big revolutions, people were very optimistic about what it would bring.”By contrast, Sharma said surveys show deep anxiety. “Only about 35% of people are feeling good about AI,” he said. “Most people want this to be regulated because they’re fearful about the impact.”“One, all the techno-optimists are telling them, ‘We’re coming for your job.’ And second is just fear — people don’t know how to use these tools,” he added.While calling AI a “good bubble”, Sharma said the market displays multiple warning signs.“I look at the four O’s,” he said — “overinvestment, overvaluation, overownership and overleverage.” On investment, he said, “Tech investment as a share of GDP is about 5% today. That’s roughly what we saw back in 2000.”On valuations, Sharma said, “By any stretch, the US stock market — and of course the AI plays — are overvalued.” While price-to-earnings ratios may not match dotcom levels, he said, “If you look at price to free cash flow or very long-term earnings, by those measures we are getting there.”Overownership is also visible. “Americans have about 52% of their financial wealth in equities today,” Sharma said. “That is higher than what it was even in 2000.”On leverage, he said conditions are changing fast. “The biggest issuers of debt in the last few months have been companies like Meta, Amazon and even Microsoft,” Sharma said, as firms rush to stay ahead in the AI arms race.Sharma said bubbles rarely burst because of technology disappointment alone.“Every single bubble or mania in history has been pricked by just one factor — when interest rates finally go up,” he said.He expressed concern about the Federal Reserve’s policy stance. “Inflation is already quite sticky,” Sharma said. “The Fed’s 2% target is nowhere in sight. The Fed has missed its 2% target for five years in a row.”“The fact that the Fed is cutting interest rates in this environment is completely bewildering to me,” he added.If inflation accelerates or rates rise, Sharma warned, “That’s when this entire overinvestment AI bubble will burst.”Sharma said one of the biggest surprises this year has been the underperformance of US markets relative to Europe, emerging markets and China.“At the beginning of the year, everyone was onto the American exceptionalism trade,” he said. “Instead, Europe, emerging markets and China have outperformed America.”He said extreme positioning played a role. “America’s weight in global equity indices was hitting nearly 70%,” Sharma said.But reforms also mattered. “In Europe, expectations were very low, but at least countries like Germany began to wake up and say, ‘We need to do something here’,” he said.Sharma said China’s market rebound reflects necessity rather than ideology.“The economy in China is in big trouble outside of AI,” he said. “The property market is bust.”He said Beijing realised that competing with the US on AI required a shift. “There was a very important pivot,” Sharma said. “China realised that if we have to compete with America on AI, we need to back the private sector again.”“Jack Ma is back at Alibaba,” he noted, adding that the stock has doubled this year.Sharma said the expanding role of the state continues to distort capitalism.“The asymmetry remains,” he said. “On the upside, you capitalise the gains. On the downside, the risks are socialised.”On tariffs, he said, “There’s no objectivity or science behind it. It’s very arbitrary.”While tariffs have helped revenues — cutting the US deficit by about 1% of GDP — Sharma said, “Tariffs have had a negative effect on economic growth. It’s just been offset by the optimism around AI.”Looking ahead, Sharma highlighted quality stocks as a neglected opportunity.“The last 12 months have been one of the worst runs that quality stocks have had in recorded history,” he said.“There has never been a better time to buy quality stocks,” Sharma added, referring to companies with high returns on equity, low leverage and strong cash flows.He also expects global markets to continue outperforming the US. “These tend to be multi-year trends once they begin,” he said.While he declined to predict exact timing, Sharma offered a clear signal to watch: “At the slightest sign that interest rates are going to go up — that’s when you know this is done.”","Ruchir Sharma, chairman of Rockefeller International and founder and chief investment officer of Breakout Capital, is a veteran global investor and economic commentator. “This big factor has out-Trumped Trump – AI,” Sharma said in a conversation with Nicolai Tangen, earlier on December first week.

Plaintiffs in the first lawsuit against the $100K entry-fee for H-1B workers approach court to seek urgent relief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/plaintiffs-in-the-first-lawsuit-against-the-100k-entry-fee-for-h-1b-workers-approach-court-to-seek-urgent-relief/articleshow/126090420.cms,".

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

A coalition of US healthcare providers, educational institutions and employers have moved to court seeking urgent relief from the Trump administration’s controversial $100,000 entry-fee for H-1B workers, which was announced on Sept 19, via a proclamation. They have sought an immediate block on its enforcement and nationwide protection for affected employers.In two new filings before the US District Court for the Northern District of California, the plaintiffs have sought a preliminary injunction to pause the fee while the case is heard, and certification of a nationwide class to ensure that any relief granted applies uniformly across the country. The filings argue that the six-figure entry-fee imposed through a presidential proclamation is unlawful, arbitrary and beyond the executive’s authority, and is already disrupting medical care, education and local economies.The legal challenge follows an earlier lawsuit filed by these plaintiffs on Oct 3 (duly reported by TOI), which questioned the Trump administration’s decision to bypass Congress and impose an unprecedented and unauthorised cost on the H-1B visa programme.Soon after this coalition led by Global Nurse Force filed the lawsuit (it was the first to challenge the entry fee), the Trump administration issued a new guidance seemingly backtracking on one of the proclamations' most extreme provisions.It now stated that the fee may not apply to certain individuals already in the US who are in the process of changing their immigration status. For instance, the fee would not apply in case of an F-1 student who has transitioned to an H-1B visa ‘while’ in the US. However, the coalition points out that the fee remains in effect in many circumstances, harming students, workers, and employers in America.The new court filings seek to immediately halt enforcement of the fee, which applies to employers hiring doctors, nurses, teachers, engineers, researchers and other highly skilled professionals, regardless of their size or public-service role.The plaintiffs are represented by several advocacy groups, including Democracy Forward and the South Asian American Justice Collaborative (SAAJCO); and IMMpact litigation (a joint venture of four law firms).Kalpana V. Peddibhotla, executive director, SAAJCO, said: “South Asians comprise the majority of H-1B workers and are deeply woven into the US economy. By seeking class certification and a preliminary injunction, we seek to halt the proclamation’s imposition of an unlawful $100,000 H-1B fee and this attack on immigrant workers who make a difference to our day to day lives.” “If upheld, the Proclamation would establish a dangerous precedent by permitting the Executive Branch to impose sweeping financial barriers on lawful immigration programs without congressional authorization,” she added.The challenge mounted by healthcare providers and educational institutions is not the only one confronting the Trump administration’s $100,000 H-1B fee. The US Chamber of Commerce has also filed a separate lawsuit, arguing that the entry fee is unlawful, economically damaging and undermines the statutory H-1B framework enacted by Congress. In a further escalation, a coalition of 20 US states has more recently moved the courts, contending that the proclamation unlawfully shifts immigration policy by executive fiat and harms state economies, public services and employers reliant on skilled foreign workers. Together, the cases signal widening institutional resistance to the fee and raise the prospect of a broader judicial reckoning over the administration’s authority to impose sweeping immigration costs without legislative approval.","US healthcare providers, educational institutions and employers have moved to court seeking urgent relief from the Trump administration’s controversial $100,000 entry-fee for H-1B workers.

Skilled labour gap: Walmart steps up training to build in-house technicians; US companies widen push to fix trade shortages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/skilled-labour-gap-walmart-steps-up-training-to-build-in-house-technicians-us-companies-widen-push-to-fix-trade-shortages/articleshow/126092789.cms,"Photo credit - AP

As the pool of skilled tradespeople continues to shrink in the US, Walmart is moving to strengthen its in-house workforce to keep its vast operations running — from conveyor belts and refrigeration systems to electrical networks and basic infrastructure at stores and distribution centres, AP reported.The world’s largest retailer and biggest private employer has revamped its training programme over the past year to expand the pipeline of maintenance technicians, a category of jobs that has become increasingly difficult to fill amid a tightening labour market. These technicians handle tasks ranging from equipment repair to electrical and mechanical work across Walmart’s logistics hubs and retail outlets.The shortage has opened new career paths for workers such as Liz Cardenas, 24, who joined Walmart in May 2023 as an automation equipment operator at a distribution centre in Lancaster, Texas. Her initial role involved monitoring conveyor belts to ensure cartons moved smoothly. Today, she fixes conveyor systems and other machinery when they break down.Cardenas said her hourly pay has nearly doubled to $43.50, and she plans to undergo further training that could bring higher pay and responsibility.“I was able to move out of my parents’ house,” she said. “I have my own apartment. I was able to get a car, and I’m able to give more to my 401(k).”Analysts say labour shortages have been driven by a wave of retirements and a slowdown in immigration that began during the pandemic and has since intensified with President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation push. In skilled trades, the problem is sharper. A McKinsey analysis of 12 trade categories — including welders, carpenters and maintenance technicians — projected an imbalance of 20 job openings for every one net new worker between 2022 and 2032.McKinsey warned that high churn could cost companies more than $5.3 billion annually in hiring and training expenses alone. The shortages are unfolding even as some firms cut jobs amid higher costs from tariffs, shifts in consumer spending and rising investments in artificial intelligence.In response, the Business Roundtable — a lobbying group representing chief executives of about 150 major US companies — launched a new initiative in June to address shortages in skilled trades. Co-led by home improvement retailer Lowe’s, the effort involves outreach to elementary, middle and high schools to raise awareness about trade careers.“While technology continues to evolve, it cannot replace plumbers, electricians, construction workers, maintenance and repair pros, or other tradespeople,” said Lowe’s chairman and CEO Marvin Ellison.Lowe’s began a 90-day online training programme in 2022 for employees interested in trades such as carpentry and utility maintenance. Its charitable arm has also invested $43 million since 2023 in 60 organisations, including technical colleges and non-profits, to recruit and train skilled workers.Mervin Jebaraj of the University of Arkansas’s Walton College of Business said such programmes may ease shortages but will not close the gap, especially given tighter immigration. “For as long as somebody physically needs to fix this, the shortage will persist,” he said. “We don’t have enough people.”Walmart chief executive Doug McMillon told AP that lack of awareness was a major factor. “Most Americans probably don’t know what a tech makes that helps take care of our stores and clubs,” he said.Walmart overhauled its tuition-free training initiative in spring 2024, initially in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and later expanded it to Vincennes, Indiana, and Jacksonville, Florida. The programme blends classroom learning with hands-on instruction in HVAC, electrical work and general maintenance.Nearly 400 employees had graduated as of mid-November, Walmart said. All 108 associates from the pilot batch secured technician roles, with average pay around $32 an hour. The company aims to train 4,000 workers by 2030.R.J. Zanes, vice-president of facility services for Walmart and Sam’s Club in the US, said maintenance roles are especially critical during the holiday season. A refrigeration failure at a single store can lead to losses of $300,000 to $400,000 in spoiled goods, he said.“We have to ensure that we’ve got the right skills there to do preventative maintenance,” Zanes said, “and when we do have a breakdown, get it back up as fast as possible to minimise downtime.”",The world’s largest retailer has revamped its training programme over the past year to expand the pipeline of maintenance technicians.

‘My job was not to command & control’: Long-time CEO reveals leadership lessons that changed his career,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/my-job-was-not-to-command-control-longtime-ceo-reveals-leadership-lessons-that-changed-his-career-key-takeaways/articleshow/126092089.cms,"File photo: Garry Ridge

Garry Ridge had already spent two years as CEO when he realised his biggest challenge was not the business, but himself.In 1999, while leading WD-40, Ridge enrolled in a master’s programme in executive leadership at the University of San Diego, believing he needed to change to help the company grow, as per CNBC.At the time, Ridge thought strong leadership meant being firm and directive. He described himself as a “be brief, be bright, be gone” leader who believed in command and control.But his time in business school, guided by professor Ken Blanchard, shifted that mindset. Ridge learned that his role was not to control people, but to support and empower them.Instead of running WD-40 with authority alone, he began focusing on belonging, trust and shared purpose. “My job was not to command and control,” Ridge said, adding that he could not grow the company on his own.This change proved critical as WD-40 expanded into 176 countries during his tenure.Ridge shared these reflections during an episode of Simon Sinek’s podcast “A Bit of Optimism”, where he spoke about how his leadership thinking evolved over time.Ridge said creating a safe environment was key, where employees felt confident enough to make decisions and take risks.“I had to make sure [people were] in an environment where they felt safe enough to make decisions and be brave,” he explained during the same podcast conversation.Now a leadership coach based in California, Ridge says many CEOs still struggle with the same toxic habits he once had. He warned against copying leaders with big egos, little empathy and a need to micromanage, calling it a flawed model, as per CNBC.To practise what he calls “servant leadership”, Ridge made small but meaningful choices. He reminded himself to praise others, avoided special privileges like a private parking space, and chose not to sit in a much larger office than his staff.His core belief is simple: “The will of the people times the strategy equals the outcome.” Ridge said when leaders focus on people, purpose, values and learning, employees are far more motivated to deliver results.","Garry Ridge was CEO of WD-40 when he realised he needed to change.

IMF’s New Conditions Expose Pakistan’s Deep Economic Faultlines Amid $7 Billion Rescue Package

ISLAMABAD: The World Bank has approved $700 million in financing for Pakistan under a multi-year initiative aimed at supporting the country's macroeconomic stability and service delivery, media reports said on Saturday.According to the lender, funds will be released under the bank's Public Resources for Inclusive Development - Multiphase Programmatic Approach (PRID-MPA), which could provide up to $1.35 billion in total financing, the Dawn newspaper reported.Of this amount, $600 million will go for federal programmes and $100 million will support a provincial programme in Sindh.The approval follows a $47.9 million World Bank grant in August to improve primary education in Punjab.A separate statement issued by the lender quoted Bolormaa Amgaabazar, the World Bank's country director for Pakistan, as saying, ""Pakistan's path to inclusive, sustainable growth requires mobilising more domestic resources and ensuring they are used efficiently and transparently to deliver results for people.""She said that through the MPA, the bank was working with the federal and Sindh governments to ""deliver tangible impacts-more predictable funding for schools and clinics, fairer tax systems, and stronger data for decision-making- while safeguarding priority social and climate investments and strengthening public trust"".Tobias Akhtar Haque, World Bank lead country economist for Pakistan, said strengthening Pakistan's fiscal foundations was ""essential to restoring macroeconomic stability, delivering results and strengthening institutions"".""Through the PRID-MPA, we are launching a coherent nationwide approach to support reforms that expand fiscal space, bolster investments in human capital and climate resilience, and strengthen revenue administration, budget execution, and statistical systems,"" he said.""These reforms will ensure that resources reach the front line and deliver better outcomes for people across Pakistan with greater efficiency and accountability,"" he added.According to the statement, the federal component will focus on raising domestic revenues more fairly, improving budget planning and execution, and strengthening data systems for evidence-based decisions.The programme will directly support the increase of public resources for inclusive development, including more equitable and responsive financing for primary healthcare facilities and more funding for schools, it added.In November, an IMF-World Bank report, uploaded by the finance ministry, said the country's fragmented regulation, opaque budgeting and political capture are curbing investment and weakening revenue.","The World Bank has approved $700 million in financing for Pakistan.

IMF’s New Conditions Expose Pakistan’s Deep Economic Faultlines Amid $7 Billion Rescue Package

The World Bank has approved $700 million in fresh financing for Pakistan as part of a longer-term programme aimed at supporting macroeconomic stability and improving public service delivery.As per Reuters, the funding has been cleared under the Public Resources for Inclusive Development – Multiphase Programmatic Approach (PRID-MPA), a framework through which Pakistan could receive up to $1.35 billion over multiple phases.The lender said the latest approval represents a major tranche under this broader initiative.Out of the $700 million, $600 million will be directed towards federal-level programmes, while the remaining $100 million will support a provincial initiative in Sindh, Pakistan’s southern province.The focus of the financing is to strengthen public resources and improve the delivery of essential services at both national and provincial levels.The approval comes months after the World Bank extended a $47.9 million grant in August to support primary education reforms in Punjab, the country’s most populous province.Together, the funding decisions signal continued engagement by multilateral lenders with Pakistan as it works to stabilise its economy and manage long-standing structural challenges.However, concerns over governance and institutional weaknesses remain. An IMF–World Bank report uploaded by Pakistan’s finance ministry in November flagged serious issues, including fragmented regulation, opaque budgeting practices and political capture of public resources.According to the report, these factors continue to deter investment and weaken the country’s revenue base, limiting the effectiveness of economic reforms.The latest World Bank financing also comes at a time when Pakistan remains heavily dependent on external funding to support its economy. Public debt has continued to rise, driven by slower economic growth and sustained borrowing from multilateral institutions.Recent inflows from bodies such as the IMF and other lenders have helped shore up external reserves and support fiscal consolidation efforts, but debt pressures remain elevated.Despite these challenges, Pakistan’s economy has shown signs of gradual recovery following two years of volatility. Growth has picked up modestly, the current account has moved into surplus, and foreign exchange reserves have improved, helped by multilateral disbursements and higher remittance inflows.The World Bank’s phased financing approach allows it to retain leverage over future funding while continuing to support Pakistan’s economic stabilisation efforts. How effectively the new funds translate into lasting reforms and improved service delivery will likely determine the pace and scale of further disbursements under the $1.35 billion programme, as per Reuters.","The World Bank has approved $700 million in fresh financing for Pakistan.

Infosys stock shock! Why did ADRs jump nearly 40% in minutes on NYSE? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/infosys-stock-shock-why-did-adrs-jump-nearly-40-in-minutes-on-nyse-explained/articleshow/126091268.cms,"Representative image

Why did the rally raise eyebrows?

Was a

short squeeze

involved?

Did a technical glitch play a role?

Did the sector backdrop help?

US-listed shares of Infosys shot up as much as 40% within minutes of the market opening on Friday, briefly adding tens of billions of dollars to the Indian IT major’s market value.The sudden surge pushed the American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) to a 52-week high of $30 and forced the New York Stock Exchange to halt trading due to extreme volatility, according to ET.The sharp move took place during a low-liquidity holiday session and was not linked to any new announcement from the company.The speed and scale of the rise caught traders off guard because there was no obvious trigger.Analysts pointed out that such extreme swings are unusual for a large, widely tracked stock like Infosys.The trading halt itself highlighted how fragile markets can become when liquidity is thin and automated systems dominate activity.One of the main explanations doing the rounds was a possible short squeeze. This happens when investors betting against a stock are forced to buy it back quickly as prices rise, pushing the stock even higher.Traders quoted by Moneycontrol said a major lender may have recalled 45–50 million Infosys ADR shares that had been lent out.That number is far higher than the usual daily trading volume of about seven to eight million shares.In a thin market, such a recall could have forced short sellers to rush for shares, accelerating the spike.Another theory is centred on a data error. According to The Chronicle Journal, several market data platforms mislabelled the Infosys ticker ‘INFY’ as ‘American Noble Gas Inc’.While the company name was wrong, the financial data and news attached to the ticker still referred to Infosys, including details about its AI investments and $75 billion market value.This mismatch may have confused algorithmic trading systems, triggering automated buying and adding fuel to the rally.Indian IT stocks had received some support after Accenture posted better-than-expected results. However, analysts said this alone could not explain such a dramatic move in Infosys ADRs, as per ET.Infosys clarified that there was no material reason behind the volatility. In an exchange filing, the company said the ADRs saw sharp price movements on December 19, triggering two volatility trading pauses on the NYSE, but added that there were “no material events that require disclosure” under listing regulations.Whether driven by short covering, a technical glitch or both, the episode underlines how quickly markets can spiral when low liquidity, automated trading and data errors collide — even for blue-chip stocks.",US-listed shares of Infosys shot up as much as 40% within minutes of the market opening on Friday.

"US monetary policy: Fed’s official sees no urgency for further rate cuts, flags distorted inflation data",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-monetary-policy-feds-official-sees-no-urgency-for-further-rate-cuts-flags-distorted-inflation-data/articleshow/126080651.cms,"A senior US Federal Reserve official has said there is no immediate need to cut interest rates further, cautioning that recent inflation data may have been distorted due to disruptions in data collection during the federal government shutdown, AFP reported.Speaking to CNBC on Friday, New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said inflation readings for recent months were likely affected because government agencies were unable to collect price data in October and the first half of November amid the record-long shutdown.“Because of that, I think the data were distorted in some of the categories, and that pushed down the consumer price index reading probably by a tenth or so,” Williams said, adding that it was difficult to precisely quantify the impact.He said inflation data for December could provide a clearer picture of the extent of the distortion.Williams’ remarks followed the release of a delayed US consumer price index report earlier this week, which showed inflation easing to 2.7 per cent in November from 3 per cent in September. Several economists had warned that the figures may not fully reflect underlying price pressures.Some analysts pointed out that a higher share of price quotes may have been collected during the Black Friday discount period, potentially biasing the data downward — a concern Williams echoed.Asked how the latest data influenced his outlook on interest rates, Williams said the Fed’s policy stance was appropriate for now.“I don’t personally have a sense of urgency to need to act further on monetary policy right now,” he said, adding that the rate cuts already delivered had positioned policymakers well.The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times this year as the labour market weakened, but has signalled a higher threshold for additional easing.

However, sales were down 1 per cent from November 2024, marking the first year-on-year decline since May. The figure was marginally below economists’ expectations of 4.14 million units, according to FactSet.The national median home price rose 1.2 per cent from a year earlier to $409,200. This marked the 29th consecutive month of annual price increases, even as overall housing activity remained subdued.The US housing market has been in a prolonged slowdown since 2022, when mortgage rates began rising sharply from pandemic-era lows. Although long-term mortgage rates have hovered near their lowest levels for the year. Affordability pressures remain high due to elevated prices and borrowing costs.Sales volumes have largely stagnated at around a 4-million-unit annual pace since 2023, well below the historical average of about 5.2 million units.","Existing home sales increased 0.5 per cent from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.13 million units.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

New excise duty on tobacco products: Cigarette prices to increase up to Rs 55 per pack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-excise-duty-on-tobacco-products-cigarette-prices-to-increase-up-to-rs-55-per-pack/articleshow/127842714.cms,"Growth Momentum Will Continue Says FM Sitharaman As Budget 2026 Bets On Tech Cities And Reforms

After the new excise duty regime kicked in, cigarette prices have gone up, with a pack of 10 sticks now costing at least Rs 22–25 more than before.This follows the government’s decision to raise taxes on cigarettes for the first time in nearly seven years, bringing India’s tobacco taxation closer to global public health norms. The new levies, approved by Parliament in December, will replace the existing GST compensation cess framework that has been in place since the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017.The increase in cigarette prices will vary depending on the length and type of cigarette.According to distributors, premium cigarettes of 76 mm length will now cost Rs 50–55 more per pack of 10 sticks, depending on the brand.While manufacturers are yet to issue revised MRP declarations, distributors have begun billing old stock to retailers with 40% GST.With wholesale markets shut on Sunday, distributors expect fresh stock with new MRPs to be lifted from Monday onwards.According to news agency PTI, a packet of Wills Navy Cut (76 mm), earlier priced at Rs 95 per pack of 10 sticks, is expected to cost around Rs 120 per pack.Cigarettes of 84 mm length—such as Gold Flake Kings and Lights, Wills Classic and Wills Classic Milds—currently priced at Rs 170 per pack of 10 sticks, are expected to cost between Rs 220 and Rs 225 per pack.Similarly, slim cigarettes such as Classic Connect (97 mm), priced at Rs 300 for a pack of 20 sticks, are expected to have an MRP of around Rs 350, the report said.However, distributors fear that the price hikes could lead to increased smuggling and the spread of counterfeit products. According to the All India Cigarette and Tobacco Distributors Federation (AICPDF), there are around 8,000–9,000 stockists of cigarettes and tobacco products across the country.“Some companies have already put their stocks on hold. They will start releasing them after billing under the new tax structure,” a stockist told PTI.“Tobacco products are among the few categories where small shopkeepers are still relevant. If this too is pushed into the hands of illicit networks, what will be left for honest retailers? This is not just about taxation—it is about survival,” he said.From February 2026, cigarettes and tobacco products will attract additional excise duty and cess over and above the highest 40% GST slab, replacing the current structure of 28% GST plus compensation cess.The Central Excise Act has also been amended to impose a per-stick excise duty on cigarettes, with rates varying according to length.",A pack of 10 sticks now costs at least Rs 22–25 more than before.

Trump Announces India-US Trade Deal, Reduces Reciprocal Tariffs On Delhi To 18%; PM Modi Reacts

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmarks, openedin red on Wednesday, a day after a strongly rally on the back of India-US trade deal announcement. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,671.95, down 56 points or 0.22%. BSE Sensex was at 83,472.11, down 267 points or 0.32%.Indian equity markets posted one of their strongest single-day rallies on Tuesday after India and the United States unveiled a long-awaited trade agreement, easing tariff-related worries that had pressured domestic stocks since April 25. The sharp rebound was driven by renewed investor confidence following clarity on trade, with analysts projecting that the positive momentum could continue in the near term.Market experts said sentiment is likely to remain constructive, supported by a combination of recent trade developments with the US and the European Union, announcements made in the Union Budget, and stock-specific triggers emerging from the ongoing third-quarter earnings season.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, ""The rally fuelled by the US-India trade deal will face hurdles to sustain.The IT selloff in the US yesterday will drag the Indian IT index,too, constraining the rally in the Indian market. Since valuations continue to be high there is no fundamental support for a sustained rally. A trigger from monetary policy scheduled on 6th Feb is unlikely since the MPC is expected to retain the rates and stance with a dovish tone. The economy is now in a state where a monetary stimulus is not required. So, it is likely that the MPC will wait to see the monetary transmission play out. The auto numbers on January suggest that the buoyant demand continues.”“Yesterday’s 639 point rally in the market was mainly driven by FII short covering and their buying of Rs 5236 crores in the cash market. Given the valuations, this bullish trend is likely to run out of steam. Investors should stick to fairly valued largecaps. The sectors that are expected to gain from exports to the US, like textiles and apparels, gems and jewellery and marine processing will witness some more price action. ""Foreign portfolio investors returned as strong buyers, purchasing equities worth Rs 5,236.28 crore during the session, exchange data showed. Domestic institutional investors also provided support, with net purchases of Rs 1,014 crore.Global cues, however, were mixed. Wall Street ended sharply lower on Tuesday as fears that artificial intelligence could intensify competition in the software space unsettled investors. Caution ahead of quarterly results from Alphabet and Amazon, due later this week, further weighed on sentiment in US markets.","Nifty50 and BSE Sensex openedin red on Wednesday, a day after a strongly rally on the back of India-US trade deal announcement.

Gold price prediction

today:

Gold prices may continue to be under pressure in the near term and high volatility is expected in silver prices, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Here’s his outlook on gold prices:

Performance:

Precious metals surged to fresh record highs on January 29 only to tumble hard the next day in the wake of the US President Trump unexpectedly nominating Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair. Warsh, the most hawkish among the leading contenders, advocates smaller balance sheet and is an inflation hawk, which stoked fear of a tighter monetary policy among traders.

The US Dollar, aided by the announcement and the supporting US data including hotter-than-expected PPI and encouraging Chicago PMI, strengthened, which further weighed on the precious metals and other commodities. In addition, in yet another negative factor, the CME Group raised margin requirements for precious metals and PGM group, which will come into effect after Monday's close.

Geopolitical concerns over Iran remain contained as the US weighs all its options that include diplomatic talks.

Stretched positioning, deleveraging, profit booking and tactical selling weighed heavily on precious metals.

It is to be noted that gold and silver had surged 30% and 70% YTD as on January 29.

Spot gold closed with a weekly loss of 1.87% at $4894 on January 30 as it tumbled nearly 10% that day; however, the total decline as measured from the record high of $5595 reached on January 29 to low of $4402 on February 2 amounts to a steep loss of $1193, or over 21%. Nonetheless, the shiny metal is still up around 12% YTD, which shows the extent of price rise in January.

Spot gold at the time of writing this article was trading at $4703, down 3.90% for the day.

Data roundup:

Data released on Monday showed that S&P US global manufacturing PMI at 52.40 topped the estimate of 52 in its January final reading. Similarly, ISM manufacturing PMI (January) coming at 52.60 Vs the estimate of 48.50 market the first month of expansion in manufacturing sector in 12 months and surged to the highest since August 2022.

China's RatingDog manufacturing PMI came in at 50.30 in January that topped the estimate of 50.

Eurozone's manufacturing PMI at 49.50 was above the median estimate of 49.40 but the manufacturing contracted for the third straight month.

Dollar Index and yields:

Moribund US Dollar Index, which fell to 95.55, a four-year low on January 27, closed at 96.99 on January 30, down 0.6% for the week. The Index, at the time of writing this article, was hovering around 97.54, up 0.by nearly .55% for the day.

2-year US yields, despite the nomination of Warsh, were down by 2 bps to 3.52% on Friday and finished the week nearly 2% lower, while ten-year yields were up by 1 bps to 4.235 and were steady in the week. At the time of writing, 2-year yields were up by 1% to 3.56%, while ten-year yields at 4.27% were up around 0.60% for the day.

Gold ETF and COMEX Inventory:

As of January 30, total known global gold ETF inventories stood at 100.54 MOz, up nearly 2% YTD.

Registered COMEX gold inventory at 19.04 MOz reached the highest level since December 15 but are down nearly 25% since the record peak of 24.25 MOz seen in April 2025.

Eligible COMEX gold stock at 16.71 MOz are down over 25% from the record level of 22.45 MOz reached in April and is at the lowest level since December 19.

US launches $12 billion minerals stockpiles:

The US President Trump, in his bid to counter China, will launch a strategic critical minerals stockpile with $12 billion in a venture termed as Project Vault in seed money. The project will focus on minerals such as gallium, cobalt, and rare earths.

Chinese media calls for strong Yuan:

China needs to strengthen the Yuan so that it can be widely used in international trade, investment and foreign exchange markets and reach the status of a global reserve currency, according to an article published on January 31 by Qiushi Journal, the official theoretical journal, and the news magazine.

CFTC data:

Hedge fund managers slashed their net bullish gold bets to 8-week low to 121,421 lots in the week ending January 27. The most bullish position since 2020 has been 285K lots noted in the week ending February 25.

Gold Price Outlook:

Barring flaring geopolitical tensions, gold is likely to be under pressure in the near term, though underlying fundamentals remain strong.

Upcoming US ISM services data and nonfarm payroll data are expected to cap the upside in the metal.

The yellow metal is expected to be highly volatile. It may decline to $4390/$4290. The upside is expected to be capped around $5000.

As India-US trade deal has been struck, appreciating INR will further pressurize the commodities in domestic markets and exchanges.

Silver Price outlook:

The white metal, also called the devil metal due to its inherent volatility, fell 41% from its record high of $121.65 on January 29 to $71.40 on February 2. At the time of writing, the metal was trading at $78.68, down nearly 7% for the day, but still up 10% YTD.

Unlike gold, silver ETFs, now at 823 MOz have seen a drawdown of nearly 5% YTD.

Silver, being a much smaller counter and lacking the benefit of central bank buying, is expected to be highly volatile.

Silver is expected to trade between $70 and $90. Interim resistance is at $85.

Traders can sell into rallies with a strict stoploss above $90. A breach of the crucial support at $70 will open the door to a test of $65 support.

'Dairy, Agriculture Protected': Piyush Goyal Outlines 'Historic' US-India Trade Deal, Lauds PM Modi

Textiles, Leather, Gems & Jewellery Among Sectors Set To Benefit

India expected to hike imports of oil, high-tech goods from US

NEW DELHI: A day after announcements by PM Modi and US President Donald Trump that the two sides had reached a trade agreement, the govt asserted that sensitive sectors such as agriculture and dairy have been protected and labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather, marine products and gems & jewellery stand to benefit from the deal, which is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.“We all know how PM Modi is worried about the interests of our farmers, those in animal husbandry and dairy, and has always secured their interest. He has never allowed their interests to be compromised… even in the US trade deal, India’s sensitive sectors, agriculture and dairy, have been protected,” commerce minister Piyush Goyal said.As a result, cereals, maize, soybean and genetically modified food may be kept out of the bilateral trade agreement, which has been in the works since last Feb.Goyal said that Modi had managed to secure a very good deal for India, which was better than what US had offered to some other competing countries. Indian and American officials are currently engaged in drafting a joint statement which is expected to be finalised in the next few days.Late Monday, Trump and Modi had announced that a deal had been finalised and tariffs on Indian imports will be slashed from 50% to 18%. Trump had gone on to claim that India will import oil, coal, technology and farm products to the tune of $500 billion from the US.The numbers came as a surprise given that in 2024-25, India’s overall goods imports added up to $721 billion.People familiar with the discussions said that goods imports from the US are projected at $100 billion annually over the next five years, compared with $46 billion last year. Some tariff concessions to the US will be phased over a period of time, with some items likely to be allowed through import quotas, as is the case under the recent FTAs with the EU, New Zealand and the UK.India had come under pressure from Trump administration to open up its dairy and agriculture sectors by reducing duty. Modi govt didn’t agree, and Goyal’s statement suggests India managed to persuade the US negotiators not to let this become an obstacle.Going forward, India is expected to step up imports of oil, LNG, high-value chips, equipment for data centres, aircraft and its components and nuclear equipment, some of which were allowed to be imported duty free in Budget. Given India’s demand for coking coal, chips and aircraft, some of the imports are already taking place, with some substitution likely.In return, lower duty access to US for Indian goods will help labour-intensive sectors and MSMEs, which had been impacted by steep tariffs imposed by Trump last Aug.“So, actually our exports will pick up now, that is my expectation... along with having found new markets where they will continue to be sold,” FM Nirmala said.","The govt asserted that sensitive sectors such as agriculture and dairy have been protected.

NEW DELHI: The focus has been on shrimps and textiles, but Indian carpets and rugs have seen a bruising year with exports slipping nearly 9% to $735 million between April and Nov. Lowering of tariffs is expected to come as a boost for the highly-labour intensive sector.While overall exports are down 4% to $1.3 billion during the first eight months of the fiscal year, the sheer weight of the American market has been enough to upset the cart for Indian players.Exports to the UK and UAE are up, but all the other markets add up to less than what is shipped to the US by Indian companies concentrated in centres around Varanasi and in Jammu & Kashmir.Over the last few months, India’s exports to the US had fallen 32% in Sept, followed by a 22% decline in Oct and 9% drop in Nov, commerce department data showed.When it comes to carpets and floor coverings, China is the world’s largest player, according to data on the World Integrated Trade Solutions website. But India’s main competitor is Türkiye that had enjoyed a tariff advantage over the last few months when the US slapped a hefty 50% tariff.","Indian carpets and rugs exports slip nearly 9% to $735 million between April and Nov.

India-US Trade Deal: US Tariff Cut Puts India Ahead Of China, Pakistan, Bangladesh In Trade Race

'Timing good'

Gems & jewellery, leather exporters await fineprint

It's advantage Indian exporter

A large garment exporter, who was at a party on Monday when Trump announced the removal of 50% tariffs, celebrated the news before getting on to calls with American buyers. Suddenly, the business dynamics looked different.From looking to relocate a part of ops to Sri Lanka, Kenya or Indonesia on the suggestion of US buyers, by morning, the exporter asked his office to pull out the list of all goods in transit. With tariffs set to be cut to 18%, the $1.50 discount being offered on garments won’t apply to shipments reaching US ports post-deal. “There’ll either be a fresh invoice, or an upcharge. We were taking a hit of around Rs 50 crore by selling at a discount,” said the exporter.Most exporters spent early Tuesday with buyers discussing the way forward, especially with garment orders for the next season being finalised.“We are in talks with our buyers and they are very happy. The timing of the announcement has been very good as orders for the next season were being finalised. The future is looking very bright, and we need to build scale, focus on expansion and skilling to take advantage of it,” said Sudhir Sekhri of Trendsetters, an exporter of womenswear.But the leather goods suppliers have missed the bus for the next season. “We will have to wait now. We had given up hope on the deal, but things are looking up now. American business is American business. No one can match it. The orders are large, it has its own charm,” said Farida Group chairman M Rafeeque Ahmed, whose company is a supplier to leading global brands. But all is not lost for him since he has shifted some of the orders to his factory in other countries, which is smaller.“The tariff cut lowers costs for US importers, provides immense relief to diamond jewellery manufacturers enhancing the competitiveness of Indian diamond jewellery in the largest export market. This is poised to revive demand and stabilise operations,” said GJEPC chairman Kirit Bhansali, while pitching for zero-duty access for Indian diamonds.Gems & jewellery exporters are waiting for the fineprint of the deal to emerge. “The sentiment is positive because we will be more competitive than some of the competing countries. Our buyers have inventory and we will be back in business once the details are out,” said Kama Jewelry MD Colin Shah.“We have waited for six months, the impact will last for another month or two at best,” said Ramesh Kumar Juneja, who leads the Council for Leather Exporters.","Gems & jewellery exporters are waiting for the fineprint of the deal to emerge.

Impact of 50% tariffs

Deal a relief

Post-deal push

Garments are one of the sectors hit the hardest by US tariffs. Pearl Global MD Pallab Banerjee tells TOI the trade deal with the US will immediately help Indian garment exporters bring orders back to India.It was a big setback as tariffs for cotton garments shot up from an average of 15% (MFN rate) to an average 65%. Stopping large factories was not an easy option, so many exporters continued to ship to the US by taking a price cut to compensate the tariff amount to their customers. Compared to Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam, India’s tariff was 30% higher. Exporters continued to offer discounts of 15-18% to mitigate the tariff difference from competing nations. Garments do not operate at such a margin, so we were in the red for these last seven months. Many exporters started shutting down factories after taking a hit for a few months. Overall impact would have been huge, given that India exported $5.5 billion of garments to US and every $1 billion exports mean 1.25 lakh direct jobs.Some exporters started looking at options of shifting their manufacturing in other countries and shutting down Indian factories.So this deal is a huge relief for the industry and the entire supply chain. Pearl Global has its own factories in India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Guatemala. About a quarter of our total business is made in India. We are trying to grow this share and this deal is a huge benefit for us as well. Over the last four years we reduced our dependence on the US market from around 85% to 52% and expanded footprints in Japan, EU, the UK and Australia markets for our top line sales.The deal will immediately add to our bottomlines here and it will impact our fourth quarter bottomlines positively. Going forward, we will not just bring back manufacturing to India but also grow it aggressively. Investment is going on in India and capacity is being increased here.","Garments are one of the sectors hit the hardest by US tariffs.

Impact of other deals

What next

Florence Shoe Company chairman Aqeel Panaruna tells TOI that the US trade deal is a turning point and is moving ahead with plans for a JV with a foreign player.Earlier, Indian exports to the US were burdened with very high tariffs, up to 50% in certain product categories, which severely impacted competitiveness, volumes and buyer confidence. Many US customers were hesitant to place long-term orders, despite India’s strong manufacturing capability.With this agreement, the expected tariff rationalisation will immediately improve cost competitiveness, enable Indian manufacturers to regain lost market share, and encourage US buyers to commit to longer-term sourcing partnerships. For us, this creates clear visibility for capacity expansion, new product lines and fresh investments, including our Rs 2,500-crore Taiwanese joint venture. Additional investments that were earlier on hold will now be actively reconsidered.The trade agreements with the EU, UK, EFTA, and now the US together create a well-balanced and resilient export ecosystem for Indian industry. Covid-19 disruptions and prolonged tariff uncertainty taught us an important lesson — over-dependence on a single market is risky. The clear takeaway is to balance trade through diversification.Our strategy is not dependence, but portfolio balance. Europe remains strong for value and design-led products, the UK offers continuity, EFTA opens premium markets and the US brings scale and innovation.A few structural challenges remain. First is cost competitiveness. Second is speed and scale of infrastructure. Addressing these will help India not only benefit from trade agreements but fully capitalise on them as a trusted global manufacturing hub, while supporting job growth.","Florence Shoe Company chairman Aqeel Panaruna tells TOI that the US trade deal is a turning point and is moving ahead with plans for a JV with a foreign player.

Post-deal strategy

Benefit of US deal

Seafood exporter Captain Fresh, which has a revenue of close to $800 million, has exposure of around 65% to the US market and has shifted most of the sourcing to Ecuador to tackle the impact of tariffs. Now, it is not just looking to bring that back to India but also have a much bigger footprint in Europe, including through a likely acquisition. The company’s founder and CEO Utham Gowda spoke to TOI.Pre-tariffs, we used to source two-thirds of our products from India, Indonesia and Vietnam, which we flipped to Ecuador post-tariffs. We sacrificed our margins significantly because we do not have access to manufacturing capacities in Ecuador. In India, the margin is double.It was pre-agreed with our Indian suppliers with excess production capacities that we will restart manufacturing in their facilities as early as possible. We already operate one of the largest distribution infrastructure in the US and Europe for an Indian seafood company. We continue to double down on distribution with acquisitions lined up in Europe and the US adding ~$500 million to our revenue.The US trade deal gives us an opportunity to double our EBIDTA margin, given the demand there and in Europe.For us, the impact of the US tariff cut is not about shipment volumes. It is about margin expansion, driven by backward integration in India. With tariff clarity, we can move processing and value-added manufacturing for our brands back to India and capture more value domestically, rather than offshore. This is not about cost competitiveness, as we can source globally. It is about where value is created. Over time, this integration has the potential to significantly expand margins.","Captain Fresh, which has a revenue of close to $800 million, has exposure of around 65% to the US market.

While the sector was insulated from punitive US tariffs, the generics business of major companies, including Sun Pharma , Dr Reddy’s and Cipla faced significant headwinds in the third quarter ended Dec 2025, amid intensifying competition and price erosion in that market.With the US accounting for nearly 35% of India’s overall pharma shipments of over $30 billion in FY24-25, the move is expected to bolster growth prospects and pipeline visibility. A potential India-US trade deal offers long-awaited stability for the domestic pharma sector, which plays a critical role in supplying affordable medicines to the US, industry experts told TOI.Kartik Jain, Partner, JSA Advocates & Solicitors said: “The move strengthens India’s competitive position vis-à-vis other exporting jurisdictions facing higher tariff barriers. From a legal and commercial perspective, until the detailed text and implementation framework are released, Indian companies will need to carefully assess how these commitments translate into actual commercial and regulatory benefits. ”“Pharma generics was hitherto left outside the tariffs. The FTA now provides clarity on that. This will help domestic generic companies with their US plans,’’ Sujay Shetty, global health industries advisory leader, PwC India said.“Equally, this strengthens India’s role in resilient supply chains with a predictable and positive moving tariff headline,’’ according to Ayush Mehrotra, Partner, Khaitan & Co. “Pharmaceuticals were kept outside the scope..Beyond tariffs, the sector’s long-term growth will continue to hinge on regulatory compliance, timely FDA approvals, and resilient supply chains,” Manoj Mishra, partner and Tax Controversy Management Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat noted.Analysts said reduction in tariffs will make Indian exports more competitive in the US.","The US accounts for nearly 35% of India’s overall pharma shipments of over $30 billion in FY24-25.

India-US Trade Deal: Ex-US Trade Rep Mark Linscott Hails Pact Linking World’s Top Economies

The ambition Is Set (February 13, 2025)

Negotiations begin — then stall (March–April 2025)

Formal talks progress (April–June 2025)

Deadline pressure (June 2025)

Tariff escalation (July–August 2025)

Backchannel push to salvage talks (September–December 2025)

The Deal is sealed (February 2026)

US President Donald Trump on Monday announced a trade deal with India, months after Washington imposed steep tariffs of up to 50 per cent on Indian goods, including penalties linked to New Delhi’s purchase of Russian crude.Announcing the agreement on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said the US would cut reciprocal tariffs on Indian exports to 18 per cent from 25 per cent and claimed that India had agreed to lower tariffs on US goods and halt Russian oil imports. Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledged the tariff reduction, calling it a boost for “Made in India” products, but New Delhi has not commented on the oil-related claims made by the US president.The deal was announced after months of negotiations. Here's a look at the key moments that led to deal announcement on February 2Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump agreed to deepen bilateral trade ties, setting a target of more than doubling trade to $500 billion by 2030. The two sides announced plans to negotiate the first tranche of a multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement by fall 2025.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal made multiple visits to Washington, engaging with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. But on April 2, Trump imposed a 26 per cent import duty on Indian goods, jolting talks. Though the tariff was suspended for 90 days on April 9, uncertainty lingered.India’s chief negotiator Rajesh Agrawal led delegations to Washington, while a US team headed by Additional USTR Brendan Lynch visited India. Negotiators agreed on the framework of talks spanning 19 chapters, including tariffs, market access, digital trade, and regulatory barriers.With the July 9 tariff deadline approaching, India sent another delegation to Washington to bridge differences. Days later, Trump publicly said the US was headed towards a “very big” trade deal with India, signalling political intent even as differences remained.On July 31, the US announced a 25 per cent duty on Indian goods, followed days later by an additional 25 per cent penalty tariff linked to India’s continued purchase of Russian oil. Tariffs on most Indian exports rose to 50 per cent, sharply raising the stakes.After months of escalation, negotiators returned to the table. USTR officials visited India in September, followed by high-level engagements in New York and Washington. By December, six formal rounds of talks had been completed, with Deputy USTR Rick Switzer leading a delegation to New Delhi.In January, both sides signalled momentum, with Goyal saying India was working to close the “father of all deals.” On February 2, Trump announced that Washington would reduce the reciprocal tariff on Indian goods to 18 per cent following a phone call with Modi, sealing the agreement.","US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with India on Monday.

NEW DELHI: US -listed shares of major Indian companies surged after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal cutting US tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, in return for India agreeing to halt purchases of Russian oil and lower trade barriers.On Wall Street, IT services major Infosys closed 4.3% higher, Wipro jumped 6.8%, HDFC Bank gained 4.4%, and the iShares MSCI India exchange-traded fund rose 3%, reflecting investor optimism around improved trade access and reduced tariff pressure.Trump announced the agreement on Monday following a call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying India would now buy oil from the United States and potentially Venezuela. A White House official told Reuters that the US would rescind a punitive 25% duty imposed on all imports from India over its purchases of Russian oil, which had been stacked on top of a 25% “reciprocal” tariff.PM Modi welcomed the move, saying, “Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%. Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement.”Trump said India had committed to “BUY AMERICAN at a much higher level,” including more than $500 billion worth of US energy, technology, agricultural and other products. “They will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO,” Trump said.Despite the market reaction, details of the deal remain limited. Trump’s social media post did not specify when the lower tariff rates would take effect, the timeline for India to end Russian oil purchases, or the scope of trade barrier reductions. As of late Monday, the White House had not issued a presidential proclamation or Federal Register notice required to formalise the changes.India’s commerce and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Russia’s embassy in Washington also did not respond. Previous US trade deals with Japan and South Korea included large investment commitments, but no such pledges were mentioned in the India announcement.Economists said the agreement brings India broadly in line with Asian peers on tariff rates. Madhavi Arora of Emkay Global said it would remove a disproportionate drag on India’s exports and its rupee, after Indian markets were hit hard by the tariff hikes and saw record foreign investor outflows in 2025.US business groups reacted cautiously. The US Chamber of Commerce called the announcement progress toward a broader market-opening deal. “We are optimistic that this is the first step toward a comprehensive trade agreement that will unlock even more private sector collaboration,” its CEO Suzanne Clark said.The deal also comes amid efforts by the Trump administration to finalise trade frameworks before a US Supreme Court ruling on the legality of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs. India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, has recently begun reducing Russian oil purchases, with imports projected to fall sharply in the coming months, according to Reuters.","US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal cutting US tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%.

US plans $12 billion stockpile to cut China dependence; rare earth security becomes strategic priority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-plans-12-billion-stockpile-to-cut-china-dependence-rare-earth-security-becomes-strategic-priority/articleshow/127865741.cms,"The United States is preparing to launch a $12 billion critical minerals stockpile initiative aimed at reducing dependence on China for rare earths and other strategic resources, according to a White House official, as Washington intensifies efforts to secure supply chains for key industries, AFP reported.The project is expected to combine about $1.7 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), with funding directed towards securing and storing critical minerals for use by US industries including automotive, technology and defence sectors.The stockpile is designed to support private-sector demand by ensuring access to minerals vital for manufacturing products ranging from smartphones and electric vehicles to advanced military equipment.Rare-earth metals have gained strategic importance after China, a dominant global supplier, imposed export restrictions last year, heightening supply chain concerns across Western economies.China’s dominance across the rare earth value chain — spanning mining, processing and advanced materials innovation — is the result of sustained industrial policy over several decades, giving Beijing leverage in global trade negotiations.The proposed stockpile, expected to be announced by President Donald Trump, aims to gradually offset this advantage and stabilise access to critical materials for US manufacturers.According to reports, the initiative — dubbed “Project Vault” — could involve participation from more than a dozen companies, including automakers General Motors and Stellantis, aerospace major Boeing and technology firm Alphabet-owned Google.The programme is expected to cover rare earths, critical minerals and other strategic elements prone to supply disruptions and price volatility.The move comes amid renewed trade tensions between the United States and China following the reintroduction of tariffs after Trump returned to the presidency last year.The US and its allies are increasingly investing in alternative mining and processing supply chains to reduce strategic dependence on China, though industry experts caution that building fully diversified supply networks could take several years.The EXIM Bank is expected to vote on authorising the proposed 15-year loan for the project, which could become one of the largest financing deals of its kind, according to reports.","The project is expected to combine about $1.7 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of the United States.

Wall Street opened on a subdued note Monday as big technology stocks weighed on US indices, even as gold and silver prices clawed back part of their recent losses, according to AP.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, putting it on track for a fourth straight modest decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 173 points, while the Nasdaq Composite also dropped 0.2% in early trade. Nvidia and other large technology stocks pressured the market, as their chips remain central to global artificial intelligence expansion.The moves followed global volatility overnight. US futures had earlier weakened, with S&P 500 futures down 0.7%, Dow futures off 0.4%, and Nasdaq futures falling 0.7%, amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s nominee for the next Federal Reserve chair and renewed concerns about a potential AI market bubble.Precious metals recovered part of last week’s sharp losses. Gold rose 1.3% to about $4,800 per ounce, while silver jumped 5.9% to $83.19, though both remained below recent highs after Friday’s sharp correction.Bitcoin stabilised after a steep fall, rising about 1.5% to just above $78,000, though crypto-linked stocks remained under pressure. Coinbase fell 3.7% in early trade, while bitcoin holder Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, dropped 7.6%.Oil prices were sharply lower after tumbling more than 5% overnight.

Natural gas prices dropped 17% after recent weather-driven gains.Investors are also tracking a heavy week of corporate earnings and US labour market data, including the January jobs report due later in the week.Shares of Walt Disney Co edged up less than 1% after the company reported strong first-quarter results, supported by box-office performances of “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Disney Entertainment revenue rose 7%, while Experiences division revenue grew 6%.Markets are also assessing the potential policy stance of Kevin Warsh, Trump’s nominee for Federal Reserve chair, whose nomination requires Senate approval. Concerns that the Fed’s independence could be tested have helped support gold prices and weaken the US dollar over the past year.In global markets, Asian indices saw sharper declines earlier in the session.

US President Donald Trump has claimed that his sweeping tariff policies have created an “American economic miracle”, dismissing warnings of global fallout and asserting that critics of his trade strategy “were all wrong”.In an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal, Trump said the tariffs he imposed on nearly all foreign countries last April had strengthened the US economy rather than triggering the global economic meltdown predicted by skeptics.“When I imposed historic tariffs on nearly all foreign countries last April, the critics said my policies would cause a global economic meltdown,” Trump wrote, as quoted news agency ANI. “Instead, they have created an American economic miracle, and we are quickly building the greatest economy in the history of the world, with other countries doing just fine!”The US president said he inherited a “ravaged economy” from his predecessor and was accused of pushing the world towards recession, but claimed those forecasts had been disproved. “Nine months later, the results are in, every one of those predictions has proven completely and totally wrong,” he wrote, adding that since his election in 2024 the US had seen 52 stock market highs.Trump asserted that the American economy was growing at 4.4 per cent with inflation at 1.4 per cent, and that real incomes for US workers had risen by between $1,000 and $2,000. He also claimed the stock market had “skyrocketed” since what he described as “Liberation Day”, saying the Dow Jones Industrial Average could soon breach the 50,000 mark.In the op-ed, Trump further claimed his administration had cut the federal budget deficit by 27 per cent in a single year and slashed the monthly trade deficit by 77 per cent, “all with virtually no inflation”.He also cited trade agreements with China, the UK, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, saying these deals had blunted retaliation against the US and strengthened economic security.Trump went on to make broader claims about the geopolitical impact of tariffs, arguing that they had bolstered US national security and even contributed to peace-making efforts. He asserted—without evidence—that tariffs had helped resolve several conflicts, including what he described as mediation between India and Pakistan.Concluding his article, Trump urged critics to acknowledge his record. “Just over one year ago, we were a ‘DEAD’ country. Now, we are the ‘HOTTEST’ country anywhere in the world,” he wrote, adding that skeptics should don his “favourite red hats” bearing the slogan: “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!",US President Donald Trump has claimed that his sweeping tariff policies have created an “American economic miracle” He dismissed warnings of global fallout and asserted that critics of his trade strategy “were all wrong” Trump said the tariffs he imposed on nearly all foreign countries last April had strengthened the US economy rather than triggering global economic meltdown.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127824776,imgsize-747985,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

The US government entered a partial shutdown Saturday after Congress failed to approve the 2026 budget by midnight. The shutdown was triggered by Democratic opposition to federal immigration agents killing two protesters in Minneapolis, which halted talks about Department of Homeland Security funding. However, the disruption is expected to be brief as the House plans to approve a Senate-backed deal early next week.The Senate also passed a funding package Friday that covers many federal agencies through September. It also includes a temporary two-week extension for DHS operations while lawmakers work out immigration enforcement details. However, about 75% of federal operations are impacted by the shutdown, affecting various sectors like education, health, housing, and defense.Senate Democratic Minority Whip Dick Durbin criticised the administration's priorities, saying, ""Instead of going after drug smugglers, child predators, and human traffickers, the Trump Administration is wasting valuable resources targeting peaceful protestors in Chicago and Minneapolis."" He added, ""This Administration continues to make Americans less safe.""Federal departments started implementing shutdown procedures overnight.If the shutdown continues beyond a few days, many federal workers could face unpaid leave or work without pay until funding resumes. However, both Republican and Democratic leaders believe the disruption will be short-lived once the House approves the Senate's package.President Trump has endorsed the Senate's agreement and is pushing for quick House action. He aims to avoid a lengthy shutdown like the record-breaking hit last fall that disrupted federal services for over a month. The House, currently out of session until Monday, is expected to vote on the package when they return.While federal agencies began shutdown preparations, the impact on government services, contractors, and federal workers should be minimal if the House passes the funding package as anticipated early next week. This would restore funding within days, limiting the shutdown's practical effects.","The US government entered a partial shutdown Saturday after Congress failed to approve the 2026 budget by midnight.

He is a Partner of Stanley Druckenmiller at Duquesne Family Office LLC. Kevin received his A.B. from Stanford University, and J.D. from Harvard Law School. He has conducted extensive research in the field of Economics and Finance. Kevin issued an Independent Report to the Bank of England proposing reforms in the conduct of Monetary Policy in the United Kingdom. Parliament adopted the Report's recommendations. Kevin Warsh became the youngest Fed Governor, ever, at 35, and served as a Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2006 until 2011, as the Federal Reserve's Representative to the Group of Twenty (G-20), and as the Board's Emissary to the Emerging and Advanced Economies in Asia. In addition, he was Administrative Governor, managing and overseeing the Board's operations, personnel, and financial performance. Prior to his appointment to the Board, from 2002 until 2006, Kevin served as Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and Executive Secretary of the White House National Economic Council. Previously, Kevin was a member of the Mergers & Acquisitions Department at Morgan Stanley & Co., in New York, serving as Vice President and Executive Director. I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best. On top of everything else, he is “central casting,” and he will never let you down. Congratulations Kevin!""Warsh previously served as a member of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011 and was the youngest Fed governor at the time of his appointment. He worked closely with then Fed chair Ben Bernanke during the 2008 global financial crisis and emerged as a key link between policymakers and financial markets.Before joining the Fed, Warsh served in the White House as special assistant to the president for economic policy and executive secretary of the National Economic Council under president George W Bush. He began his career in investment banking at Morgan Stanley, where he worked in the mergers and acquisitions division.The nomination comes days after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady under current chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump again criticised, calling him a ""moron"". Trump had said he would announce his pick after the rate decision, as months of attacks on Powell have raised concerns among investors about political pressure on the central bank. US media reports said Warsh emerged ahead of other contenders, including Fed Governor Christopher Waller, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder and Trump’s economic adviser Kevin Hassett.In recent years, Warsh has criticised the Fed for moving into political territory and argued that its policy choices have constrained economic growth. He has publicly supported interest rate cuts to boost the economy, even as Fed officials have cautioned about inflation risks, including those stemming from Trump’s tariff policies.Warsh’s appointment will require confirmation by the US Senate. The Senate Banking Committee will first review the nomination, followed by a full Senate vote. Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican member of the committee, has said he will oppose any Fed nominee until an ongoing probe involving Powell is resolved.",US president Donald Trump on Friday announced Kevin Warsh as his nominee for chairman of the US Federal Reserve.

Musk meets Musk: SpaceX explores mergers with Tesla or xAI; $50 billion IPO in focus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/musk-meets-musk-spacex-explores-mergers-with-tesla-or-xai-50-billion-ipo-in-focus/articleshow/127795715.cms,"(AP)

Space-based data centers and AI strategy

SpaceX IPO could be largest in history

SpaceX is exploring potential mergers with Tesla Inc or artificial intelligence startup xAI, as Elon Musk considers ways to consolidate his growing business empire.The aerospace company has held internal talks about the feasibility of a SpaceX–Tesla merger, an idea that some investors are actively encouraging, reported Bloomberg, citing sources. Separately, SpaceX is also evaluating a possible combination with xAI ahead of a potential initial public offering.No final decisions have been made, and the details of any transaction could still change.Any merger involving SpaceX could draw strong interest from infrastructure funds and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, according to people familiar with the matter. One source noted that a deal could also require a significant financing component.Different merger structures could support Musk’s broader vision for SpaceX, including placing data centers in orbit to handle advanced artificial intelligence computing.A merger between SpaceX and xAI could allow the AI company to leverage space-based computing capacity, if the technical challenges can be overcome. SpaceX has discussed the possibility of using satellites and orbital infrastructure to support large-scale AI workloads.Tesla could also play a role in this strategy. The electric vehicle maker’s energy storage systems may help power space-based data centers using solar energy. Musk has additionally discussed using SpaceX’s Starship rockets to transport Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robots to the Moon and Mars.Following reports of the potential merger discussions, Tesla shares rose as much as 4.5% in after-hours trading on Thursday. The stock had declined 3.5% during regular trading, leaving Tesla with a market capitalization of approximately $1.56 trillion.Bloomberg News has previously reported that SpaceX is targeting an IPO valuation of around $1.5 trillion, potentially placing it among the most valuable companies in the world.According to Nevada business records, two legal entities containing the phrase “merger sub” were formed on January 21. Both entities list SpaceX Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen as an officer, a move often associated with merger preparations.Reuters previously reported on a potential SpaceX–xAI merger, under which xAI shares would be exchanged for SpaceX stock. Some xAI executives may be offered cash in lieu of equity, according to people familiar with the proposal.SpaceX is considering a public listing as early as June, around Elon Musk’s birthday, and could seek to raise up to $50 billion, sources have said. If completed, the offering would be the largest IPO in history.Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley are expected to serve as lead underwriters. Robinhood Markets is also seeking a role in the IPO, Bloomberg News reported.In December, CFO Bret Johnsen told employees that a SpaceX IPO would help fund an “insane flight rate” for the company’s Starship rocket and support plans for a permanent Moon base.","The aerospace company has held internal talks about the feasibility of a SpaceX–Tesla merger.

Asian stocks today: Markets open at low amid AI investment fears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-stocks-today-markets-open-at-low-amid-ai-investment-fears/articleshow/127790432.cms,"Representative AI image

Asian markets are mostly down on Friday as concerns about AI investments grow. Tech stocks took a hit, while gold and silver prices dropped from their record highs. Oil prices also fell as tensions between the US and Iran showed signs of easing. The market's ups and downs this week were influenced by various factors, including a weaker dollar and Donald Trump's threats against Iran.The tech sector's earlier optimism about AI, boosted by strong earnings from Meta, Samsung, and SK hynix, took a downturn after Microsoft's announcement. The company revealed plans to increase AI infrastructure spending, which worried investors about delayed returns on investment. This news had a significant impact on Microsoft's stock.""Microsoft suffered its worst session since the Covid‑era crash, falling 12 percent and accounting for over two‑thirds of the S&P 500's decline,"" said National Australia Bank's Rodrigo Catril, as quoted by AFP. He pointed out that investors were worried about rising costs and slower growth in cloud services.Most Asian markets struggled, with Hong Kong and Shanghai dropping more than 1%.Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Taipei, and Manila also fell, while Seoul and Wellington saw some gains. Jakarta continued to face challenges after MSCI raised concerns about ownership issues.Indian markets also opened at a low. While Nifty50 went below 25,300, BSE Sensex was down over 500 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,274.65, down 144 points or 0.57%. BSE Sensex was at 82,056.49, down 510 points or 0.62%.Gold prices retreated to around $5,200 per ounce after hitting $5,595, while silver dropped to $110 from its peak of over $121. The slight increase in the dollar value contributed to this decline, despite Trump's apparent comfort with a weaker US currency.Oil markets remained volatile, with prices falling more than 1% after Thursday's 5% surge. This came as Trump warned Iran about possible strikes while sending military forces to the region. However, fears persist about potential conflicts in the oil-rich area, which could drive up prices and inflation.The overall market sentiment reflects caution about tech valuations and concerns about possible market bubbles, as stocks have reached record highs in recent years largely due to tech sector growth.","Asian markets are mostly down on Friday as concerns about AI investments grow.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

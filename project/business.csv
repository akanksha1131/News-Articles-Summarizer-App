Potential Effects of Harris's Victory on India

Historical US Market Performance Analysis:

US Elections : Financial markets appear to be positioning for a Donald Trump victory and Republican dominance in the upcoming November 5 US presidential election, despite the race remaining undecided, according to an ET report.Analysts suggest that a Kamala Harris victory would maintain current economic conditions with minimal market impact, while a Trump win could significantly affect emerging markets, equities, and currencies through reduced globalization policies.""If Trump is elected as President, it could imply higher rates, gold prices, and global USD regime than our base-case forecasts, while crude prices could be lower. A Harris victory could mean that the markets could trade closer to our base-case projections with rates likely to ease and global USD to trade flat,"" ICICI Bank's head of economic research Sameer Narang said.Financial experts indicate that among emerging economies, India could benefit from a Trump presidency due to its domestic consumption-focused growth, potential advantages from reduced commodity prices, supply chain alterations, and foreign relations.A Trump administration's restrictive trade policies could sustain strong US growth, potentially leading to Wall Street's superior performance compared to global markets.Also Read | ‘Mr Modi is fantastic…’: Prem Watsa, known as ‘Canada’s Warren Buffett’, says India can grow at 10% under PM Modi This scenario could trigger increased yields, particularly in long-term securities, as investors anticipate higher supply. ICICI Bank analysts predict stronger US dollar performance, decreased Brent crude prices, lower global base metal prices affecting Chinese growth, and elevated gold prices due to increased safe-haven demand.ICICI Bank projects that with Trump's victory, the US 10-year Treasury yield could reach 4.40%-4.50%, while the Dollar Index might rise to 105-106, potentially reaching 106.50 by December 2024.Nomura's analysis suggests India's predominantly domestic demand-driven economy would experience limited negative effects from slower US growth.According to Nomura's Sonal Varma, India could actually benefit from reduced commodity prices resulting from decreased Chinese growth and lower oil prices, influenced by increased fossil fuel production.A decrease in crude oil prices would benefit Indian oil marketing companies including BPCL, IOCL, and HPCL, while potentially negatively affecting ONGC, Oil India, and GAIL.Also Read | PM Modi highlights Mark Mobius’ ‘love for India’; says renowned global investor believes 50% should be invested in Indian stock market A Harris victory in the election would likely maintain current global and US economic structures, with expectations of a gradual economic alignment between the US and other nations influencing mid-term market dynamics.ICICI Bank indicates that various financial markets, including equities, energy, gold, base metals, and the US dollar, would likely remain stable without significant fluctuations.""In case of a Harris victory, we see the UST 10yr moving to the 4.00%-4.10% range and the DXY trading in the 101.50-103.50 range by December 2024. Global commodity prices could trade flat if Harris wins,"" it said.India's export performance to the US could benefit under Democratic leadership, considering the positive trade relationship during Biden's administration. According to Phillip Capital, Harris's anticipated support for skilled immigration policies would benefit India's IT sector.The Dow Jones, excluding recession-related declines, increased 28% under Bush, 78% during Obama's presidency, and 54% under Trump, while Biden's current term shows 41% growth.The Indian markets showed substantial growth during different US presidencies: Bush's term saw a 200% increase, Obama's presidency witnessed 55% growth, Trump's tenure recorded 63% gains, and Biden's administration has achieved 89% growth so far.","Financial markets appear to be positioning for a Donald Trump victory and Republican dominance in the upcoming November 5 US presidential election.

(AI image)

DA Hike Calculator: How much will the take home salary increase?

To understand the impact of this 3% DA hike, let's consider an example:

Assuming a central government employee has a basic pay of Rs 46,200, their previous dearness allowance at 50% was Rs 23,100. With the DA now at 53%, their dearness allowance will increase to Rs 24,486.

This means they will receive an additional Rs 1,386 (Rs 24,486 - Rs 23,100) in DA from October. As the DA hike is effective from July 1, 2024, they will also receive arrears for the last three months.

DR Hike Calculator: How much will the pension increase?

If a central government pensioner receives a basic pension of Rs 50,400 per month, at the previous 50% DR, they were getting Rs 25,200.

With the DR now at 53%, they will receive Rs 26,712 monthly as dearness relief. This means their pension will increase by Rs 1,512 per month.

DA hike calculator : PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet has approved a 3% increase in the dearness allowance (DA) for central government employees on October 16, 2024. Additionally, the dearness relief (DR) for central government pensioners has also been raised by 3%. As a result of this latest hike, the DA and DR now stand at 53% for both central government employees and pensioners respectively. This decision is set to benefit over 1 crore individuals.The dearness allowance, a component of the salary for government employees and pensioners, has been increased to 53%. This rise in DA will lead to an increase in the take-home salary of central government employees starting from October 2024.The effective date for the increased DA and DR is July 1, 2024. The central government typically revises these allowances twice a year, in January and July, with official announcements being made at a later date. Consequently, the DA/DR hike is implemented retrospectively from the cut-off date of July 1, 2024.Also Read | Dearness allowance hiked!

MUMBAI: In a first of its kind order that can have implications for auditors, Sebi on Monday asked Embassy Office Parks Management Services, which manages Embassy REITs, to immediately suspend its CEO Aravind Maiya for failing to meet its “fit &proper” criteria for top executives.Sebi’s interim order is based on an order by National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) that barred Maiya from auditing for professional misconduct relating to a Rs 3,535-crore unauthorised fund diversion by subsidiaries of Coffee Day Enterprises to related entities. At that time, Maiya was a partner at KPMG affiliated BSR & Co that was auditing Coffee Day.When the Coffee Day fund diversion came to light following the suicide of its main promoter V G Siddharta in July 2019, Sebi investigated the matter and in Jan 2023 passed an order against the company. It also referred the case to NFRA to highlight the role of its auditors and the partners who had audited the company.The 27-page order by Ashwani Bhatia, a whole time member at Sebi, said that as the regulator of the securities markets and to protect investors in Embassy REIT, it was duty-bound “to ensure that the management of a registered intermediary is not dependent on an individual who has been hauled up for professional misconduct which contributed to concealment of a very large securities market fraud of a listed company under his watch”.The investors and the shareholders of Coffee Day had relied on its statutory auditor, including Maiya, to ensure that the company’s accounts conveyed a true and fair view of the state of financial affairs of the company. “By failing to fulfil the fiduciary duties entrusted to (Maiya), he has displayed professional incompetence and lack of integrity,” the Sebi order said.Sebi directed Embassy Office Parks to suspend Maiya and appoint an interim CEO till further order or in case the NFRA order is stayed. The order is also a show cause notice to Embassy Office Parks that can file its reply within 21 days.The order can have implications for other auditors who have been indicated for disciplinary reasons or for professional misconduct and are associated with other listed entities.","Sebi’s interim order is based on an order by National Financial Reporting Authority.

This comes just after Diwali when consumers often splurge on festive purchases, placing a strain on their wallets. Several fast-moving consumer goods companies have indicated that more price hikes may be in store.HUL, Marico, Tata Consumer Products and Dabur are among firms that have hiked prices. ""Erratic weather patterns have affected tea and salt production leading to input cost inflation.... staggered price increases have been actioned and you will see more price increases around the corner,"" Tata Consumer Products MD & CEO Sunil D'Souza said in a recent earnings call, adding that consumer demand is under stress.While price increases will translate into value growth for FMCG players, volume growth will be a challenge. In fact, companies are feeling the pinch on the ground. While urban India is curtailing consumption due to high food inflation, rural spending is not compensating enough for the urban slowdown. ""Since June, urban growth has moderated. While rural growth has become accretive to total growth, its pace of recovery has been gradual,"" said HUL MD & CEO Rohit Jawa. Stock price of all FMCG companies ended in the red on the BSE on Monday amid a broader bearish market ahead of the US presidential election.Within urban, the lower middle class segment has been impacted though govt schemes have partly helped in insulating bottom-of-the-pyramid segments from the impact of food inflation, said Saugata Gupta, MD & CEO at Marico, which has taken price increase in the coconut oil portfolio. ""We will take calibrated pricing actions in response to the rising trend in input costs. Food and retail inflation trends will be the key parameters to be tracked in the coming quarters,"" Gupta said, projecting a pick up in pricing growth in the second half of FY25.ITC saw inflationary headwinds across commodities including edible oil, wheat, maida and potato in Q2.

Most say a win for the Republican candidate Donald Trump could lead to heightened market volatility globally. They, along with economists, are also worried about the high level of deficit in the world’s largest economy which, if left unchecked, could cause severe uncertainty.“Markets are worried about the US not bringing its fiscal deficit in check,” Anish Tawakley of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, said. “Consequently, US bond yields have been rising. This could put pressure on equity (markets) globally.” On Monday evening, the US 10-year bond yield was hovering around the 4.29% level, a four-month high mark. This came despite a sharp 50 basis points (100 basis points = 1 percentage po int) rate cut by the US central bank on Sept 18 this year.In India, foreign funds continued their recent aggressive selling trend and took out a net Rs 4,330 crore from the stock market, data on BSE showed.

On Monday, for the first time since May this year, FPIs turned net sellers for 2024, combined data from NSDL and BSE showed.In the next few weeks, for domestic market players the monitorable factors are the state elections in Maharash tra and Jharkhand, the govt capex which has considerably slowed in recent months compared to last year and the urban consumption trend, which had supported economic growth while rural consumption remained muted.“Urban consumption, which had previously remained resilient, is also showing signs of slowing, adding to the pressure, especially as lower to middle-income households have already been under stress,” said Vinit Sambre of DSP Mutual Fund. “Heavy rains have been partly blamed for the slowdown, making it crucial to monitor the pace of recovery. If growth fails to pick up, it could pose further risks to both earnings and market performance.”In Monday’s market, though, selling was across the board, with sectoral indices representing real estate, oil & gas and utilities losing the most while IT stocks were mostly resilient.","The sensex cracked nearly 1,500 points mid-session to close 942 points lower, at 78,782 — a 3-month closing low.

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore. In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. The focus has shifted to modernisation of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112317825,imgsize-144990,width-400,resizemode-4/112317825.jpg"

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001.The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction.The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.",Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later."" Iyer adds, ""This is just a start and there may be more subscriber-friendly features as we take it to the market. The regulator is proactive and open to feedback.""","Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries.

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen?

He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112098027,imgsize-124986,width-400,resizemode-4/112098027.jpg"

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

A rise in retail-loan defaults in India due to aggressive lending practices is reverberating in the stock market, with analysts worrying about possible spillover into the broader economy.Concerns are mounting after lenders including Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and IndusInd Bank Ltd reported elevated stress in unsecured loans during second-quarter earnings, sending shares sliding. The pain is more acute in firms like Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Ltd that focus on smaller-ticket loans, with the stock down more than 30% this year.Personal-loan growth is moderating as the central bank last year clamped down on risky lending practices following a post-pandemic surge in credit. The impact is trickling into the market and company earnings, signaling more pain ahead for the world’s fastest-growing major economy.“The issue will continue for at least the next two quarters and slippages and credit costs will remain high,” said Yuvraj Choudhary, an analyst at Anand Rathi Securities. “If the demand for these loans doesn’t pick up in the festive season, the stress can last much longer.” Choudhary is underweight on the space.Last November, the Reserve Bank of India asked banks to set aside more capital for unsecured consumer credit, including small loans, as regulators grew concerned about borrowers buying items they could not afford. The increased cost of loans coupled with collection disruptions during the federal elections between April and June spurred a string of delinquencies.In August, personal loan growth slowed to 14% from over 30% in the year-ago period. Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Ltd and IIFL Finance Ltd warned in earnings calls last month they expect the challenging situation to continue in the coming quarters.Traders have already headed for the exit. Shares of microfinance lenders such as Fusion Finance Ltd and Spandana Sphoorty Financial Ltd are down more than 60% so far this year, in contrast to a 15% gain in the BSE 500 over the period.Private players have seen an impact too. Arohan Financial Services Pvt, which provides loans primarily to financially underserved women, is delaying an initial public offering. This followed an RBI order last month asking a group of shadow lenders to stop sanctioning new loans because of the high interest rates they charge customers.A slowdown in loans also translates to waning demand from consumers for large ticket purchases like cars. Disappointing earnings at several automakers put the sector among the worst-performing in October. Shares of consumer bellwether Hindustan Unilever and retail-chain Avenue Supermarts also plunged on similar concerns following the second-quarter results.“Consumption has suffered from a clear policy tilt toward infra-led growth,” said Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services. The defaults are gaining pace amid slowing wage growth in urban areas, while rural wages haven’t picked up meaningfully, she added. “Discretionary spending will definitely be affected.”",Rise in retail-loan defaults in India is reverberating in the stock market.

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi on Monday issued a warning to investors — its third this year — about unauthorised entities trying to engage investors through platforms and apps that could lead to losses. The proliferation of financial frauds is prompting Sebi to issue frequent advisories and warnings to investors.The advisory said that some apps/web applications/ platforms were offering virtual trading services, paper trading, fantasy games, etc, to the public based on stock prices of listed companies. Such activities are in violation of Sebi’s laws and regulations, which are “designed to protect investors”.This was a follow-up advisory from the regulator of its Aug 2016 one. At that time, Sebi had warned investors against leagues/schemes/ competitions related to securities markets, which might involve distribution of prize monies. “It is reiterated that the public can invest and undertake trading activities in the securities markets only through/with registered intermediaries. Participation in unauthorised schemes, including sharing of confidential and personal trading data, is at the investors’ own risk, cost and consequences,” since these schemes/ platforms are not registered with the regulator, it said.In Feb, Sebi had warned investors against fraudulent trading schemes that offered investors residing in India to enjoy the same benefits enjoyed by foreign institutional investors. Sebi had warned that fraudsters were enticing victims “through online trading courses, seminars, and mentorship programs in the stock market, leveraging social media platforms like WhatsApp or Telegram, as well as live broadcasts. Posing as employees or affiliates of Sebi-registered FPIs, they coax individuals into downloading applications that purportedly allow them to purchase shares, subscribe to IPOs, and enjoy “institutional account benefits” —all without the need for an official trading or demat account. These operations often use mobile numbers registered under false names to or chestrate their schemes”. Sebi told investors that the FPI route is not available to resident investors, except under certain specific conditions. Also all investors should have a demat account to invest in shares in India, it had said.Through another advisory in Feb, Sebi had warned investors that some unscrupulous entities were falsely claiming to be registered with the regulator and promising assured and high returns to investors on their investments.Sebi cautioned investors against placing their money with any entity based on such claims. “Investors are urged to conduct due diligence and verify the registration status of any entity claiming to be a Sebi-registered intermediary. It is imperative for investors to understand that investments offering high returns usually involve high risk including fraud risk and there can be no guarantees of assured returns in the securities market,” the advisory said."," Markets regulator Sebi on Monday issued a warning to investors about unauthorised entities trying to engage investors through platforms and apps.

Foreign investors are souring on India’s stock market, selling a record amount of shares amid signs the South Asian nation’s post-pandemic economic boom is losing steam.Global funds pulled out more than $10 billion on a net basis in October, helping drive the benchmark stock index toward a so-called technical correction. Sustained foreign investor outflows could act as a drag on near-term stock performance, according to Citigroup Inc.The past few years have seen India emerge as a preferred investment destination, thanks to its breakneck economic growth, surging corporate profits and a broader shift away from China. But some of that shine is now starting to fade as equity valuations have become among the priciest in the world, the pace of expansion in the economy and earnings is slowing and Chinese stocks are staging a comeback following a stimulus blitz since late September.“While the selling by foreign investors may not remain as severe, they will stay on the cautious side,” said Rajat Agarwal, an Asia equity strategist at Societe Generale SA. Agarwal, who tactically turned neutral on Indian equities in late 2023, said both earnings growth and valuations have “more room to moderate.”Consumers in Indian cities are cutting back on spending, with firms making everything from soaps to cars warning of a decline in urban middle-class demand due to inflation and poor job prospects. While rural consumers are showing signs of spending more thanks to a good monsoon season that boosted farm incomes, that can’t make up for the pullback among nearly 500 million city dwellers.Goldman Sachs Group Inc also tactically turned neutral on Indian equities from overweight last month, citing slowing economic growth and high valuations. Some economists project the economy to grow at less than 7% this fiscal year, down from more than 8% in the prior year.As foreign outflows picked up pace, the benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index lost 6.2% in October, its worst monthly performance since March 2020. The fiscal 2025 earnings estimate for the gauge’s components has seen a 2.2% cut during the ongoing reporting season, according to Jefferies Financial Group Inc.Still, the Nifty is up more than 10% in 2024, on track for an unprecedented ninth straight year of gains. Share purchases worth more than $50 billion by the nation’s domestic institutions this year have helped prevent a deeper market selloff.“Domestic liquidity can continue to support India’s stock market,” said Joanne Goh, senior investment strategist at Singapore-based DBS Bank. “We still think that earnings can grow at about 15% and the Sensex index can still reach another high.”India Stocks Have Trounced Global Peers Since Pandemic LowEven after the recent slump, the NSE Nifty 50 Index’s valuation remains the priciest in emerging Asia. The gauge is trading at more than 21 times its 12-month forward earnings, versus a five-year average multiple of 19.4 times.Global investors tend to invest in certain sectors within India, “and I think some of those have some stretched valuations,” Brian Kersmanc, a portfolio manager at GQG Partners, said on Bloomberg Television last week.Strategists at Bernstein Societe Generale Group expect some more weakness in Indian stocks heading into the year-end.“The market hasn’t yet fully priced in the extent of the slowdown that could be on the cards,” Venugopal Garre and Nikhil Arela wrote in a note. “Once reality hits, we expect a further but limited moderation in Nifty from current levels to ~23,500 — which remains our year-end target.”The gauge fell 1.3% on Monday, the most in a month, to finish at 23,995.35.","Global funds pulled out more than $10 billion on a net basis in October.

However, as the winds calmed down later in the day, the air started deteriorating, especially as harvest stubble burning in other states became a big factor in the capital's air purity.On Saturday, the air quality index on a scale of 0 to 500 improved to 290 in the ‘poor' category at 12 noon but by 3pm, it rose to the ‘very poor' level of 308. The average AQI on Saturday was 316 against 337 a day earlier. In the morning, despite the winds, some areas of the city remained quite polluted — Anand Vihar had an AQI of 385, RK Puram 352, and IGI Airport, 337.At 35.17%, stubble burning was the worst polluter on Friday, a day after Diwali, as per data from the Decision Support System of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology under the Union ministry of earth sciences. While no data on the contribution of stubble to pollution was given for Saturday, local transport was responsible for 14% of the city's PM2.5. However, as the winds calmed down in the afternoon, the pollution levels in these areas worsened. By 6pm, the AQI at Anand Vihar had touched the ‘severe' level at 407.According to weather analysts, it is likely that wind speed will drop further and, therefore, worsen the pollution status. IITM's air quality early warning system also expects the air to be in the ‘very poor' category.The early warning system bulletin said, ""Meteorological conditions are likely to be extremely unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor' category on Nov 2. The air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor' category from Nov 3 to Nov 5.

Canadian authorities were intimated about the camp, which was organised for the benefit of local life certificate beneficiaries

NEW DELHI: India condemned violence by proKhalistan separatists at a Hindu temple, and their efforts to disrupt Indian consular activities, in Brampton, Canada , with PM Modi taking to X to assert that the country’s resolve would not be weakened by such acts and sought action against the perpetrators.“I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada. Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats. Such acts of violence will never weaken India’s resolve. We expect the Canadian govt to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law,” Modi said hours after the foreign ministry condemned the incident that took place on Sunday. The ministry said New Delhi remained deeply concerned about the safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada and asked the Canadian authorities to ensure that all places of worship are protected from such attacks. New Delhi has repeatedly stated in the middle of its ongoing diplomatic spat with Ottawa that its main concern with Canada remains the space given by local authorities to pro-Khalistan separatists, allowing them to target Indian interests.On this occasion, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, who has been accused of being sympathetic to the Khalistan cause due to votebank considerations, said on X, “The acts of violence at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton today are unacceptable. Every Canadian has the right to practise their faith freely and safely. Thank you to Peel Regional Police for swiftly responding to protect the community and investigate this incident.”Canadian authorities had been intimated about the consular camp being organised in collaboration with the temple for the benefit of local life certificate beneficiaries.Video clips of Sunday’s assault purportedly showed pro-Khalistan demonstrators attacking a crowd of devotees in Hindu Sabha Mandir. One video purportedly showed police pinning down a Hindu youth and handcuffing him, drawing comparisons by commentators with the George Floyd incident in America and leading Canadian MP Chandra Arya to say that his suspicions about Khalistanis infiltrating Canadian law enforcement have been strengthened.Arya said the incident represented a “red line” crossed by Khalistani activists against Hindu devotees. He also referred to the aggressive conduct of Brampton police towards Hindus protesting against the attack.PM Modi’s statement is the second instance in recent months that he has taken up the issue of reported attacks on Hindus outside India. In August this year, he raised with Muhammad Yunus, chief adviser of Bangladesh, the alleged targeting of Hindus and other minorities post the regime change in the neighbouring country.In an official statement, the Indian govt said the outreach of Indian consular officers to provide services to Indians and Canadian citizens alike would not be deterred by intimidation, harassment and violence.“We condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by extremists and separatists at the Hindu Sabha temple in Brampton city in Ontario, yesterday,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.“We call on the govt of Canada to ensure that all places of worship are protected from such attacks. We also expect that those indulging in violence will be prosecuted,” Jaiswal said.On Sunday, Peel Regional Police said a protest occurred at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton and unverified videos circulating on social media appeared to show demonstrators holding banners in support of Khalistan, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported.The Indian high commission said it was disappointed to see such disruptions being allowed for routine consular work being organised with the fullest cooperation of local co-organisers.“We remain concerned for the safety of applicants, including Indian nationals, on whose demand such events are organised in the first place. Despite these efforts by anti-India elements, our consulate was able to issue more than 1,000 life certificates to Indian and Canadian applicants,” it added.",PM Modi takes to X to assert that the country’s resolve would not be weakened by such acts.

He is also set to forfeit his salary and other incentives of up to $ 9.6 million.James McClements , who has been firm’s chairman since 2015 would also be leaving the company next year to restore the company’s shattered reputation.""There can be no doubt that the actions, decisions and behaviours of Mr Ellison have been profoundly disappointing and require sanction and penalty,"" McClements said.A shareholder in MinRes, HESTA said, ""governance failures that allow inappropriate behavior by management can pose a material financial risk to the long-term value of our members' investments.""The pension fund further added that it had been in discussions with MinRes and welcomed the board's actions to address governance concerns, including the CEO transition and the implementation of significant financial penalties, stating that ""this will help restore investor confidence and trust.""",Mineral Resources founder Chris Ellison will be exiting the firm within 18 months.

Investors from stocks to crypto brace for US election volatility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/investors-from-stocks-to-crypto-brace-for-us-election-volatility/articleshow/114931401.cms,"Once past the election, fundamental market flows are building up support for a rally into the end of the year.

Just before a hotly contested US election considered a toss-up, options traders across markets appear to be reducing risk and bracing for more volatility.Equity options volatility climbed through most of October even as the market’s swings were muted, in anticipation of not just the upcoming election but also earnings season and a Federal Reserve interest-rate decision. The race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is too close to call in the final days before the vote.Bond yields have been rising since the Fed cut rates in September, leading investors to pull back on some futures positions and add tail-risk hedges on higher rates. For the most part, currency traders are betting on wider swings, with volatility for the yuan, Mexican peso and euro increasing on uncertainty about trade and tariffs.“Positioning is pretty clean” after some general de-risking the past few weeks into the election and Fed meeting, said Stuart Kaiser, a US equity trading strategist at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. “That is good for risk/reward post election depending on result of course. Bonds seem to be moving more than stocks.”Here’s a look at how options traders are positioning across various asset classes, from equities to crypto :As expected, much of the hedging for the election has showed up at the last minute, as shorter-term options make it easier to position closer to an event. Implied volatility is running well above realized levels, with investors bracing for wider swings even as the S&P 500 Index went 29 sessions without a drop of more than 1%.“We continue to see an interest in trades around the election with a pick up in recent days,” said Daniel Kirsch, head of options at Piper Sandler & Co. “Clients who expect Donald Trump to win the election are adding exposure to financials and crypto stocks, those who are betting on a Harris win buy options on renewable-energy stocks. There’s also a pick up in hedging with traders piling into put options for the S&P 500 and QQQ ETF.”Shorter-term S&P 500 implied volatility has been running hot relative to one-month levels, as the election and Fed bump percolates through the calculation of the shorter-term measure. The Cboe VVIX Index — which measures the volatility of the VIX — is also elevated.“Currently, the options skew is steep and VIX is much higher than realized volatility,” said Zhiwei Ren, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. “These are signs that the market is well hedged at this point.”While volatility has been elevated, it’s pointing to about a 1.7% move for the S&P 500 the day after the election — not an outrageous swing. The implied move has fallen steadily from a peak of around 2% in early October to be about in line with the long-term average for past elections, according to Stefano Pascale, head of US equity-derivatives strategy at Barclays Plc.Beyond the general indexes, some sectors, such as crypto and clean-energy stocks, are seeing a surge in volatility well above their medians. Crypto stocks are pricing almost 10% moves, Morgan Stanley’s trading desk said last week, and those for renewable firms around 6%. That’s playing out in positioning, where, for example, more than 20,000 November call spreads were bought last week in Sunrun Inc.Once past the election, fundamental market flows are building up support for a rally into the end of the year, as hedges are taken off, mutual fund buying kicks in during November, companies repurchase shares and lower volatility draws in systemic buying and rehedging by option dealers.“Assuming a smooth post-election period, we believe these hedges may unwind and we could see a sharp drop of VIX and flatter skew,” said Ren. “If both happen, it could force more buyers into the market and push the market higher.”Short-term currency options that are now pricing in risk around the election have seen an implied volatility jump in anticipation of wider swings after the US vote. One-week dollar-yuan swings hit a record high late last week as traders hedged against the possibility of higher US tariffs that Trump has threatened and a global trade war that could especially hurt China.Volatility in the euro — also vulnerable to any trade tariffs that a victory for Trump could entail — has risen the most since 2020, reaching its highest level since March 2023, while risk reversals remain bearish on the euro versus the dollar. One-week volatility on the peso has climbed to the highest in more than four years, and its premium to expected swings further out in time widened to the highest since Bloomberg began compiling data in 2007.Positioning in the Treasuries market over the past couple of weeks has been focused toward traders de-leveraging positions in futures, skewed toward long liquidations amid rising expectations of a post-election boost to fiscal stimulus, swelling the supply of Treasuries. The result has seen open interest, or the amount of positions held by traders, drop sharply in 10-year note futures since the start of October as yields have climbed.The de-risking, or traders taking chips off the table, has also been reflected in the cash market, where the latest survey from JPMorgan Chase & Co. shows clients reducing both long and short positions, as neutrals rise. In the options market for Treasuries, tail-risk hedges sit at higher yields and a bigger bond market selloff versus current levels. The 109.50 December 10-year put is notably populated, equivalent to a yield of approximately 4.5% and around 25 basis points higher than current levels.“Election volatility premium is most pronounced in the bond market on long-end rates, which we believe reflects concerns over higher fiscal risks on a sweep outcome,” said Tanvir Sandhu, Bloomberg Intelligence’s chief global derivatives strategist. “The skew suggests demand for hedges using payer swaptions against a selloff in long-end rates.”Crypto traders are diverging on the election result, with the options market turning from aggressively bullish to a more hedge-focused approach. The implied volatility for short-term contracts such as the 14-day puts has risen significantly while calls with the same expiration remain stable, according to data compiled by crypto liquidity provider B2C2.While there is no clear directional bias with heightened volatility going into the election, increasing premium for calls across longer tenors and termed Bitcoin futures on CME point to a bullish outlook beyond the election, with more rate cuts and potential positive changes in crypto policies in sight next year.Binary options — in which a payout is triggered if a pair of conditions are met, such as a currency and a stock reaching pre-determined levels — tend to be a popular way to hedge possible outcomes around major events. Such trades have picked up going in the election, according to Esmail Afsah, a derivatives strategist at JPMorgan.“I suspect this is mainly because investors have firm views on how individual assets are likely to behave in the four key permeations of the US election,” Afsah said. “Using hybrid options and betting on the direction of two assets concurrently allows to increase leverage materially and thus improve odds, providing of course that assets do indeed behave as expected.”"," options traders across markets appear to be reducing risk and bracing for more volatility.

OMAHA: Warren Buffett is now sitting on more than USD 325 billion cash after continuing to unload billions of dollars worth of Apple and Bank of America shares this year and continuing to collect a steady stream of profits from all of Berkshire Hathaway 's assorted businesses without finding any major acquisitions. Berkshire said it sold off more Apple shares in the third quarter after halving its massive investment in the iPhone maker last quarter. The stake valued at USD 69.9 billion at the end of September remains Berkshire's biggest single investment, but it has been cut drastically since the end of last year when it was worth USD 174.3 billion.Berkshire said Saturday that investment gains again drove its third quarter profits skyward to USD 26.25 billion, or USD 18,272 per Class A share. A year ago, unrealised paper investment losses dragged the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's earnings down to a loss of USD 12.77 billion, or USD 8,824 per Class A share.Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings if they want to get a good sense of how the businesses it owns are doing because those numbers exclude investments. Berkshire's bottom-line profit figures can vary widely from quarter to quarter along with the value of its investments regardless of whether the company bought or sold anything.By that measure, Berkshire said its operating earnings were only down about 6% at USD 10.09 billion, or USD 7,023.01 per Class A share. That compares to last year's USD 10.8 billion, or USD 7,437.15 per Class A share.The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted that Berkshire would report operating earnings of USD 7,335.11 per Class A share.Berkshire's revenue didn't change much at USD 92.995 billion. A year ago, it reported USD 93.21 billion revenue. That number was ahead of the USD 92.231 billion revenue that three analysts surveyed by FactSet predicted.Berkshire owns an assortment of insurance businesses, including Geico, along with BNSF railroad, several major utilities and a varied collection of retail and manufacturing businesses, including brands like Dairy Queen and See's Candy.",Berkshire Hathaway is now sitting on more than USD 325 billion cash after continuing to unload billions of dollars worth of Apple and Bank of America shares this year.

The ""Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2024: Insights for COP29 "" report, published by global think tank Climate Policy Initiative (CPI), said climate finance currently represents only 1 per cent of global GDP, far short of the required level.Emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) may need around 6.5 per cent of their GDP by 2030 to meet climate goals.""While global climate finance has made some strides, a much more ambitious, cohesive, and effective approach is essential to address the vast funding gap,"" said Barbara Buchner, CPI''s Global Managing Director.""The data from CPI's Global Landscape report leaves no doubt that investment needs to scale across all fronts -- domestically, internationally, and across sectors -- to reach our mutual climate goals. COP29 is an opportunity to establish clear, collaborative commitments to finance the transformation needed for a sustainable future.""Annual climate finance flows rose from $ 674 billion in 2018 to $ 1.459 trillion in 2022. However, a fivefold increase is still needed to reach the $ 7.4 trillion required annually through 2030 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the report said.Alarmingly, fossil fuel investments continued to rise globally throughout 2023 and 2024, surpassing $ 1 trillion despite global commitments to reduce fossil fuel investments. Subsidies for fossil fuel consumption in emerging economies increased fivefold during the same period, it noted.At the UN climate conference in the UAE in 2023, countries reached a historic agreement to transition away from fossil fuels.At this year's UN climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries are expected to agree on a new climate finance target that developed countries need to provide to developing countries, beginning in 2025, to combat and adapt to climate change.The CPI's report warns that economic losses by 2100 could be five times greater than the climate finance needed by 2050 to stay within the 1.5-degree Celsius limit.The report also said that adaptation finance more than doubled from 2018 to 2022, reaching $ 76 billion. However, annual adaptation flows have reached just one-third of the volume needed each year from 2024 to 2030 in EMDEs alone.According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), adopted in 1992, high-income, industrialized nations -- which have historically benefited from industrialization and contributed most to greenhouse gas emissions -- are responsible for providing finance and technology to help developing countries combat and adapt to climate change.These countries include the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and EU member states such as Germany and France.Developing and poorer countries view an ambitious new climate finance goal as crucial to increasing climate action. They argue that expecting them to do more, especially when many are still grappling with poverty and inadequate infrastructure amid worsening climate impacts, undermines the principle of equity.","Global investment in combating and adapting to climate change reached nearly $ 1.5 trillion, doubling between 2018 and 2022.

Tax experts and economists have also been advocating for further rationalisation of income tax slabs under the new income tax regime, and a hike in standard deduction to give more disposable income in the hands of the middle class.Any changes in the income tax slabs and income tax rates, if they come, are likely only under the new income tax regime since the government has been pushing for its adoption. As per government data, 72% taxpayers have switched to the new income tax regime.Union Budget 2025 comes at a time when the GDP growth has slowed to a two year low of 5.4% and a cut in income tax rates is being advocated as a way to boost consumption in the economy.This is the second Budget of the Modi 3.0 government and the eighth Budget for Nirmala Sitharaman as Finance Minister.All eyes are now on FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget 2025 speech to see if FY 2025-26 will be a year of lower income tax burden or not.","PM Modi’s mention of the middle class in the context of the Budget session, and a day ahead of the Union Budget speech, has left everyone wondering if Budget 2025 will provide a much-needed income tax relief to the common man.

Fresh policy response must to cut China grip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fresh-policy-response-must-to-cut-china-grip/articleshow/117811648.cms,"China's domination of global manufacturing has prompted the Economic Survey to suggest fresh policy responses, especially in case of electric vehicles, green energy and critical minerals, as it reminded that the dragon's vice-like grip had caused major shocks to major industrialised nations.""China's rise in the global auto market has disrupted the long-term incumbents in economies like Germany and Japan, and it dominates the global distribution of critical minerals and other economic resources, creating potential dependencies for posterity,"" it said.The document pointed out how Chinese companies were dominating the global supply chain, controlling over 80% of the production capacity in solar power equipment and being home to the world's top 10 producers. Similarly, it controlled 80% of the battery manufacturing capacity, processed 70% of the rare minerals and was home to 60% of the wind energy capacity.While govt has been promoting clean energy and green mobility through schemes such as PLI, the govt paper said that almost 75% of the lithium-ion batteries came from China, pointing to a need for diversifying the supply chain.A similar recalibration on EVs was also suggested as these vehicles required six times more minerals than their conventional counterparts. And this is where China enters the frame, controlling the majority of the critical mineral production and processing, be it cobalt, nickel or lithium.With two-thirds of the rare minerals mined by China and 90% processed by it, the mines ministry has concluded that 245 of the 33 critical minerals vital to India's economic security faced high risk of supply disruptions.""As demand for EVs is expected to grow, dependence on imported components such as DC motors, e-motor magnets, and other electrical parts will likely rise. Leading EV manufacturers have noted an increasing proportion of Chinese imports in their total material expenditures, reflecting a significant dependence on China for certain resources and technical knowhow,"" the survey said.So, what's the solution? More partnerships with other countries, diversification of supply chain and focus on public transport, especially when Indians have poor access to these services.","China's vice-like grip has caused major shocks to major industrialised nations.

Although impact of AI on labour will be felt across the world, the problem is magnified for India, given its size and its relatively low per capita income.If companies do not optimise introduction of AI over a longer horizon and do not handle it with sensitivity, the demand for policy intervention and the demand on fiscal resources to compensate will be irresistible. The state, in turn, has to resort to taxation of profits generated from the replacement of labour with technology to mobilise those resources. It will leave everyone worse off and the country's growth potential will suffer, as a result.""In line with the focus on AI across the world, the survey dedicated a full chapter to the subject, talking not just about potential dangers to jobs, especially in middle- and lower-quartiles, but also pointing to the potential benefits to output as well as quality of services and production. ""Protracted labour displacement is something that a labour-surplus country like India cannot afford.""It said India is a majorly services driven economy, with a significant share of the IT workforce employed in low value-added services. ""Such jobs are the most susceptible to automation, as firms in a bid to cut costs may substitute labour for technology... India is also a consumption-based economy, thus the fall in consumption that can result from the displacement of its workforce is bound to have macroeconomic implications. If the worst-case projections materialise, this could have the potential to set the country's economic growth trajectory off course.""However, being a services-driven economy, AI will also help in enhancing the productivity of the country's workforce. ""Further, the younger population makes a rich talent pool available for capitalising on emerging technologies.""The survey highlighted that expectations point toward a trend where AI begins outperforming humans in critical decision-making processes in areas like healthcare, criminal justice, education, business and financial services, among others.","The corporate sector has to display a high degree of social responsibility.

However, it refrained from reiterating the point made in last year's survey about the inadequacy of monetary policy to address food prices.The survey expects food inflation to ease in Q4 FY25, driven by seasonal reductions in vegetable prices and Kharif harvest arrivals, with strong Rabi production likely to help stabilise prices in the first half of FY26.Despite this, risks remain from adverse weather and rising international agricultural commodity prices. While global energy and commodity prices have softened, the core inflation outlook remains manageable, though global political and economic uncertainties continue to pose challenges.A normal southwest monsoon in 2024 has improved water levels in reservoirs, ensuring sufficient irrigation for the rabi crop. According to the first advanced estimates for 2024-25, Kharif foodgrain production is expected to rise by 5.7%, with rice and tur output projected to rise 5.9% and 2.5%, respectively, compared to FY24. This should help ease food inflation pressures, although rising international vegetable oil prices may still pose an upside risk. The govt has focused on controlling food inflation through various supply-side measures, including strengthening buffer stocks, periodic open market releases, subsidised retail sales, easing imports and preventing hoarding through stock limits.","The survey expects food inflation to ease in Q4 FY25, driven by seasonal reductions in vegetable prices and Kharif harvest arrivals.

Donald Trump Economy: Donald Trump inherits strong economy as US growth rate hits 2.8% in 2024 amid ongoing inflation concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-growth-data-donald-trump-inherits-strong-economy-as-us-growth-rate-hits-2-8-in-2024-amid-ongoing-inflation-concerns/articleshow/117746316.cms,"Consumer spending remains robust



Inflation pressures persist



Donald Trump inherits a healthy economy



Global comparison



The US economy wrapped up 2024 on a solid note, with consumer spending and government support playing key roles in driving growth, according to new data from the Commerce Department.Despite some challenges, the economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected. For the full year, GDP grew by 2.8%, a strong performance, although slightly down from the 2.9% growth in 2023.Consumer spending rose by 4.2% in the final quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since early 2023. This growth was up from 3.7% in the previous quarter. The economy also benefitted from government spending and continued investment, although business investment slowed, particularly in equipment spending, which fell sharply after two strong quarters.Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, said, ""Consumers have been the foundation of the economy, and they've been the biggest driver of resilient growth in 2024,"" as quoted by the AFP news agency. He believes this growth will continue, supported by low layoffs, healthy job growth, and rising wages.The report also showed ongoing inflation. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, increased by 2.5%, slightly up from 2.2% in the previous quarter.Despite these inflation pressures, the economy remained strong. A key part of GDP, which excludes volatile items like exports and inventories, grew by 3.2% in the third quarter, down from 3.4% in the previous quarter.President Donald Trump, who took office in January 2025, inherited a strong economy, with growth continuing despite high interest rates. Unemployment was 4.1% in December, and job gains stayed steady. The Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged in December, after cutting it three times since September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell was quoted as saying to the Associated Press, “We do not need to be in a hurry to make more cuts,” due to the economy’s strength.The US economy is growing strongly, while Europe is struggling, having seen zero growth at the end of last year. The European Central Bank recently lowered its benchmark rate due to weak performance. In the US, strong consumer spending, low unemployment, and rising wages have helped maintain growth, despite ongoing inflation concerns.Trump has promised to cut taxes and reduce business regulations, but his plans on tariffs and immigration might slow growth and raise prices. KPMG's chief economist, Diane Swonk, pointed out that the effects of these policies will take time. While some analysts expect growth to slow in 2025, they still believe the US economy will remain strong for now.","US economy grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slightly below the 2.4% that economists had expected.

Tesla reported lower than expected profits Wednesday but confirmed key 2025 benchmarks, saying it will return to sales volume growth and move forward with fully autonomous driving.The results -- the first since the return of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ally Donald Trump to the White House -- capped a mixed year for Tesla in which Musk's big bet on US electoral politics was countered by profit pressures as Tesla's streak of annual car volume growth came to an end.The electric car company reported fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter, where profits were boosted by a one-time tax benefit.Revenues rose two percent to $25.7 billion, also missing analyst estimates, but reflecting a more than doubling of sales in energy generation and storage.Musk has sought to temper expectations about Tesla's near-term financial growth, while employing superlatives in touting Tesla's autonomous driving and robotic ventures, saying they could make Tesla ""the most valuable company in the world by far,"" worth more than the ""next five companies combined.""Musk, who spent some $270 million or more to help Trump win the White House, largely steered clear of political subjects during the 65-minute conference call.The company has been confronted by intensifying EV competition in leading markets, including China and the United States, where General Motors and Ford have introduced more models.Another factor has been lower sales than expected from the Cybertruck, Musk's futuristic auto giant that has won cheers from Tesla fans and jeers from critics.But Tesla expects growth in 2025, saying in its earnings release that ""with the advancements in vehicle autonomy and the introduction of new products, we expect the vehicle business to return to growth in 2025.""The company confirmed plans to unveil new, more affordable vehicles in 2025 and said its launch of a new robotaxi venture in parts of the United States was on track to begin this year.Tesla named its driver-assistance programs ""autopilot"" and ""full self-driving"" (FSD), even though the programs require the driver to maintain attention, while rival robotaxi venture Waymo has achieved full driverless functionality in three US cities so far.Musk has repeatedly missed earlier targets towards full autonomy, quipping during Wednesday that he was like the boy who cried wolf.""But I'm telling you, there's a damn wolf this time, and you can drive it,"" Musk said. ""In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf.""Musk said he intends to launch FSD as a paid service in Austin, Texas this year, where the company also plans to introduce robotaxi services.""Teslas will be in the wild,"" he said, describing a gradual expansion of service once the company can demonstrate its autonomous service is ""unequivocally safer"" than a human driver.Musk did not directly comment on how his alliance with Trump will affect Tesla.The billionaire's widening influence and activism on behalf of far-right political movements has drawn rising attention and blowback. Polling data released Wednesday by YouGov showed Musk with a 44 percent favorable public opinion compared with a 48 percent negative.That's a worse ratio than Trump, who came in at three points net-positive, according to YouGov.A coalition that includes a public workers union has filed a lawsuit to block Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, arguing the panel flouts federal laws and is ""beset"" by the conflicts of interest of an extremist ""libertarian billionaire class.""And only days after being criticized for a hand gesture at Trump's inauguration that resembled a Nazi salute, Musk drew scrutiny last weekend for reiterating support for Germany's far-right, anti-immigrant AfD party, including comments that young Germans should feel able ""to move beyond"" expressing regret for the Holocaust.During the call, Musk's most overtly political comment concerned what he described as the cumbersome process to introduce FSD in Europe, calling Europe ""a layer cake of regulations and bureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed.""Shares of Tesla rose 4.4 percent in after-hours trading.","Tesla reports fourth-quarter profits of $2.3 billion, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter.

DeepSeek: How a nerd with ‘terrible haircut’ shook up Silicon Valley's AI race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/deepseek-how-a-nerd-with-terrible-haircut-shook-up-silicon-valleys-ai-race/articleshow/117693138.cms,"The independent research group envisioned by High-Flyer took shape as DeepSeek. High-Flyer's founder and controlling shareholder, Liang Wenfeng, also serves as DeepSeek's discreet leader.

Poll Do You Believe DeepSeek's Success Will Lead to More Global AI Competition? No, Nvidia Will Continue to Lead Yes, It Could Disrupt the Current AI Market

Why it matters

DeepSeek’s AI is more than just another chatbot—it’s a symbol of China’s growing technological self-sufficiency. Its breakthrough challenges the long-standing assumption that the US holds an insurmountable lead in artificial intelligence.

At the core of US confidence was the belief that China needed American technology—particularly advanced semiconductors from Nvidia—to train competitive AI models. To maintain its dominance, Washington banned the export of high-end AI chips to China in 2022 and further tightened restrictions in 2023. Many assumed these moves would kneecap China’s AI ambitions.

Yet, DeepSeek has shattered that certainty. The company claims it trained its AI model using only 2,000 Nvidia chips , whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models. Even more astonishingly, OpenAI reportedly spent $1 billion on training ChatGPT, while DeepSeek did it with just about $6 million.

, whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models. Even more astonishingly, OpenAI reportedly spent $1 billion on training ChatGPT, while DeepSeek did it with just about $6 million. If these claims hold true, it could fundamentally reshape the AI industry. The assumption that cutting-edge AI requires enormous computing power, billion-dollar investments, and thousands of advanced chips may no longer be valid. Instead, DeepSeek has demonstrated that a highly efficient approach to AI training could level the playing field—allowing smaller players, and even adversarial nations, to catch up quickly.

Between the lines: How did DeepSeek pull this off?

1. A different approach to AI training:

This is akin to a search engine librarian:

2. A strategic stockpile of Nvidia chips

3. China’s ‘AI super geeks’ approach

A Trojan horse?

The rise of DeepSeek raises a troubling question for Washington: Could this technology be a Trojan horse? Under Chinese law, all tech companies are required to “cooperate with national intelligence efforts.” This means that any data fed into DeepSeek’s chatbot could, in theory, be accessible to the Chinese state.

Some analysts fear that DeepSeek’s chatbot could function as an AI-powered intelligence-gathering tool, subtly siphoning off user information under the guise of casual interactions. Others point to its built-in political censorship—when asked about topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre or China’s treatment of Uyghurs, DeepSeek either refuses to answer or echoes the Chinese government’s official stance.

With TikTok already under scrutiny in the US for alleged data harvesting, DeepSeek’s explosive rise is triggering similar concerns. The White House’s AI task force is reportedly investigating whether the platform poses a national security risk. “We should be alarmed,” said Ross Burley, co-founder of the Centre for Information Resilience. “Beijing has repeatedly weaponized its tech dominance for surveillance, control, and coercion,” Burley told Guardian.

What they’re saying

DeepSeek’s sudden rise has sparked polarizing reactions across the tech world:

President Donald Trump: Called DeepSeek a ""wake-up call"" for US industries, warning that China’s AI leap could threaten American economic and national security.

Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO): Praised DeepSeek as “impressive” and welcomed the competition, despite previously framing AI development as a battle between democracy and authoritarianism.

Elon Musk: Expressed doubts, suggesting that DeepSeek downplayed its use of banned US chips.

US National Security Officials: Are now investigating potential data security risks, given that DeepSeek stores user data on servers in China—raising concerns about state surveillance.

What’s next?

DeepSeek’s rise throws a wrench into Washington’s AI strategy. The US has aggressively restricted China’s access to advanced AI chips, believing that these controls would slow Beijing’s progress. But DeepSeek’s breakthrough suggests that China has found ways to innovate despite these restrictions.

Stronger US export controls : The Trump administrations will likely tighten AI-related export bans.

: The Trump administrations will likely tighten AI-related export bans. Restrictions may expand beyond hardware, targeting software and cloud-based AI services to further limit China’s progress.

Increased scrutiny of Chinese AI companies: US and European regulators may investigate DeepSeek’s funding sources to determine whether the Chinese government played a role.

US and European regulators may investigate DeepSeek’s funding sources to determine whether the Chinese government played a role. Concerns over data security could lead to bans on DeepSeek’s AI in Western markets, similar to TikTok’s ongoing legal battles.

US push for AI supremacy: The DeepSeek shock may accelerate government funding for AI innovation.

The DeepSeek shock may accelerate government funding for AI innovation. Trump’s $500 billion ""Stargate"" AI initiative could gain bipartisan support as Washington scrambles to ensure US leadership in AI.

Bottom line

China’s AI industry has delivered a seismic shock to the world. DeepSeek , a little-known startup, has unveiled a generative AI model that is reportedly as powerful as OpenAI’s ChatGPT—but developed at a fraction of the cost. This breakthrough, described by Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen as a ""Sputnik moment,"" has rattled global tech markets.The fallout was immediate. US tech stocks suffered a bloodbath, losing nearly $1 trillion in value in a single day. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, saw $589 billion wiped off its market capitalization in what is now the largest one-day loss for any company in US history. The panic was fueled by fears that China’s AI could compete—and even surpass—US advancements while circumventing Washington’s chip restrictions.DeepSeek’s rise represents a stunning reversal of expectations. Just two years ago, China’s AI scene was seen as lagging behind the US. Beijing’s early attempts at ChatGPT-like models, such as Baidu’s Ernie and Tencent’s Hunyuan, were dismissed as inferior copies. Now, DeepSeek has positioned itself as a real contender, proving that China’s AI talent and research ecosystem are capable of groundbreaking innovation.DeepSeek’s success hinges on an unconventional training method. Traditional AI models process vast amounts of data, requiring massive computational resources. DeepSeek’s approach is different—it prioritizes knowing where to look for answers rather than memorizing everything.Traditional AI models behave like a librarian who has read every book in the library and pulls from memory to answer questions. DeepSeek’s model doesn’t read every book in advance. Instead, it quickly finds the right book when asked a question—a more efficient and cost-effective approach. This technique, combined with a “mixture of experts” strategy—which assigns specialized AI models to different types of questions—dramatically reduces the computing power needed to train AI.While the US tried to block China from accessing advanced AI chips, DeepSeek found a loophole. Before Washington closed the door in 2023, DeepSeek and other Chinese firms stockpiled tens of thousands of Nvidia’s A100 and H800 chips.These chips, though slightly less powerful than Nvidia’s cutting-edge H100, were still good enough for training DeepSeek’s AI. Some experts, including Elon Musk, have speculated that DeepSeek may have secretly acquired more high-end chips than disclosed.The brains behind DeepSeek is a 39-year-old Chinese hedge funder named Liang Wenfeng . As per a CNN report, in interviews with the state-linked financial outlet Yicai, early business associates described the future DeepSeek founder as somewhat “nerdy” and recalled “a terrible haircut” he once had.Liang Wenfeng believes in hiring fresh graduates over experienced professionals. His rationale?Experienced engineers follow conventional approaches. Young engineers are more willing to experiment and think outside the box. This philosophy appears to have worked. Liang’s team of under 140 researchers—mostly graduates from China’s elite universities—designed a breakthrough AI system in record time. Their success has boosted morale in China’s tech industry, with Liang now celebrated as one of China’s ""AI heroes.""DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough signals a shift in the global AI landscape. While it’s unclear if China will ultimately overtake the US in AI, one thing is certain: Silicon Valley’s AI monopoly is no longer guaranteed.(With inputs from agencies)","DeepSeek claims it trained its AI model using only 2,000 Nvidia chips, whereas OpenAI and Google typically require 16,000+ chips for comparable models. Even more astonishingly, OpenAI reportedly spent $1 billion on training ChatGPT, while DeepSeek did it with just about $6 million.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117693504,imgsize-220884,width-400,resizemode-4/117693504.jpg"
'DeepSeek DID NOT build OpenAI for USD 5M' : Bernstein dismisses the Chinese company's claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/deepseek-did-not-build-openai-for-usd-5m-bernstein-dismisses-the-chinese-companys-claims/articleshow/117678472.cms,"Was it really $ 5 million?

DeepSeek, a new AI company seen as a potential rival to OpenAI, has gained massive success across social media, sending global stock markets into a frenzy. However, a recent report by Bernstein cautioned that while the company’s achievements are impressive, the claims of building an AI system comparable to OpenAI for just $5 million are not true.The report said that the claim is misleading and does not reflect the bigger picture.Bernstein stated, ""We believe that DeepSeek DID NOT ""build OpenAI for USD 5M""; the models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles; and the resulting Twitter-verse panic over the weekend seems overblown"".The report said that DeepSeek developed two main AI models: the DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek R1. The V3 model, a large language model, utilises a mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture, which combines multiple smaller models to achieve high performance while using fewer computing resources than traditional large models.On the other hand, the V3 model boasts 671 billion parameters, with 37 billion active at any given time, and incorporated with innovations like multi-head latent attention (MHLA) to reduce memory usage and mixed-precision training with FP8 computation for greater efficiency.Training the V3 model involved a cluster of 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs over a two-month period which sums up around 5.5 million GPU hours.While some estimates put the training cost at approximately $ 5 million, the report highlighted that this figure only considers the computational resources, leaving out the significant costs related to research, experimentation, and other developmental expenses.The DeepSeek R1 model builds upon the V3’s foundation by using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and other techniques to enhance reasoning capabilities. The R1 model has performed competitively with OpenAI’s models in reasoning tasks. However, Bernstein pointed out that the additional resources required to develop the R1 model were substantial, though not detailed in DeepSeek’s research paper.Commenting on the hype, Bernstein noted that DeepSeek's models are impressive.For example, the V3 model performs as well as or better than other large models in language, coding, and mathematics while consuming a fraction of the computational resources. Pre-training the V3 model required just 2.7 million GPU hours, or only 9 per cent of the compute resources needed for some leading models.In conclusion, while DeepSeek’s advancements are noteworthy, the report urged caution in the face of exaggerated claims. While the company’s work is groundbreaking, the notion of creating an OpenAI competitor for just $ 5 million appears to be false.","DeepSeek, a new AI company seen as a potential rival to OpenAI, has gained massive success across social media, sending global stock markets into a frenzy.

Three years ago, Liang Wenfeng 's quantitative hedge fund firm apologised profusely to investors for losing money during a tumultuous period for China's stock market.It was a surprising stumble for Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management , which used artificial intelligence to pick stocks and had grown rapidly to become one of the country's largest quant funds. As the firm navigated through that crisis and its assets shrunk by more than a third from a peak of more than $12 billion, behind the scenes Liang was laying the groundwork for a new AI startup, DeepSeek .DeepSeek, which grew out of High-Flyer, is now threatening to upend the global AI supply chain and challenge the seemingly-unassailable US lead in critical frontier AI technologies. The sudden popularity of the 20-month-old firm's breakthrough technology and its namesake app sparked a massive US and European stock rout on Monday, wiping out close to $1 trillion in combined market value from chip giant Nvidia and other peers.It has also drawn shock and awe over how Liang, an engineering graduate who has never studied or worked outside of mainland China, pulled off such a feat. He has demonstrated that with local artificial intelligence engineers, constrained access to the latest semiconductor technologies and limited resources, it is possible to match - and even surpass - the best in the field.The question now gripping investors, companies and policymakers is whether artificial intelligence requires hundreds of billions of dollars in capital expenditure to come up with the latest innovations and vanguard AI models - and whether export controls can hold off Chinese competition.Liang has been compared to OpenAI founder Sam Altman, but the Chinese citizen keeps a much lower profile and seldom speaks publicly. ""OpenAI is not a god and cannot always be at the forefront,"" Liang told Chinese media outlet 36Kr in July 2024.The previous year, Liang said more investment doesn't necessarily lead to more innovation. He has also opined on how Chinese companies have long been mostly followers as opposed to technology innovators. The problem has been a ""lack of confidence and not knowing how to organize high-density talents to achieve effective innovation,"" he was quoted as saying.Liang was born in 1985 in Zhanjiang, an economically poor city in China's southern Guangdong province. His father was an elementary school teacher. He studied electronic engineering at Zhejiang University, a prestigious college in the city of Hangzhou, and also earned a master's degree in information and communication engineering there.DeepSeek's research was funded by High-Flyer's R&D budget, Liang said previously. It drew computing resources from the quant fund, which had amassed 10,000 Nvidia GPUs in 2021, prior to US bans on exports of sophisticated Nvidia chips and GPUs.Liang recruited engineering talent almost exclusively from China. Many were fresh out of top universities, interns in their final leg of doctoral studies and Olympiad medal holders. bloomberg","Liang Wenfeng's quantitative hedge fund firm apologised profusely to investors for losing money during a tumultuous period for China's stock market.

Coca-Cola has recalled certain batches of its soft drinks across Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands after routine safety checks at its Ghent production plant revealed higher-than-normal levels of chlorate. The affected products include Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite, Minute Maid, and Fuze Tea, with production codes ranging from 328 GE to 338 GE.Chlorate, a byproduct of chlorine disinfectants used in water treatment, can potentially disrupt thyroid function, especially in children. The European Union's rapid alert system notified health authorities in Denmark, Portugal, and Romania to investigate whether contaminated drinks had reached store shelves or vending machines in those countries. The risk was categorised as ""serious.""Coca-Cola has assured consumers that the issue was traced to a single container used in the water treatment process at its Ghent facility. The company has urged customers not to consume drinks from the affected batches and to return them for refunds. ""We apologise to consumers and our commercial partners,"" Coca-Cola said in a statement.While the recall raised concerns, experts have reassured the public. Philippe Jorens, a professor at Antwerp University Hospital, told Belgian public broadcaster VTM that consuming harmful levels of chlorate from the affected drinks would require ingesting significant quantities.In addition, a small number of potentially contaminated drinks were shipped to France, Germany, and Great Britain, but no recalls were issued in those countries. “We are also in contact with authorities in a very small number of European markets – France, Germany, and Great Britain – where a very limited quantity of stock was also shipped,” the company said.","Routine safety checks at its Ghent production plant revealed higher-than-normal levels of chlorate.

Poll Is DeepSeek's AI Technology Superior to Other Available AI Tools? No, It Still Has a Long Way to Go Yes, It’s a Game Changer

The trigger?

Why it matters

DeepSeek’s announcement is more than a technological milestone—it’s a direct challenge to Silicon Valley’s dominance in AI. For years, US companies like OpenAI and Google have relied on their ability to spend billions on AI infrastructure and development, creating an almost unassailable competitive moat. Nvidia’s dominance in AI chips has fueled a skyrocketing valuation, with its GPUs seen as indispensable for training large language models (LLMs).

But DeepSeek’s revelation threatens to undercut this economic model. By demonstrating that high-performing AI models can be developed cheaply using fewer resources, the company has thrown into question the sustainability of these enormous capital expenditures. If the cost of training AI drops significantly, demand for high-end GPUs, advanced data centers, and specialized cloud services could fall, upending the financial prospects of US tech titans.

DeepSeek’s “Sputnik moment”

The scale and efficiency of DeepSeek’s breakthrough have led to comparisons with the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik in 1957—a moment that catalyzed the space race. Silicon Valley heavyweight Marc Andreessen called the R1 model “AI’s Sputnik moment” and “one of the most amazing breakthroughs” in the field. Even President Donald Trump weighed in, describing the development as a “wake-up call” for US industries. “Instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same solution,” he said.

Zhou Hongyi , the CEO of Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, declared that the company had “upended the world.” Others called it proof that China was closing the gap with the U.S. in AI technology. The breakthrough has renewed confidence in Beijing’s ability to outmaneuver U.S. sanctions and technological barriers.

Impact on Silicon Valley’s AI giants

Nvidia Stock Beaten Down Due to DeepSeek

The new economics of AI

Geopolitical implications

A turning point for markets

For over two years, artificial intelligence (AI) has driven one of the most dramatic stock market rallies in history. Nvidia, the chipmaking giant and cornerstone of the AI revolution, became synonymous with the soaring optimism surrounding AI’s potential to reshape industries. Yet, on Monday, this euphoria came to a screeching halt. Nvidia suffered a historic $589 billion loss in market value—the largest one-day drop for a company in Wall Street history—sparking widespread panic in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and wiping nearly $1 trillion from global markets.A Chinese startup called DeepSeek , which last week announced a breakthrough in AI technology that threatens to upend the economics of the industry. The Hangzhou-based company introduced its R1 AI model, claiming it could rival the most advanced models from Silicon Valley titans like OpenAI and Google—for a fraction of the cost. The disruptive potential of DeepSeek’s innovation rattled investor confidence, sending ripples through the global tech ecosystem.Monday’s selloff was nothing short of catastrophic. Nvidia’s stock plummeted 17%, marking its lowest point since October and shaving billions off the fortunes of its investors. CEO Jensen Huang alone lost $21 billion from his net worth. Broadcom, another major player in AI chips, saw its shares fall 17.4%, while Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta faced declines ranging from 2% to 4%. Even power utility firms like Vistra and Constellation Energy, which are critical to the data center infrastructure powering AI, saw their stocks fall by 28.3% and 20.8%, respectively.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3%, dragging down the broader S&P 500 tech sector, which fell 5.6%. This was the sector’s worst one-day decline in over four years. By the end of the day, the global market had shed a staggering $1 trillion in value, a sharp reversal of the AI-driven gains that had propelled stocks to record highs over the past two years.DeepSeek, once an obscure startup, emerged as a serious player in the global AI race last week when it announced the release of its R1 model. According to the company, the R1 model can match the performance of OpenAI’s GPT-4 and other leading models while costing just $5.6 million to develop—a fraction of the hundreds of millions or even billions spent by U.S. firms. The company also claimed to have achieved this feat using Nvidia’s less powerful H800 chips, a move born of necessity due to U.S. export restrictions on more advanced GPUs like the H100.The timing of DeepSeek’s announcement could not have been more significant. Its AI chatbot, integrated with the R1 model, quickly became the most downloaded app on Apple’s US App Store, overtaking OpenAI’s ChatGPT. For Silicon Valley, the implications were clear: China had found a way to compete in the high-stakes AI game without the massive capital investments and infrastructure traditionally required.Despite the dramatic market response, not everyone is convinced of DeepSeek’s claims. Analysts like Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein and Atif Malik of Citigroup have questioned whether the R1 model can truly rival US counterparts at such a low cost. They pointed out that while DeepSeek may have used less advanced hardware, its ability to achieve cutting-edge performance without significant investments in GPUs remains debatable.There are also suspicions about how DeepSeek obtained its hardware. Elon Musk, who has heavily invested in Nvidia chips for his company xAI, speculated that DeepSeek may have acquired banned H100 chips through indirect channels. Alexandr Wang, CEO of Scale AI, echoed this sentiment, claiming that Chinese firms “have more H100s than people think.” Nvidia, however, stated that DeepSeek’s technology was “fully export control compliant.”The broader implications of DeepSeek’s rise are significant for U.S. tech companies. For years, firms like Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI have built their dominance on the premise that AI requires immense capital expenditure. Nvidia, for instance, has sold billions of dollars’ worth of high-end GPUs, becoming a linchpin of the AI revolution. But if DeepSeek’s claims hold, the demand for such hardware could decline, undermining the economic model that has driven the industry’s explosive growth.Nevertheless, some industry leaders see opportunity in DeepSeek’s innovation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the R1 model “an impressive competitor” and pledged to accelerate his company’s product releases. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella argued that cheaper AI would democratize access and drive broader adoption, potentially benefiting the global economy.DeepSeek’s announcement has forced a reevaluation of the economics of AI. For years, the development of large language models (LLMs) has been characterized by ballooning costs and resource-intensive processes. OpenAI’s GPT-4 reportedly cost over $100 million to train, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei suggested that some models are approaching $1 billion in development costs.In contrast, DeepSeek has demonstrated that advanced AI can be developed at a fraction of the cost, potentially reshaping how companies approach AI investments. This shift could benefit smaller players and startups, but it also raises questions about the billions already spent by Silicon Valley giants on data centers and infrastructure.DeepSeek’s success has broader geopolitical ramifications. The US has sought to curb China’s AI development through export controls and sanctions, limiting access to cutting-edge chips and technology. However, DeepSeek’s achievements suggest that these measures have not only failed but may have spurred innovation. By focusing on efficiency and resourcefulness, Chinese firms like DeepSeek are proving that they can compete with—and possibly surpass—their US counterparts.President Trump’s administration may now face pressure to tighten export restrictions further, a move that could escalate tensions with Beijing. At the same time, policymakers will need to consider how to foster innovation at home while maintaining a competitive edge.For investors, Monday’s selloff serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with overexposure to a single narrative. The AI boom, while transformative, has also fueled speculative behavior, with tech stocks reaching valuations that some argue are unsustainable. Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro, urged caution, noting that “panicking rarely makes for a good investment decision.”Yet, others see a silver lining. Lower costs could make AI more accessible, driving widespread adoption across industries and fueling long-term economic growth. As Joseph Amato of Neuberger Berman put it, “If you can invest less for a powerful model that has wider adoption, that’s got to be a good thing for the broad-based economy.”(With inputs from agencies)","A Chinese startup called DeepSeek announced a breakthrough in AI technology that threatens to upend the economics of the industry.

The Chinese artificial intelligence app has soared to the No. 1 spot in Apple's App Store productivity category across major markets including the US, UK, China and India, overtaking ChatGPT and other rivals in the generative AI space.In Google Play in India, DeepSeek was only at No. 26 and ChatGPT at No. 4 in the productivity category, but this could change in the coming days with the attention it is receiving.Among DeepSeek’s rivals building large language models (LLMs), Perplexity founder & CEO Aravind Srinivas was the only one to make a public comment on the Chinese company’s accomplishment. He congratulated DeepSeek, and noted on X: “For a while, it wasn't clear who would beat ChatGPT for the first time. The best we (Perplexity) could manage was #8, a year ago. Look forward to using all their (DeepSeek’s) models for search, assistant, and agents this year.”Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made an indirect reference to it. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, he said, ""We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.""DeepSeek is founded by Liang Wenfeng, who previously founded a hedge fund. What makes its achievement noteworthy has been its ability to make a ChatGPT-class language model at a fraction of ChatGPT’s cost. DeepSeek’s R1 AI model is said to match or even beat the likes of ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini on multiple parameters. What’s more, it’s free, unlike ChatGPT that has a very limited free version.Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the marquee venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and an advisor to US President Donald Trump, described DeepSeek’s accomplishment as “AI’s Sputnik moment,” making a reference to a period of anxiety among Western nations about a possible technological gap between the US and the Soviet Union when the latter launched the Sputnik satellite. Social media platform X was abuzz with DeepSeek around this. While some took potshots at companies such as OpenAI, which was founded 10 years ago, raised about $17.9 billion in funding, and has an employee base of thousands, others cast doubts on DeepSeek’s claims of spending less than $6 million to build R1.US venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya said: “We need to get better at taking huge shots on goal and allocating capital to the best of these ideas. I worry that in this current melee, we’ve overspent billions on dumb features which these next-gen models will roll over in the next 12 months or earlier. Lots of capital losses are coming.” Garry Tan, CEO of famed Silicon Valley-based startup accelerator Y Combinator, said DeepSeek’s search feels more sticky even after a few queries “because seeing the reasoning, even how earnest it is about what it knows and what it might not know, increases user trust by quite a lot.”Vaibhav Domkundwar, founder & CEO of Better Capital, told TOI that R1 is significant because it changes the game entirely. “It is not about proving what its real cost is… we will know a lot more in the coming days, but it will disprove a lot of the narrative pushed by OpenAI and others,” he said.","DeepSeek has soared to the No. 1 spot in Apple's App Store productivity category across major markets including the US, UK, China and India.

The world’s 500 richest people, led by Nvidia Corp . co-founder Jensen Huang, lost a combined $108 billion on Monday as a tech-led selloff tied to Chinese AI developer DeepSeek sent major indices plunging.Billionaires whose fortunes are linked to artificial intelligence were the biggest losers: Huang saw his fortune fall $20.1 billion, a 20% drop, while Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison ’s $22.6 billion loss was larger in absolute terms, but represented just 12% of his fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Dell Inc.’s Michael Dell lost $13 billion, and Binance Holdings Ltd. co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao shaved $12.1 billion.Tech-sector titans as a group saw $94 billion of wealth evaporate — roughly 85% of the Bloomberg index’s total decline. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.1%, and the S&P 500 dropped 1.5%.Hangzhou-based DeepSeek has been developing AI models since 2023, but the company first came onto the radar of many Western investors this weekend as its free DeepSeek R1 chatbot app topped download charts worldwide. So many new users piled in that DeepSeek struggled to keep the app online, suffering outages and forcing it to restrict signups to users with Chinese phone numbers.DeepSeek’s dark-horse entry into the AI race, which it says cost just $5.6 million to develop, is a challenge to Silicon Valley’s narrative that massive capital spending is essential to developing the strongest models. That delivered a serious blow to billionaires whose fortunes are tied to the Western AI supply chain that’s been the equities market’s biggest driver over the past two years.Also Read | 'Sputnik moment': Chinese DeepSeek wipes off $1 trillion from US tech giants in a day Soaring valuations for so-called AI hyperscalers — including Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — have generated billions in wealth for their owners since OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in November 2022. These companies have for the most part operated on a similar playbook: Spend huge sums to develop and run AI systems by hoarding top-of-the-line semiconductors and the energy supplies needed to run them.Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced Friday that the company planned to spend $60 billion to $65 billion on projects related to AI this year, well above Wall Street estimates. Capital spending across all Big Tech firms is on pace to reach $200 billion in 2025, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report.Despite limited revenue to show for all their investment so far, markets have rewarded US tech stocks with record-high valuations, which have in turn generated historic wealth gains for their owners. Nvidia has stood out as the AI boom’s biggest single winner so far, with Huang’s net worth increasing almost eight-fold to $121 billion since the start of 2023 through Friday. Zuckerberg’s fortune soared 385% to $229 billion over the same period and Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos gained 133% to $254 billion.While Huang and Ellison suffered losses, other major tech billionaires’ fortunes escaped unscathed. Zuckerberg’s net worth ended the day up, gaining $4.3 billion as Meta rebounded from an early-session decline. Bezos’ wealth climbed by about $632 million.The fact that DeepSeek was able to develop a free model that potentially rivals or beats competitors including ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude at a fraction of the development cost led investors to question the logic behind Silicon Valley’s dependence on capital spending.A key reason why DeepSeek didn’t rely on big investment and top-of-the-line chips to develop its model is that Chinese firms have had limited access to the powerful GPUs, or graphics processing units, most Western companies rely on ever since the US government instituted strict export controls on the most advanced chips.In an interview with CNBC last week, Alexandr Wang, CEO of training data provider Scale AI, said that despite the export controls, DeepSeek and other Chinese developers likely have more GPUs than Silicon Valley is aware of.“The Chinese labs have more H100s than people think,” Wang said, referring to Nvidia’s top-of-the-line AI chip. “My understanding is that DeepSeek has about 50,000 H100s, which they can’t talk about, obviously, because it’s against the export controls that the US has in place.”",The world’s 500 richest people lost a combined $108 billion on Monday as a tech- led selloff tied to Chinese AI developer DeepSeek sent major indices plunging.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

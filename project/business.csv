Trump Blocks India’s Crucial Chabahar Plan With Sanctions; $120M Investment In Iran At Risk

Chabahar port sanctions: What is the latest move from US?

What do sanctions on Chabahar port mean for India?

Why is Chabahar port important for India?





At a time when India and the US are looking to seal a trade deal, the Donald Trump administration has dealt a fresh blow to India’s trade and strategic ambitions by removing sanctions waivers from Chabahar port Since 2018, India has been operating the Shahid Beheshti terminal at Chabahar, enabling New Delhi to establish trade routes and deliver humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and Central Asian nations while circumventing Pakistan.The withdrawal of exemptions was anticipated for months following Trump's executive order in January. The State Department and Treasury Department officially announced the decision earlier this week, citing their strategy of ""maximum pressure on Iran"" due to its alleged ""support to regional terrorist proxies and advance weapons systems that pose a direct threat to US forces and our allies.""The Secretary of State has withdrawn the sanctions exemption granted in 2018 under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act (IFCA) for Afghanistan's reconstruction and economic development, aligning with President Trump's stringent policy to isolate Iran. This revocation takes effect from September 29, 2025. The State Department announced that following this revocation, individuals operating the Chabahar Port or participating in IFCA-related activities could face sanctions.This decision directly impacts India's state-operated India Ports Global Limited (IPGL), which has managed the Shahid Beheshti terminal at the port since 2018. The initial waiver was provided by the Trump administration under IFCA, recognising the port's significance for Afghanistan's reconstruction and economic growth.The removal of the waiver represents an unexpected setback from the United States for India, as Chabahar functioned as a strategic counter to Chinese regional dominance, particularly in relation to the China-supported Gwadar Port in Pakistan. These ports are positioned merely 170 kms apart.Chabahar was essential not only for delivering humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, which Pakistan had obstructed, but also functioned as a crucial centre for the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). This multi-modal transport initiative aimed to establish connections between India, Iran, Russia, and Central Asia.In ancient times, before Pakistan's establishment as a nation-state, the renowned historian Al-Biruni documented in the Tarikh Al-Hind that India's coastal boundary began at Tiz, which is now known as Chabahar. The name Chabahar translates to ""four springs,"" referring to the area's favourable weather conditions.In 2024, India signed a 10-year pact to operate the strategically vital Chabahar port in Iran, aiming to boost trade with Central Asia. Positioned on the Gulf of Oman and initially conceived by New Delhi in 2003, the port functions as an important transit point for Indian products seeking entry into Afghanistan and Central Asia.This connection will utilize the International North-South Transport Corridor’s road and rail links, allowing India to circumvent Pakistan. India's role in developing Chabahar is frequently viewed as a strategic response to Pakistan's operations at Gwadar port and China's Belt and Road Initiative.On May 13, 2024, Indian Ports Global Limited (IPGL) signed a long-term contract with Iran's Port & Maritime Organization. IPGL plans to contribute about $120 million, complemented by an additional $250 million obtained through debt funding. This agreement, set for a period of 10 years and featuring automatic renewal clauses, replaces the earlier contract.India's contributions feature infrastructure investments—such as expanding road and rail systems—and the possibility for India to become a key destination for Iranian exportsUnder the arrangement, India gains operational authority over the Chabahar port as a result of its financial commitment to port development. This marks the first time India will manage a foreign port.Adjacent to both the Strait of Hormuz and the Indian Ocean, Chabahar offers important strategic advantages.The Kandla port in Gujarat is the closest Indian port to Chabahar, situated 550 nautical miles away, whereas the distance between Chabahar and Mumbai measures 786 nautical miles.Several Central Asian nations, including resource-rich but landlocked countries such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, have shown strong interest in using Chabahar to secure access to the Indian Ocean Region and the Indian market.","In 2024, India signed a 10-year pact to operate the strategically vital Chabahar port in Iran.

What did the preliminary investigation reveal?

What the maintenance records reveal?



What are fuel control switches?







The families of four victims of the June 12 crash of Air India Flight AI171 have filed a lawsuit against US planemaker Boeing and aerospace supplier Honeywell, alleging that faulty cockpit fuel switches caused the deadly accident that killed 260 people.The complaint, lodged in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, claims the accident occurred seconds after the Boeing 787 Dreamliner took off from Ahmedabad for London due to a defective design of the aircraft’s fuel cutoff switches.Honeywell manufactured the switches, which were approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). While the FAA has said the switches themselves do not appear to have caused the crash, the lawsuit contends that their design and placement made them prone to accidental activation.The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages on behalf of the families of Kantaben Dhirubhai Paghadal, Naavya Chirag Paghadal, Kuberbhai Patel, and Babiben Patel—among the victims who perished in the crash, Reuters reported.According to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the Dreamliner took off normally before both of its engines lost power.A cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other, “Why did you shut off the fuel?” to which the co-pilot responded, “I did not.”Investigators found that the fuel switches had been flipped to “CUTOFF,” cutting power to both engines. Though the crew reset them to “RUN” within 14 seconds, triggering an automatic engine relight—the aircraft had already lost critical thrust.The plane entered a steep descent, crashing into a nearby building just 32 seconds after takeoff. CCTV footage confirmed the deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT), a backup power source used during complete engine failure. The AAIB report also ruled out bird strikes, noting no evidence of avian activity in the area.Of the 229 passengers, 12 crew members, and people on the ground, only one passenger survived.The preliminary investigation indicated that Air India had not carried out all suggested inspections for the aircraft model. Maintenance records revealed that the throttle control module, which houses the fuel switches, was replaced in 2019 and 2023 on the ill-fated plane.However, the AAIB noted that “all applicable airworthiness directives and alert service bulletins were complied with on the aircraft as well as engines,” suggesting regulatory requirements had been met.Despite this, the lawsuit argues that the switches’ location just below the thrust levers “effectively guaranteed that normal cockpit activity could result in inadvertent fuel cutoff.”Aviation safety experts, however, told Reuters that the switches’ design makes accidental activation highly unlikely.Legal analysts note that while most aviation accidents result from multiple factors, lawsuits against manufacturers are common because airlines enjoy liability caps that aircraft makers do not, according to Reuters.Fuel control switches regulate the flow of fuel to an aircraft’s engines. They are essential during engine start-up, shutdown, and in-flight emergencies. On the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, the switches are placed below the thrust levers.If moved to “CUTOFF,” the switches immediately cut power to the engines. Aviation engineers stress they are designed to resist accidental activation.However, once flipped, their impact is immediate, leaving little room for recovery, as tragically demonstrated in the Air India crash.",The families of four victims of the June 12 crash of Air India Flight AI171 have filed a lawsuit against US planemaker Boeing and aerospace supplier Honeywell.

'Forget Free Trade Pact': Top EU Diplomat Sounds Warning To India Amid Trump Tariff War

EU to phase out Russia LNG imports?





Looking to pressurise Russia, the European Union is now looking to hasten its phaseout of Russian liquefied natural gas imports. The new plan aims to stop imports of Russia’s LNG ahead of its original 2027 deadline, following recent calls from US President Donald Trump for stronger measures to limit Moscow's energy trade.The Trump administration has been pushing European allies to accelerate their reduction of Russian fuel imports. Additionally, the US has been advocating for imposing substantial tariffs of up to 100% on India and China for their continued purchases of Russian oil.The EU's initial timeline had set the end of 2027 as the target date for completely eliminating Russian LNG imports, but the new measures could significantly advance this deadline.According to a Bloomberg report, the European Commission is considering including provisions in its upcoming sanctions package to expedite the elimination of Russian LNG imports before the end of 2027. The new sanctions proposal could be announced as early as Friday.The EU is also exploring the possibility of fast-tracking the Russian LNG phaseout through modifications to its RePowerEU plan, which was established to reduce dependency on Russian energy supplies.""Since we presented the RePowerEU plan in 2022, we've been saying that a phaseout of Russian energy is better sooner rather than later,"" Commission Spokeswoman Anna-Kaisa Itkonen said.The EU is focusing on targeting Russian LNG instead of imposing tariffs on India and China, as many member states remain hesitant about broader sanctions, according to the Bloomberg report.The EU's ability to phase out Russian gas is supported by an expected surplus in the global gas market by late 2024, which could help prevent supply shortages and price spikes in Europe.The United States has expressed strong interest in expanding LNG exports to Europe, with current EU imports from the US standing at approximately 50 billion cubic meters annually. Around twelve EU countries have LNG infrastructure in place.The recently signed EU-US trade deal includes a commitment from the EU to purchase $750 billion worth of US energy over the next three years, with increased LNG imports being a key component.Despite significant reductions in Russian gas flows to Europe following the 2022 Ukraine invasion, Russian supplies through Turkish pipelines and LNG shipments still constitute nearly 19% of total EU imports in 2024.Spain, Belgium, and France currently lead EU nations in Russian LNG imports.The EU's approach includes two distinct pathways. While LNG sanctions require unanimous support from member states, RePowerEU plan proposals only need a qualified majority vote.""Spanish companies have increased substantially our purchases of LNG from the US, so somehow we're getting away from Russia,"" Spanish Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo told Bloomberg Television. ""It's good that we have a specific calendar, and if we can push ahead more rapidly, then that's good news as well.""A draft regulation for ending Russian LNG imports by 2027 is under review by the European Parliament and EU Council members, with both bodies able to suggest amendments.The RePowerEU measures would implement permanent changes, unlike sanctions package measures which could be reversed if sanctions on Russia are lifted.""Europe has made huge efforts and been very successful in reducing our reliance on Russian energy and Russian gas,"" Paschal Donohoe, who leads the meetings of euro-area finance chiefs, told Bloomberg Television. ""The Commission have indicated that they want to bring forward the proposal to further accelerate the reduced reliance we would have on Russian energy, and I know that efforts will be made to do that.""",The European Union is looking to hasten its phaseout of Russian liquefied natural gas imports.

'We Expect...': India's Big Message To Saudi Arabia After Riyadh's Huge Defence Pact With Pak





DUBAI: After the UAE, government is looking at trade pacts with individual countries in West Asia, instead of the earlier plan for an agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council, commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal said Friday.""The agreement with the UAE has been the most successful trade agreement so far. The one with Oman will be signed soon and the terms of reference with Qatar are being discussed,"" he said. While India and GCC were pursuing a trade agreement, India went ahead and signed the treaty with UAE as the one with the bloc was taking time, possibly due to Saudi Arabia's reluctance. Goyal said that the proposal for an FTA with GCC is not on the table at the moment.In recent months, govt has been pursuing an aggressive agenda on trade agreements, engaging with several countries, ranging from the UK and EU to Peru. Sources said the agreement with Oman is undergoing vetting and translation before being sent for clearances. Companies in UAE have shown significant interest in partnering with Indian players to export to third countries in Africa and central Asia, industry executives said.Goyal added that there has been discussion around more FDI in banking, infrastructure, data centres and technology, logistics and renewable energy.Besides, he suggested that India-UAE initiative for joint investment in third countries is expected to come as a boon for Indian workers as govt is positioning manpower as a key asset, while willing to help Indian private companies source contracts and offer credit lines. On its part, entities from the UAE are expected to chip in with capital for projects in markets, such as Africa and even in regions where there is shortage of housing and infrastructure. Mining and manufacturing are the other pillars of the proposed plan.""UAE is investing in high-tech areas and may look at collaborations in technology sectors. It is a hub to attract investments and India would like to leverage this hub,"" Goyal said.","After the UAE, government is looking at trade pacts with individual countries in West Asia.

This is the third upgrade by a sovereign credit rating agency this year, following S&P's upgrade to 'BBB' (from BBB-) in Aug and Morningstar DBRS' upgrade to 'BBB' (from BBB (low)) in May 2025.R&I said the impact of the tariffs imposed by US on India's economy will be limited. ""The US has raised its tariff rate on India to 50%. While this may pose a risk factor for economic outlook, India's economy is mainly driven by domestic factors and its dependence on exports to the US is not high,"" the ratings agency said in a statement, adding that GST rate reduction, which will kick in from Sept 22, would help minimise the impact.The agency said the economy will maintain the growth rate in mid-6% range from FY26 onwards, backed by population growth, the catch-up effect of income and govt's public investment and economic policy, among other factors.The govt welcomed the decision by the ratings agency. ""Three credit rating upgrades for India in five months reflect increasing global recognition for India's robust and resilient macroeconomic fundamentals and prudent fiscal management and underscore global confidence in India's medium-term growth prospects amid prevailing global uncertainties,"" said an official statement.The rating agency said govt is striving to reduce the fiscal deficit, which narrowed to 4.8% of GDP in FY24. ""While govt has been increasing capital expenditures, it managed to reduce the fiscal deficit, thanks to the tax revenue increase backed by strong domestic demand as well as the cut of subsidies,"" said R&I.","Japanese credit rating agency Rating and Investment Information (R&I) upgrades India's long-term sovereign credit rating to 'BBB+' R&I retained the ""stable"" outlook, citing growth prospects, progress on fiscal consolidation, and reforms undertaken by govt.

NEW DELHI: Apple 's new-gen iPhone17 smartphone had a bumper opening in India with top variants - Pro and Pro Max - getting sold out across many locations as the American giant also grew fastest in first half of the year, ahead of mass brands, such as Vivo, Oppo, and realme.iPhone sales in the Jan-June'25 period grew by 35%, even when overall smartphone market recorded 2% growth (on cumulative volume of 60 million units) in the same period, according to numbers released by research firm IDC.Apple is now the fifth-largest smartphone brand in the country, with a share of 9.7% in total sales. Chinese Vivo led the market with a share of 20%, followed by Korean Samsung (14.7%), Oppo (12.3%), and realme (10.1%), according to IDC. This despite the average selling price (ASP) of iPhone is nearly three times to that of overall ASP of smartphone market.The strong interest for the new iPhone was evident in the early-morning rush across many stores, especially in Mumbai and Delhi. The Mumbai store witnessed some unruly scenes as many shoppers fought each other to get their hands on the latest devices.In Delhi, there were long queues outside the stores of Unicorn, which is also the biggest retailer of the brand in the country.To avoid the rush, the retail giant allowed many customers to pre-book and take deliveries at scheduled times.Navkendar Singh, analyst with IDC Asia Pacific, said as per early estimates, sales of iPhone17 ""had comfortably surpassed"" the opening day numbers recorded for the previous-gen iPhone16. Singh added that iPhone continues to be one of the most aspirational smartphone brand in the country. ""The company's volumes across top cities are also aided by aggressive financing schemes, exchange programmes and easy EMI options. Also, Apple is being led by the marketing and retail expansion of the brand across the country.""Apple CEO Tim Cook has spoken highly about the growth in revenue and sales of the iPhone in India. Speaking to analysts post the company's last quarterly results, Cook had said that revenues in India are witnessing record growth, led by the strong growth in sales of iPhones.IDC numbers showed that Apple and iPhone are not just a phenomenon in the bigger metros but also saw strong traction across smaller towns and cities, as the company expanded its retail stores. Apple was the fifth-largest smartphone brand in northern and southern markets of India, apart from many Tier 1, 2, and 3 cities, IDC said.","iPhone sales in the Jan-June'25 period grew by 35%, even when overall smartphone market recorded 2% growth.

A new Aadhaar-based framework has been rolled out for cooperative banks, paving the way for them to offer authentication and eKYC services that had long remained out of reach due to compliance and cost hurdles.Announcing the initiative at a workshop in New Delhi on Friday, Cooperation Ministry Secretary Ashish Kumar Bhutani said the move will strengthen cooperative banks and enable them to serve rural and semi-urban India more effectively, PTI reported.""This will significantly expand the reach of financial inclusion to rural and semi-urban India, in line with the government's vision of inclusive growth through cooperation,"" Bhutani said, according to an official statement.The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), in consultation with the Ministry of Cooperation, NABARD, NPCI, and cooperative banks, developed the streamlined system that addresses long-standing challenges.Under the revised model, only the 34 state cooperative banks (STCBs) will register directly with UIDAI as Authentication User Agencies (AUAs) and eKYC User Agencies (KUAs). The 351 district central cooperative banks (DCCBs) will use the Aadhaar infrastructure of their respective state cooperative banks, avoiding the need for separate IT systems.UIDAI CEO Bhuvnesh Kumar called the new setup ""a robust and forward-looking mechanism which will greatly facilitate cooperative banks across the country in adopting Aadhaar-enabled authentication and eKYC services.""Nabard Chairman Shaji KV assured full support to cooperative banks in adopting the framework. The workshop was attended by representatives of all STCBs and DCCBs, with over 500 participants joining virtually.Officials said the revised system will cut costs, improve efficiency and expand the reach of Aadhaar-enabled payment and banking services to the last mile.","A new framework has been rolled out for cooperative banks.

Gold Price Outlook

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices Last week saw a blend of inflation trends & political interference which involved Fed independence risk created a wave of uncertainty, boosting safe haven appeal for gold as it continued to hit record highs.In the US, mixed inflation data, cooling labour markets, and weakening consumer sentiment kept expectations of a Fed rate cut in place. In Europe, political instability in France added to economic pressure, while the ECB held rates steady. China grappled with deflationary pressures & Japan prepared for snap elections.Other asset classes included, global equity markets ending the week higher, while US Treasury yields, & the US dollar weakened, while oil prices edged up.Gold recorded repeated all-time highs edging near to $ 3,700 per oz in the current week. Gold ETF investors continued to be heavy buyers continuing their purchase for third consecutive months with net holdings rising steadily. led by Western funds. (YTD Inflows: 472.7 tonnes inflows. Vs 6.8 tonnes outflows in 2024).In India, Gold ETFs recorded inflows of Rs 2,190 crore in August, the largest since January’s Rs. 3,751 crores.Global central banks now own more gold than US Treasuries for the first time since 1996, indicating a substantial shift in their foreign exchange holdings. Gold has already surpassed the euro as the second most important reserve asset after the US dollar. Adjusting for over four decades of inflation the spot price of gold, also surpassed its inflation adjusted peak of $ 850 set on January 21, 1980 which comes to around $3590 per oz.The current week remains most crucial for gold as the US Fed may announce its monetary policy on September 17, midnight. It is widely expected that the central bank may go ahead to slash its interest rates by 25 bps, as a slight possibility of a 50 bp cut also exists. Overall possibility of 3 rate cuts persists by the end of the year. Having said that, a summary of economic projections which includes projections on interest rate cuts to be released by the US Fed during the meeting remains crucial to be assessed for further direction in precious metal prices.Overall, a likely hawkish cut could bring in profit booking moves in prices. However, chances of any major correction lower remains' limited, as the US labour market shows signs of weakening, where major supports lie at around $ 3620 – 3570 zone (CMP $ 3685). On the higher side, prices could turn volatile in the coming session post release of Fed statement as strong upside barriers could persist at around $ 3,720 – 3,750 per oz in spot. This could translate to a level of Rs. 1,12,000 - 1,12,500 // 10 gm on MCX futures contract on a higher side on a weekly basis.","Gold recorded repeated all-time highs edging near to $ 3,700 per oz in the current week.

What is the penalty for filing a belated return?



Can I claim a refund in a belated return?



How to file ITR after the due date?





Can a belated return be revised?







The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Monday extended the income tax return (ITR) filing deadline for individual taxpayers by one day, from September 15 to September 16, 2025 for AY 2025-26.The extension applies to those not required to undergo an income tax audit. This deadline has not been extended further.So, what happens if one misses the deadline?Taxpayers missing the deadline can still file a belated return until December 31, 2025, but it may attract penalties and other consequences.Any ITR filed after the due date is considered a belated return and can be submitted until December 31, 2025. While filing a belated ITR allows taxpayers to comply with the law, it comes with certain limitations, including late fees and other potential consequences.Tax experts advise taxpayers to act promptly and file their ITR by September 16 to avoid unnecessary penalties and complications.Chartered Accountant Hitesh Jain, Partner – Direct Tax, N. A. Shah Associates LLP, explained that under Section 115BAC, effective from Assessment Year 2024-25, the new tax regime is the default option.Jain said, “So if a taxpayer wants to opt for the old regime, then ITR needs to be filed before the due date prescribed under Section 139(1) which is September 15, 2025 for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26).”This means that taxpayers without business income can select the old tax regime only through the original ITR filed on or before the due date. Jain added that deductions such as house rent allowance (HRA), home loan principal and interest under Section 80C, leave travel allowance (LTA), and others cannot be claimed if the ITR is filed after the deadline. In cases where the total tax liability is lower under the old regime, missing the September 15 deadline could lead to a higher effective tax liability.Taxpayers who miss the September 16 deadline for filing their ITR must pay a late fee of up to Rs 5,000. Those with an annual income exceeding Rs 5 lakh will be liable for a Rs 5,000 fee, while individuals earning below Rs 5 lakh will pay Rs 1,000. No late fee is charged for filing a nil belated return.A belated ITR is treated the same as a return filed on or before the original deadline when it comes to refunds. Taxpayers can claim a refund when filing a belated ITR, provided they complete all necessary bank validation and compliance requirements.One has to file an ITR after the due date (belated ITR) by logging into the ITR filing portal and then select the filing section as 139(4). The rest process is the same as filing an original ITR.Belated ITRs can be revised, but only until December 31, 2025. Any revision requests submitted after this date will not be accepted.","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on Monday extended the income tax return (ITR) filing deadline for individual taxpayers by one day, from September 15 to September 16, 2025 for AY 2025-26.

Donald Trump’s $100K H-1B Visa Fee Shocker Sparks Fears Among Indian Tech Workers And US Firms

Trump Gold Card Visa : Residency through a $1 million investment



What the Trump Gold Card looks like?



Trump Corporate Gold Card

Trump Platinum Card Visa



Program funding and implementation



Potential Impacts: Immigration and business







US President Donald Trump on Friday announced the launch of the much-anticipated “Gold Card Visa”, a program designed to attract wealthy individuals and corporations by offering them fast-track US residency in exchange for hefty investments.“They’re going to spend a lot of money to come in,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed the order creating the visa program.“It’s going to raise billions of dollars, billions and billions of dollars, which is going to go to reduce taxes, pay off debt and for other good things,” he added.The program introduces a tiered visa system, including the Gold Card ($1 million) and the upcoming Platinum Card ($5 million), along with a separate Corporate Gold Card for businesses sponsoring employees.The Trump Gold Card is the centerpiece of the new visa scheme. Individuals who wish to apply must pay a non-refundable processing fee (estimated at $15,000) and undergo Department of Homeland Security (DHS) vetting.If approved, applicants must make a $1 million contribution to the US Treasury, which the administration defines as a “gift” to demonstrate that the individual will substantially benefit the country.According to the program’s official website: “The Trump Gold Card is a visa based upon an individual’s ability to provide a substantial benefit to the United States. To apply, an applicant must pay a nonrefundable processing fee. Once an applicant’s processing fee is received, the process for visa adjudication will take place… If approved, an individual must make a gift of $1 million, which has been determined to provide sufficient evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States. ”Trump officials said successful applicants will be granted lawful permanent resident status, equivalent to EB-1 or EB-2 visa classifications, but processed in “record time.”The card itself is styled like a luxury credit card. It features a gold background, Trump’s portrait, the Statue of Liberty, and the US flag, with “Trump Gold Card” stamped on the left.The Platinum Card design has not been revealed yet, but the website encourages applicants to join a waitlist immediately, with applications processed on a first-come, first-served basis.According to the program, the Gold Card grants lawful permanent resident status under the EB-1 or EB-2 visa categories, subject to DHS approval. That would put recipients on a path to US citizenship, though officials have not specified exact timelines for naturalisation.The Corporate Gold Card allows companies to sponsor foreign employees. For each worker sponsored, the business must contribute $2 million after DHS vetting and a processing fee.One feature that may appeal to businesses is flexibility. If a company ends the sponsorship of one employee, it can transfer the original $2 million contribution to another worker without paying the amount again.As the website explains, “The Trump Corporate Gold Card is issued to a corporate sponsor for one or more of the sponsor’s employees. To apply, the corporate sponsor must pay a nonrefundable processing fee per employee. Corporate sponsors may apply for multiple employees at once. A $2 million per employee gift upon completion of the employee’s vetting is evidence that the employee will substantially benefit the United States. The advantage of the Trump Corporate Gold Card is that corporate sponsors may cease sponsoring one employee and use the gift contribution tied to the prior application as a basis for sponsoring a new employee without a new $2 million gift. The Trump Corporate Gold Card is subject to a small annual maintenance fee and a transfer fee.”The program, however, includes annual maintenance fees and transfer charges for each reassignment.The Platinum Card, still pending congressional approval, will target ultra-wealthy individuals willing to invest $5 million. In exchange, recipients can reside in the United States for up to 270 days a year without paying taxes on non-US income.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said he expects approval “later this year,” adding that the Platinum Card could significantly expand America’s ability to attract capital.The administration has marketed this tier as a unique mix of residency, extended stay rights, and tax incentives, making it especially attractive to high-net-worth individuals with global income streams.Trump signed an executive order directing that revenue from the Gold and Platinum Cards be deposited into a “separate fund” at the Treasury, earmarked for commerce promotion and debt reduction.Lutnick added that applicants would face “a much more rigorous vetting than has ever been done before,” and that the program would replace existing EB-1 and EB-2 visas.He said other green card categories would likely be suspended once the Gold Card model is implemented. The administration expects the rollout phase to last less than a month.The announcement signals a dramatic reshaping of US immigration policy. The Gold Card would replace traditional skill-based visas like EB-1 and EB-2, while Trump has also proposed a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas, used by technology firms to hire skilled workers.Tech executives could be divided: while the Gold Card allows for new inflows of capital and workers under corporate sponsorships, the higher cost of H-1B visas could burden companies like Accenture and Cognizant. Shares of both firms dipped on Friday following Trump’s announcement.Immigration experts have also raised doubts about Trump’s claim that up to one million Gold Cards could be sold, pointing out that the pool of individuals able to afford the $1 million buy-in is relatively small.Trump first teased the Gold Card program in February, presenting it as an initiative that could draw global capital, create jobs, and reduce the deficit. On Friday, he reiterated its fiscal impact:Despite skepticism about demand, the Gold Card represents one of Trump’s most sweeping attempts yet to monetise the US immigration system while tying it directly to national revenue goals.","US President Donald Trump on Friday announced the launch of the much-anticipated ‘Gold Card Visa’ The program is designed to attract wealthy individuals and corporations by offering them fast-track US residency in exchange for hefty investments.

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday urged US counterpart Donald Trump not to impose unilateral trade restrictions, as such actions could undo the progress made through several rounds of talks.In a telephonic conversation, the two leaders discussed current ties between the two nations, issues of mutual concern and provided strategic guidance for the stable development of bilateral ties in the next stage.The call was described as pragmatic, positive, and constructive, ANI reported citing Xinhua.Jinping also highlighted the historic bond between the two countries, recalling their joint efforts during World War II.“Not long ago, China held a grand commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, during which descendants of members of the American Flying Tigers were invited to the Tiananmen rostrum to watch the military parade. The Chinese people will never forget the valuable support that the United States and other anti-fascist allies provided to China during the war of resistance.On the basis of remembering the fallen and honoring history, we should cherish peace and open up the future,” Xinhua cited Xi as saying.The Chinese president further stressed that Beijing-Washington relations are of great importance and said the two nations can achieve mutual success, prosperity, and benefits for both nations and the world.He said that both sides must move toward each other and make joint efforts to achieve mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.Recent consultations between the two teams reflected the spirit of equality, respect, and reciprocity, Xinhua reported. China also emphasised the US should avoid unilateral trade-restrictive measures that would jeopardise progress made during these discussions.Regarding TikTok, China restated that it respects companies’ choices, supports market-based business negotiations, and favors solutions that follow Chinese laws while balancing interests. Beijing also expressed hope that the US would offer a fair, open, and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese firms operating in America.Trump, meanwhile, praised China’s recent military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of victory in the war of resistance, calling it truly spectacular.

Trump Demands Crushing NATO Tariffs On China, Beijing Warns ‘sanctions Only Fuel Global Chaos’





US President Donald Trump on Friday called his conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping a ‘productive one’. According to Trump, the call touched upon various aspects such as trade, fentanyl, and the TikTok deal. Trump also said he would meet Xi at the APEC Summit in South Korea.“I just completed a very productive call with President Xi of China. We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal.

Building TomoCredit



From personal pain to public purpose



Kristy Kim’s hacks for building credit



Learn about credit early: “Not many people even know what the definition of credit score is. [It is] your likelihood to pay back [a loan] in the next 12 months. Know your score, even at 18 years old. You might have nothing, or something if your parents added you to their file,"" she told CNBC.

Start small: “Borrow small amounts that you can repay easily. Whether it’s $100 or $1,000, proving you can take and repay a loan builds your history. Start small and early. That’s the best hack,” she said.



Redefining access to credit







Landing a banking job in San Francisco in 2011 straight out of UC Berkeley should’ve been Kristy Kim’s ticket to the American dream. The 22-year-old had just landed a job in investment banking in San Francisco and was eager to find her first apartment. But the process quickly turned into a nightmare as every rental application she submitted was rejected.The reason? She didn’t have a US credit score.“It was a lot of struggle... because, here is me, who studied hard, who worked hard to get a job and make money, and realizing that: ‘Oh, I don’t have a credit score in the US , I am credit invisible — a credit ghost,’” Kim told CNBC Make It.Kim had immigrated from South Korea to the US at the age of 11, without family support. With no one to co-sign her lease, she had to improvise.She went directly to a landlord she found on Craigslist and pitched herself. “I basically said: ‘Hey, I don’t have a credit score, but trust me, I have a job and my boss can vouch for me.’” The landlord agreed, and Kim secured her first apartment.The bigger shock came when Kim tried to buy her first car. Repeatedly denied an auto loan because of her lack of credit history, she again tried to think creatively.This time, she walked into her local Citibank branch and asked the manager to vouch for her based on her salary and savings.But the manager explained the rules: the bank’s lending and banking departments were siloed. No one could intervene.“I requested a meeting with the manager ... Basically, I asked her, can you call the auto loan dealership ... and then tell them that I’m a [trustworthy] person ... You guys can see how much money I make,” said Kim.“But she said that it doesn’t work like that. She is not allowed to vouch for me ... [their] banking department and lending department are separate ... so they cannot communicate with each other,” said Kim. “So that’s my ‘aha’ moment that I realized the system is very archaic.”Frustrated, she borrowed money from her family in Korea and bought a used car outright. But the experience left her determined.“It was a lose-lose for everybody. Lose for the auto dealership, because they couldn’t make the sale. Lose for me [because] I had to spend so much cash. And it’s not so great for [the bank] either, because they couldn’t keep me, their customer, happy,” said Kim.Those setbacks planted the seed for TomoCredit, the fintech startup Kim would later found to help others like her — immigrants, students, and young professionals with little or no credit history.Launched in San Francisco, TomoCredit (short for “tomorrow”) provides products designed for people with “thin” or non-existent credit files. The company’s mission is simple: make it easier for people to build credit without facing the systemic barriers Kim once encountered.“That’s why I started Tomo with full confidence,” she said. “I knew there should be millions of Kristy’s out there who had this bad experience. Somebody had to build this.”TomoCredit has clearly struck a chord. Fintech generated more than $20 million in revenue last year, according to documents reviewed by CNBC.Kim, now 38, says she built TomoCredit for her younger self. “As someone who moved here alone, I didn’t know how important a borrowing history was. I want people, especially immigrants [to] feel empowered, instead of being ashamed, because not having a credit score ... was not something I should be ashamed about. That’s simply because I didn’t know the system,” said Kim.Her message: not having a credit score isn’t a personal failure. It’s the result of a system designed to exclude those without family ties, long borrowing histories, or co-signers.For those starting out, Kim offers two key pieces of advice:Kim’s journey from being a “credit ghost” to building a company that serves others like her reflects a broader truth: millions of people in America still struggle with access to the financial system.TomoCredit’s growth shows both the demand for new solutions and the opportunity for fintech to disrupt entrenched banking practices.For Kim, the mission is deeply personal. “Not having a credit score was never something to be ashamed of. I just didn’t know the system. Now, we’re making sure others don’t have to go through the same struggle.”","Kristy Kim is the co-founder of TomoCredit, a fintech startup that helps people build credit.

Wall Street was on course to close another record-setting week on Friday adding $15 trillion in value, buoyed by optimism that the Federal Reserve will continue to ease interest rates to support the economy.By early afternoon, the S&P 500 was up 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 129 points or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.5%. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks also broke past its previous record from 2021, AP reported.The rally has been fuelled by expectations of further rate cuts after the Fed lowered interest rates for the first time this year on Wednesday. Investors hope easier borrowing conditions will cushion the economy amid slowing job growth and persistent inflation pressures.Corporate action also lent support. FedEx rose 3.2% after reporting stronger-than-expected revenue and profit, helped by its domestic package business. Gold miner Newmont climbed 4.1% after selling its stake in Canada’s Orla Mining for $439 million, extending a stellar year in which its stock has more than doubled as gold prices hit record highs.Gold prices have benefited from the prospect of lower rates, high inflation, and concerns that mounting US and global debt could undermine currency values.Among laggards, homebuilder Lennar dropped 3.9% after posting weaker revenue despite stronger profits. Executive Chairman Stuart Miller cited “the continued pressures of today’s housing market” and said the company had to offer bigger incentives to lure buyers, which weighed on average sales prices.Analysts said easier interest rates could revive housing demand, with mortgage rates already falling in anticipation of the Fed’s rate-cutting campaign. However, they cautioned that the rally in equities may be vulnerable if the Fed does not cut rates as aggressively as markets expect.Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week described the central bank’s task as “precarious,” warning that while inflation remains stubbornly high, the job market is losing steam. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which risk pushing prices higher in the short term, have added further uncertainty.Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, noted that equities could face turbulence as “the economy slows, tariff impacts arrive piecemeal and political uncertainties continue.”Overseas, European markets were mixed while Asia ended on a subdued note. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.6% after the Bank of Japan said it would sell part of its large stock fund holdings while keeping rates steady. Chinese indices closed mixed ahead of a phone call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which Trump later described as “productive.” The two leaders agreed to meet at a regional summit in South Korea at the end of October.In the bond market, Treasury yields were stable. The 10-year yield edged up to 4.13% from 4.11% late Thursday.","The S&P 500 was up 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 129 points and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.5%.

‘Disappointed I came to Canada’: US envoy voices concern over 'anti-American' sentiment; defends Donald Trump’s tariff policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/disappointed-i-came-to-canada-us-envoy-voices-concern-over-anti-american-sentiment-defends-donald-trumps-tariff-policy/articleshow/123994049.cms,"Pete Hoekstra (Image/X@USAmbCanada) and Donald Trump (AP image)





The US ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra has voiced frustration over what he sees as growing anti-American sentiment in the country, including from political leaders, following US President Donald Trump ’s decision to impose tariffs on much of the world.Speaking at a Halifax Chamber of Commerce event on Thursday, Hoekstra said that he was surprised by the negative tone toward the US since taking up his role in April.“I’m disappointed that I came to Canada — a Canada where it is very, very difficult to find Canadians who are passionate about the American-Canadian relationship,” he said.Hoekstra accused Canadian politicians of running campaigns with an “anti-American” tone, saying that attitude has continued.Prime Minister Mark Carney recently said in Parliament that Canada has “the best deal with the US worldwide right now,” which Hoekstra welcomed as a positive sign. But he criticized finance minister François-Philippe Champagne for repeatedly describing the tariff clash as a “war,” as reported by CBC news.Calling that language “a dangerous place to go,” Hoekstra argued that if Canada were truly in a trade war, “the country would know it.”Canada’s steel and aluminum industries have been hit especially hard by US tariffs, with steel exports facing a 50 per cent levy. Statistics Canada data shows Canadian exports to the US have fallen nearly 16% since April, while imports from the US are down 11 per cent.Despite the economic strain, Hoekstra defended Trump’s tariff agenda, saying that Canada’s relative position has improved compared to other countries now facing higher rates.Trump has also continued to threaten annexation, suggesting Canada could avoid tariffs by becoming the “51st state.”The ambassador welcomed Prime Minister Carney’s recent decision to drop retaliatory tariffs on US goods covered by the Canada-US-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA).“It’s number one. It’s like hallelujah,” Hoekstra said, adding that those tariffs “should have never been in place.”The move, he said, sets a better tone for the mandatory five-year CUSMA review, though he warned that American businesses are likely to submit negative feedback during consultations.Hoekstra described the review as a “long, grinding process” that may not conclude before July 2026.Still, he expressed optimism about reaching a broader trade deal, saying he remains in regular contact with President Trump and Canadian officials on multiple issues, including China and Ukraine.","US ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra has voiced frustration over what he sees as growing anti-American sentiment in the country.Hoekstra accused Canadian politicians of running campaigns with an “anti-American’ tone, saying that attitude has continued.

The average rate on a 30-year US mortgage fell again this week, reaching 6.26%, marking the lowest level since early October, amid a decline in long-term Treasury yields and the Federal Reserve’s first rate cut of 2025, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. Last week, the rate was 6.35%, and a year ago it averaged 6.09%.Rates on 15-year fixed mortgages, popular among homeowners refinancing their loans, also eased to 5.41% from 5.5% last week, compared with 5.15% a year ago. Mortgage rates generally track the 10-year Treasury yield, which was 4.12% in midday trading Thursday, up from 4.06% late Wednesday, AP reported.Mortgage rates have steadily declined since late July as expectations grew that the Fed would cut rates for the first time since 2024. On Wednesday, the central bank delivered a quarter-point cut and projected two more reductions this year amid concerns over the US job market.“Mortgage rates have eased into the low 6% range, a shift that should support a modest pickup in home sales in the coming months,” said Jiayi Xu, senior economist with Realtor.com. She added that the broader impact may remain limited, as 81% of homeowners hold mortgages below 6%, reducing incentives to sell or move.The decline in rates has sparked a surge in refinancing, particularly among homeowners who took loans when rates were above 6%. Mortgage applications, including purchases and refinancing, jumped nearly 30% last week compared with the prior week, with refinancing loans accounting for nearly 60% of the total, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.Demand for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) also rose sharply, making up about 13% of all applications — the highest share since 2008. “For consumers, it’s another signal that the cost of borrowing is gradually moving lower,” said Bill Banfield, chief business officer at Rocket Cos.","The average rate on a 30-year US mortgage fell again this week, reaching 6.26%.

Fed rate cut’s gradual effect on home loans

Relief on Credit Card Interest May Take Time

Bank savings not as lucrative

Auto loan rates likely to remain elevated





How does the US Federal Reserve’s decision to cut the benchmark rate by 25 basis points to the 4-4.25% range impact the lives of common people in America? The Federal Reserve establishes the federal funds rate, which governs inter-bank lending practices. Although consumer borrowing rates are not directly tied to this rate, Federal Reserve policy adjustments influence consumer costs for various financial products, including credit cards, vehicle financing, housing loans and other financial services.The Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve announced its first benchmark interest rate reduction in nine months on Wednesday. In the period since the previous reduction, inflation control has become less effective, coupled with a deteriorating employment situation. This combination has created difficulties for Americans, who now face elevated prices alongside employment challenges.The quarter-point reduction, the first since December, has brought the Fed's short-term rate to approximately 4.1%, reduced from 4.3%. The Federal Reserve anticipates implementing two additional rate reductions before the year concludes.The Fed rate cut was already factored into the market, which means it's ""unlikely to make a noticeable difference for most consumers at the time of the announcement,"" explains Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates.""Much of the impact on mortgage rates has already occurred through anticipation alone,"" he told AP. ""(Mortgage) rates have been falling since January and dropped further as weaker-than-expected economic data pointed to a cooling economy.""According to Kates, the decreasing interest rate environment will eventually provide relief to borrowers.""Whether it's a homeowner with a 7% mortgage or a recent graduate hoping to refinance student loans and credit card debt, lower rates can ease the burden on many indebted households by opening opportunities to refinance or consolidate,"" he noted.Credit card interest rates are hovering at an average of 20.13%, and cardholders with substantial debt might need to wait before experiencing the effects of the Federal Reserve's rate reduction. Nevertheless, any decrease in rates is beneficial for consumers.""While the broader impact of a rate reduction on consumers' financial health remains to be fully seen, it could offer some relief from the persistent budgetary pressures driven by inflation,"" said Michele Raneri, vice president and head of US research at credit reporting agency TransUnion, according to the AP report,""These savings could contribute to a reduction in delinquency rates across credit card and unsecured personal loan segments,"" she said.For individuals with significant credit card balances, the most effective strategy remains focusing on reducing high-interest debt. Additionally, they should explore options to transfer balances to cards with lower annual percentage rates or directly discuss accommodations with their credit card providers.According to the AP report, bank customers will soon witness a gradual decline in the attractive interest rates currently available on certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts.Currently, the finest rates available stand at approximately 4% for CDs and 4.6% for high-yield savings accounts.These figures remain advantageous compared to historical patterns and present viable options for individuals seeking returns on readily accessible funds.High-yield savings accounts typically offer substantially higher annual percentage yields compared to conventional savings accounts. Traditional savings accounts presently average 0.38% nationwide.Whilst some accounts might maintain returns of roughly 4% until the end of 2025, according to Ken Tumin, founder of , the Federal Reserve's rate reductions will inevitably affect these products, resulting in reduced average yields.Vehicle loan rates in the US have continued to rise since early 2022, following the Federal Reserve's decision to increase its benchmark interest rate. Analysts suggest that these elevated rates are likely to persist, and even with rate cuts, the relief may be gradual.""If the auto market starts to freeze up and people aren't buying cars, then we may see lending margins start to shrink, but auto loan rates don't move in lockstep with the Fed rate,"" explained Bankrate analyst Stephen Kates.Whilst new vehicle prices have stabilised recently, they continue to maintain historically high levels, without accounting for inflation.Currently, annual percentage rates for automobile loans typically range from 4% to 30%. According to Bankrate's latest weekly assessment, the average interest rate for a 60-month new car loan stands at 7.19%.","The Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve announced its first benchmark interest rate reduction in nine months on Wednesday.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

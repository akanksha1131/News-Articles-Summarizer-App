US-Mexico water treaty





US President Donald Trump reignited tensions with Mexico, threatening to impose a 5% tariff on Mexico over an ongoing water-sharing dispute, accusing the neighbouring country of withholding supplies guaranteed under a decades-old treaty.Posting on his Truth Social account on Monday (local time), Trump said that he will raise duties on Mexican imports once again if the issue is not resolved.""I have authorized documentation to impose a 5% Tariff on Mexico if this water isn't released, IMMEDIATELY,"" he wrote, claiming that restricted water supplies are severely affecting crops and livestock in Texas.The disagreement stems from a 1944 treaty that governs water sharing between the two neighbours. Under the terms of that pact, the United States releases water from the Colorado River while Mexico sends flows from the Rio Grande.Trump says Mexico has fallen behind, stating that the country owes 800,000 acre-feet of water. He insisted that Mexico must ""release 200,000 acre-feet of water before December 31st, and the rest must come soon after,"" adding, ""The longer Mexico takes to release the water, the more our Farmers are hurt.""Trump’s warning was issued on the same day he announced a $12 billion support package for the US agriculture sector, which has been rattled by the consequences of his own trade and tariff policies.This is not the first time Trump has tied economic pressure to the water issue. In April, he previously issued a threat of consequences, after which Mexico moved to send water and said it would “continue fulfilling its commitments under the 1944 treaty.”Currently, Mexican goods face a 25% tariff unless protected by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade deal finalised during Trump’s first term. The United States is preparing to pursue a renegotiation of the agreement in 2026.Last week, Trump met Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney during the 2026 World Cup draw. The future of the USMCA formed part of their discussions, marking the first in-person meeting between Trump and Sheinbaum.","US President Donald Trump threatens to impose a 5% tariff on Mexico over an ongoing water-sharing dispute.

More funding for Pakistan! IMF gives green signal to $1.2 billion tranche; cites ‘macroeconomic stability’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/more-funding-for-pakistan-imf-gives-green-signal-to-1-2-billion-tranche-cites-macroeconomic-stability/articleshow/125858590.cms,"'Tell The World, Expose Pak': Ex-General's Big Advice After Pakistani Leader's Delhi Blast Claim

IMF on Monday approved a disbursement of around $1.2 billion to Pakistan, lifting the country’s total inflows under the Extended Fund Facility and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility to roughly $3.3 billion. The IMF Executive Board cleared the payment during its meeting in Washington, citing the country’s efforts in macroeconomic reforms.Pakistan remains heavily reliant on external financing. The country narrowly avoided default in 2023, helped by a $7 billion IMF bailout in 2024, and is now one of the Fund’s biggest borrowers after Argentina and Ukraine. It also entered a 10-year, $20 billion financing arrangement with the World Bank in January.IMF deputy managing director Nigel Clarke said that the country’s policy implementation had remained consistent with programme goals, even after floods during the recent monsoon season killed more than 1,000 people by September.The Board further added that the strength of the reform drive had helped maintain financial stability and improve external conditions despite the shock.Clarke said ""the implementation of reforms in Pakistan has helped to preserve macroeconomic stability despite recent shocks"".Pointing to summer floods in the country, the IMF said, ""the authorities' commitment to meeting their primary balance target while providing the necessary emergency assistance in response to these severe floods is an important signal of their willingness to strengthen their credibility in fiscal policy"".As part of the review, the Fund highlighted Pakistan’s fiscal performance, noting a primary surplus of 1.3% of GDP in FY25, in line with programme expectations. The IMF reported that gross reserves reached $14.5 billion at the end of FY25, compared with $9.4 billion a year earlier, and are forecast to expand through FY26 and beyond, the Dawn reported. The Board acknowledged that inflation had risen due to flood-driven food price spikes but described the pressure as temporary.Clarke warned that a sustained reform effort would be necessary to secure medium-term growth that is led by the private sector. He emphasised the need “advancing reforms to raise revenues via tax policy simplification and base broadening”, noting that fiscal resilience is essential for investments in climate adaptation, social protection, human development and public infrastructure.He further underlined the energy sector as a priority, stating that “reforms in the energy sector are critical to safeguarding its viability and improving Pakistan’s competitiveness”, and that while power tariff adjustments had “helped reduce the stock and flow of circular debt”, subsequent steps must focus on lowering electricity production and distribution costs and addressing inefficiencies in both the power and gas sectors.The climate-related RSF tranche is aimed at supporting Pakistan’s wider resilience and disaster-preparedness framework. Clarke said it backs work to “strengthen natural disaster response and financing coordination, improve the use of scarce water resources, raise climate considerations in project selection and budgeting, and improve the information on climate-related risks in financing decisions”. The Board said the scale of the recent floods demonstrates why climate reforms must be accelerated, and reported that Pakistan is making progress on these fronts with RSF support, the Dawn reported.The IMF noted the publication of the Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment, describing it as “a welcome step in accelerating governance reforms”.","IMF on Monday approved a disbursement of around $1.2 billion to Pakistan.

Gold prices are expected to be driven by US Federal Reserve’s policy decision and comments by the Fed Chair, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. He shares his views and recommendations for gold investors:Gold traded near multi-week highs through last week as expectations of a Fed rate cut continued to firm, supported by dovish commentary from policymakers and a series of weak US data releases. Markets are now pricing an 85–90% probability of a 25 bps cut, reinforced by the unexpected 32,000 drop in November’s ADP private-sector jobs—the steepest hiring slowdown since 2023 and the third decline in four months. SofterTreasury yields and a mild geopolitical risk premium after inconclusive US-Russia discussions on the Ukraine conflict added further support, though some profit-booking emerged amidst the in-line with expected PCE inflation report and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks. Central bank buying and steady ETF inflows also aided sentiment, even as physical demand in India and China eased with buyers waiting for a correction.Silver, which rose 3.3% a few days ago, saw some early-week profit-taking but remains underpinned by tightening inventories in London and China and a structural deficit expected to persist into 2026. Strong industrial demand, sustained safe-haven flows, and highest weekly ETF inflows since July further reinforced bullish momentum.Overall, precious metals traded firm as markets increasingly priced in imminent Fed easing heading into the final policy meeting of the year.This week focus will be on the last Fed policy meeting, factory orders and few other important data points.However, the market will be cautious till the Fed meeting as along with interest rate change, Governor Powell's speech and projections could trigger further action in bullion.","Gold prices expected to be driven by US Federal Reserve’s policy decision and comments by the Fed Chair, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

Even when the Nifty set a new record, 320 stocks in NSE 500 were trading below their peaks leaving the retail investors with portfolios dominated by mid and small caps unhappy. ”“Consequently we are seeing further selling in the mid and smallcaps pushing their prices down, while the strong largecaps which led this rally are remaining resilient.Briefly, what we are witnessing now is fundamentals exerting influence on the market. Overvalued stocks in the mid and smallcap segments are getting dumped impacting their share prices. There is some more time for this trend to play out.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday raised concerns about the recent Hollywood deal that shook up the media landscape, Netflix acquisition of Warner Bros. The US president, speaking to the media while arriving for the Kennedy Center Honors awards ceremony on Sunday, said that the proposed multi-billion-dollar acquisition raised concerns about market dominance.The streaming service, he argued, already commands significant power in the sector. Netflix has “a very large market share” and “it could be a problem.” He further hinted that the White House would be tied to deal, “I’ll be involved in that decision.”These remarks come as federal authorities weigh whether the nearly $83 billion deal should be allowed to proceed amid pushback from within Hollywood, where the prospect of further consolidation has triggered antitrust concerns.Despite the caution, Trump offered warm words for Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, who met him at the White House recently, saying “he's done one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.”The takeover would hand Netflix control of HBO Max in addition to Warner Bros. studios, the home of titles ranging from “Casablanca” and “Citizen Kane” to recent box-office juggernaut “Barbie.”In case the agreement stands as proposed, the streaming platform would also take possession of world-famous franchises including Harry Potter, the Lord of the Rings saga and DC Studios’ superheroes: Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman among them.However, the deal excludes Warner Bros.’ linear television channels. Discovery, CNN and other broadcast properties would be separated from the company before any sale is finalised.Warner Bros. Discovery announced in October that it was open to a sale after fielding multiple unsought bids. Netflix emerged ahead of rival interest from Comcast and from Paramount Skydance, the media business led by David Ellison, a figure known to be a major supporter of Trump.","US President Donald Trump raised concerns about the recent Hollywood deal that shook up the media landscape, Netflix acquisition of Warner Bros.

"Musk’s Starlink lists premium satcom prices for India, then pulls them back saying 'glitch' made 'dummy test data' visible",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/musks-starlink-lists-premium-satcom-prices-for-india-then-pulls-them-back-saying-glitch-made-dummy-test-data-visible/articleshow/125856985.cms,"Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India

NEW DELHI: Elon Musk’s Starlink on Monday announced inaugural prices for its satellite venture in India and, as expected, these were many times more than a regular high-speed broadband connection that is currently being provided by terrestrial providers such as Airtel and Reliance Jio.The company put a Rs 8,600 monthly tariff for its satcom services in India, with a hefty additional Rs 34,000 as one-time charge for the requisite hardware.However, as its premium pricing started to create hectic chatter on social media, especially when it’s still some time before it can launch services as the govt continues work on satcom spectrum allocation and its charges, the company withdrew the announcement from its website, blaming a “glitch” for making “dummy test data visible.“The Starlink India website is not live, service pricing for customers in India has not yet been announced, and we are not taking orders from customers in India. There was a config glitch that briefly made dummy test data visible, but those numbers do not reflect what the cost of Starlink service will be in India,” Lauren Dreyer, VP of Starlink Business Operations, said on X. “The glitch was quickly fixed. We're eager to connect the people of India with Starlink's high-speed internet, and our teams are focused on obtaining final government approvals to turn service (and the website) on,” she said.Earlier in the day, the company said its India services will “work in all weather” with an “over 99.9% uptime”. It promised that the services are easy to initiate. “Just plug in and start using,” the company said, while promising to provide “unlimited data” and a 30-day trial period.However, the prices – if true – would be a far cry to the dirt-cheap tariffs that Indian internet consumers are used to.On mobile phones, the price per GB of data is less than Rs 10, and monthly packages are under Rs 400 for unlimited 5G mobile data, for example on Airtel. For home broadband on optical fibre, the Sunil Mittal-led company charges just Rs 499 per for a connection which comes with a speed of 40MBPS. Not only this, at Rs 599 per month, they also offer 29 OTT streaming services. The installation charges for home broadband are just Rs 1,500 on Airtel, which itself is an advance payment and can be adjusted in future payments.On the other hand, Reliance Jio’s up to 30 MBPS speed entry-level plan for home broadband costs Rs 399 (excluding GST), with a one-time installation charge of Rs 2,500 (of which Rs 1,500 is refundable security).For Starlink, these are early days and despite giving out the consumer prices (though withdrawn now), the company is not in a position to talk about when it will begin services. This is because there is still no clarity on when the spectrum for satellite communications will be provided by the govt.There are currently discussions, and differences of opinion, between regulator Trai and the department of telecom (DoT) — the nodal ministry on communications matters — regarding the charges that satcom companies need to pay to the govt. Until these issues are resolved, there is no chance of a satcom service beginning consumer services in the country.Starlink, however, is in the process of doing the groundwork for beginning services. It has started hiring in India before services begin commercially while also starting work on setting up the requisite ground infrastructure. Also, it needs to get a final approval from the law-enforcement agencies regarding its infrastructure, including mandated interception and data privacy rules, before beginning any commercial operation.It is believed that while having an aspiration to build its business in India’s urban centres, Starlink will initially find higher takers in rural and mobile unserved areas, apart from specialised use cases in strategic areas such as defence, mining, maritime, and enterprises.","The company put a Rs 8,600 monthly tariff for its satcom services in India, with a hefty additional Rs 34,000 as one-time charge for the requisite hardware.

Trump Warns India On Rice Dumping As US Farmers Demand Action Against Cheap Imports

India-US trade frictions





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signalled a fresh flashpoint with India questioning why New Delhi is “allowed” to send large volumes of rice to the United States without facing additional duties, indicating that new tariffs could be on the table as trade talks struggle to advance.The remarks came during a White House meeting where Trump launched a $12-billion support package for American farmers, a core constituency that has been pressing him to counter rising imports.In an exchange with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trump asked, “Why is India allowed to do that (‘dumping rice into the US’)? They have to pay tariffs. Do they have an exemption on rice?” When Bessent replied, “No, sir. We’re still working on their trade deal…”, Trump was firm. “They should not be dumping (rice)… They cannot do that…”Farmers in several states have complained of falling prices and intensified competition from rice-exporting countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand. Trump told them he would “take care” of the issue, insisting, “They shouldn’t be dumping. I mean, I heard that, I heard that from others. You can’t do that.”Trump's comments come as both sides prepare for another round of trade talks in New Delhi on December 10.Trump moved to reassure America’s farm belt with a fresh $12 billion support package, calling it essential relief for growers still dealing with the fallout from recent trade disruptions.He told farmers at the White House roundtable that the payments would offer “much-needed certainty” as they take this year’s harvest to market and plan for the next season. The programme channels $11 billion to row-crop producers through one-time bridge payments, with the remaining funds set aside for other commodities once the details are finalised.Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the payments will be transferred by February 28 and described the package as a stabilising measure until wider benefits from new trade agreements materialise. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent characterised the aid as a “liquidity bridge during a period of adjustment”, arguing that many farmers are still recovering from lost export markets and high production costs. The money will be drawn from the Commodity Credit Corporation and offset by tariff revenue, according to the administration.Trump claimed the sector had been “crushed by the worst inflation in modern history and crippling restrictions on energy, water and countless other necessities”, while again insisting that foreign competitors had long benefited from unfair trading terms. He said he had urged China’s President Xi Jinping to expand soybean purchases beyond commitments already made, adding, “I think he’s going to do more than he promised to do. ”Critics questioned the approach, with Senator Amy Klobuchar saying the simplest way to offer certainty would be to end tariff-driven pressure on farmers.The push for new duties comes against the backdrop of persistent friction in US–India trade ties. Earlier this year, Washington imposed a combined 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods. Negotiations on the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), first proposed in February, aim to raise trade from USD 191 billion to USD 500 billion by 2030, but progress has been slowed by shifting tariff policies and disagreements over market access.Indian officials remain optimistic. Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agarwal recently said New Delhi was “very hopeful” of finalising the first tranche of the agreement within the year. The government has also been assessing the impact of a series of US measures, including reciprocal tariffs under emergency powers and changes to H-1B visa rules that could affect skilled workers.During the address, Trump also said he could target fertiliser coming from Canada, arguing that domestic production must be encouraged. “A lot of it does come in from Canada, and so we’ll end up putting very severe tariffs on that, if we have to, because that’s the way you want to bolster here,” he said. “And we can do it here. We can all do that here.”","US President Donald Trump questioned why India is ""allowed"" to send large volumes of rice to the United States without facing additional duties.

Analysts said that the recent analyst by the company underscored the company’s strategic vision to continue to deliver industry-leading growth towards achieving its goal of 3.2-3.5% of total credit market share and 3.6-4% of retail credit market share (vs 2.8% currently) by FY30. The company aims to improve product penetration among customers by taking product per customer to 6.5-7.5 (vs 6.05 currently), which should drive multiple benefits. These benefits include strong disbursement and assets under management (AUM) growth – midpoint of FY30 guidance implies compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.6% for AUM and 23.9% for net profit over FY26-FY30. This follows a strong delivery over the last 18 years with a 35% AUM CAGR and 48% net profit CAGR. Another benefit is the lower acquisition cost. And lastly a decline in credit costs. However, analysts feel the stock’s rich valuations at current price following the recent upward re-rating could cap upside.Goldman Sachs has a neutral rating on Biocon with the target price at Rs 375. Analysts said that the company announced planned integration with Biocon Biologics, a subsidiary. The company attributed the deal to the following: a simplified corporate structure (including HoldCo discount); Larger balance sheet with improved financial metrics; Operational synergies through consolidation of group resources including commercial and manufacturing infrastructure; and strengthening Biocon’s global position to lead in diabetes, oncology, and immunology.Kotak Institutional Equities initiated its coverage of Tata Capital with an add rating and the target price at 360. Analysts said Tata Capital is India’s third-largest NBFC, with a loan book of Rs 2.44 lakh crore as of Sept-end (Q2FY26). A well-diversified portfolio (with predominant focus on retail, 61% of loan book) and recent footprint expansion will likely drive a 21% CAGR in gross loans over FY25-FY28. Rundown and turnaround of the recently merged TMFL’s loss-making business and improving leverage will drive EPS growth.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Suzlon Energy with the target price at Rs 78. Analysts said that India wind addition is likely to exceed the 2030 target of 100GW. They see a further 20-30GW upside from the commercial and industrial (C&I) segment. They believe the key drivers would be a large under-construction pipeline, increase in intra-state bids and increasing demand from the C&I segment.

Also, Trai did not agree to let go of a Rs 500 per connection charge that it had recommended for satcom consumers in urban areas.DoT had asked Trai to reconsider its recommendation to levy 4% annual spectrum charge, and instead suggested the idea of levying 5% with a provision of 1% discount, if these customers of a company enrolled in a year are from tough terrains in border and remote hilly areas. DoT had also suggested that Trai let go of Rs 500 per customer charge in urban areas if they meet the target of rural connectivity.Trai, however, stuck to its recommendations and did not agree for a review. “The authority does not concur with DoT’s proposal to charge spectrum at of 5% of AGR with conditional discounts for providing connectivity to hard-to-connect areas such as border/ hills/ islands,” Trai said.“… the authority reiterates its recommendations... However, the govt may adopt any additional schemes to take advantage of FSS (fixed satellite services) for faster and economical expansion of broadband services in identified hard-to-connect areas, including but not limited to hills, border areas and islands, particularly addressing affordability of user terminals,” Trai added.Trai said if DoT’s views are adopted to encourage satellite connections in border and tough terrains, then a lot of people in rural areas will be left behind in accessing satellite connectivity.The regulator said because subscribers in urban areas have greater purchasing power — and can generate higher demand and data consumption — NGSO (Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit)-based FSS providers may concentrate services in cities. This, it said, has potential to undermine efforts to bridge the digital divide in rural and remote regions. “Imposing a per subscriber charge of Rs 500 per annum in urban areas, while exempting rural and remote areas, may provide an incentive for operators to expand their services into rural and remote areas,” Trai said.","Telecom regulator Trai and the department of telecom (DoT) are at loggerheads over fixation of satcom spectrum charges for the companies.

China's Goods Trade Surplus Tops $1 Trillion

Why it matters

Zoom in

Here’s how China’s $1.08 trillion trade surplus was built:

Diversified markets

Exports to Africa rose 42%, to Europe 15%, and to Latin America by double digits.

US-bound shipments fell 29% year-over-year in November, marking the eighth straight month of double-digit declines.

But sales to France, Germany and Italy boomed - all reporting double-digit growth.

Places buying more from China

Manufacturing shifts:

Places buying less from China

Currency advantage

The renminbi has weakened significantly, particularly against the euro, making Chinese goods even cheaper abroad.

Prices in China are falling, while those in the US and Europe are rising - supercharging competitiveness.

Between the lines

Exports of toys, electronics, and plastic goods to the US are down, but the loss has been overcompensated by booming sales elsewhere.

China is intentionally selling at low margins to emerging markets to gain long-term geopolitical and economic influence.

The big picture

China is now the world’s largest producer of electric vehicles, batteries, solar panels, and consumer electronics.

In many African countries, Chinese vehicles and tech - once nearly absent - now dominate markets.

Sales of Chinese-made EVs and solar panels to Nigeria and Algeria have multiplied, disrupting local industries.

China's exports rebound in November

“China’s trade surplus in factory goods is even bigger... than the US after World War II,” notes the New York Times.

What they’re saying

What’s next

(With inputs from agencies)

Despite nearly a decade of US tariffs under President Donald Trump , China’s trade surplus has exploded, hitting $1.08 trillion through November - the highest ever recorded globally and a level China didn’t reach until year-end just last year.The record, announced by China’s customs agency this week, represents a 21.7% increase over the same period in 2024 and underscores China’s rising dominance in global exports.President Trump’s trade war strategy - featuring sweeping tariffs, tough rhetoric, and promises to rebuild US manufacturing - has not curtailed China’s export machine.Instead, China has restructured, rerouted, and retooled, pushing more goods into emerging markets, Europe, and Southeast Asia - often by moving final assembly outside its borders to dodge tariff barriers.“Despite persistent trade tensions... we believe China will gain more share in the global goods export market,” said Morgan Stanley’s Chetan Ahya.This surge positions China not only as the world’s dominant supplier of goods but also as a geopolitical force, leveraging exports to build ties - and dependencies - across the Global South.* Chinese companies moved parts of their supply chain to Southeast Asia, Mexico, and Africa, which then export to the US - effectively bypassing Trump-era tariffs.* These “trans-shipping” tactics allowed Chinese firms to continue supplying American retailers while masking origin.“With the renminbi undervalued by 30% against the euro... it will be exceedingly difficult... to compete against Chinese manufacturers,” said Jens Eskelund, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China .Trump’s tariffs, once seen as a bold bid to reshore jobs and production, have created only limited disruption to China’s trajectory.“The margins may not be as high,” Ilaria Mazzocco of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told the NYT. “But for those markets, it's entirely transformational”.Meanwhile, US importers are increasingly turning to India, Vietnam, and Taiwan - but many of those supply chains still begin in China.President Trump’s trade war was meant to reduce America’s reliance on Chinese goods and give US factories a competitive edge.But instead, China has shown it can reorient its export model, reclaim global market share, and sidestep tariff pressure - faster than Washington anticipated.This transformation was no accident. It’s the result of years of top-down industrial planning from Beijing - and decades of underinvestment in manufacturing capacity across the West.Even as President Trump agreed to a one-year trade truce with Xi Jinping in October, his administration continues to weigh additional tariffs, particularly on industries like pharmaceuticals and drones, where China dominates.And while he reduced some tariffs, they still hover at 45% - historically high levels.But critics argue that Trump’s trade war mostly reconfigured supply chains, rather than revitalizing American industry.“November’s stronger-than-expected export growth demonstrates the resilience and competitiveness of China’s exporters,” said David Qu, chief China economist at Bloomberg Economics.“The rebound of export growth in November helps to mitigate the weak domestic demand,” added Zhiwei Zhang of Pinpoint Asset Management.But while exports are thriving, consumer spending at home remains weak, and factory activity has now contracted for eight straight months, raising concerns about the sustainability of export-led growth.The International Monetary Fund is in China this week to assess its currency practices, including whether the renminbi is being kept artificially low to boost exports. A preliminary report is expected Wednesday.At the same time, calls are growing inside China to allow the currency to appreciate - a move that would:“To expand domestic demand, it is necessary to minimize the trade surplus,” said Zhang Jun of Fudan University .As China’s exports flood markets, the EU is considering new anti-dumping measures. Other regions - including India and Brazil - are exploring safeguard tariffs.Despite strong export performance, China’s economy is losing momentum heading into 2026, and export growth may not be enough to offset weak domestic demand.At a recent Politburo meeting, President Xi emphasized domestic demand as China’s top priority for 2026, signaling a longer-term effort to rebalance the economy away from exports .Trump’s tariffs were loud, but China’s strategy was louder.Through currency policy, transshipment, and industrial strength, China has not only survived the trade war - it has thrived, with a record-smashing $1.08 trillion trade surplus to show for it.If the US wants to challenge China’s dominance, it may need more than tariffs. It will require reinvestment, innovation, and allies - and a serious reevaluation of what a ""win"" in global trade even looks like.","Despite nearly a decade of US tariffs under President Donald Trump, China’s trade surplus has exploded, hitting $1.08 trillion through November.

Trump's big claims: US President says tariffs can replace federal income taxes — but do the numbers back him?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-big-claims-us-president-says-tariffs-can-replace-federal-income-taxes-but-do-the-numbers-back-him/articleshow/125832886.cms,"“Tariff Pressure Ended India-Pak Standoff”: Trump Makes Bold Claim

Numbers not numbering

US President Donald Trump is once again floating the idea that tariffs could one day replace federal income taxes in the United States, reviving a proposal that has been the focus of his economic approach since the 2024 presidential campaign.Trump claims that the revenue generated from tariffs is rising fast enough to eventually eliminate the need for Americans to pay income tax, a point he repeated during a Cabinet meeting this week.However, what the US President says stands in sharp contrast to federal revenue data. Treasury figures show that, not tariffs, but individual income taxes are the core pillar of government funding. In the last fiscal year, the government collected about $2.66 trillion from individual income taxes out of a total $5.23 trillion in revenue. Tariffs brought in nearly $195 billion over the same period, representing just 3.7% of the total. Corporate income taxes added approximately $452 billion, AP reported.The first month of the new fiscal year has followed the same pattern. Of the roughly $404 billion generated in that period, $217 billion, or 54%, came from individual income taxes. Tariffs accounted for about $31 billion, or 7.75%, with corporate taxes contributing roughly $15 billion.Experts say that the gap between the two revenue streams makes the proposal unworkable. “It's not possible. It's not feasible mathematically or economically,” said Brandon DeBot, senior attorney adviser and policy director at New York University's Tax Law Center.“And analysts from a range of different perspectives agree with that conclusion. Even the very substantial tariffs imposed this year, which are at the highest levels in the postwar era, raise nowhere near the revenue that income tax does,"" AP cited the attorney.Steve Wamhoff, federal policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, called the idea “nonsensical.”Still, Trump expressed confidence that the government would eventually be able to shift away from income taxes. “And I believe that at some point in the not too distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay. Because the money we're taking in is so great, it's so enormous, that you're not going to have income tax to pay,” he said during Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting.The administration has pointed to an increase in foreign investment pledges as further proof that the tariff strategy is working. “President Trump is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs — whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai, adding that tariffs have triggered “trillions in historic investment commitments to make and hire in America. ” Some of these projected figures, however, have not yet been fully disclosed and have faced questions over accuracy.Tariffs are paid by importers, often American companies, rather than foreign exporters directly. Businesses that face higher import costs frequently raise prices, which means consumers ultimately absorb the increase.Economists argue this is one of several reasons a tariff-only tax system would create disproportionate financial pressure on lower-income households, in contrast with income taxes that can be adjusted to include credits and deductions.The economic implications go beyond households. Higher tariffs risk retaliatory action from trading partners, reduced imports and slower growth, which could reduce, not raise, federal revenue. There is also no guarantee of stability, particularly given periodic shifts in tariff schedules. As Wamhoff put it, “We would be talking about living in a completely different world than the one we live in now. There was a time when the government's finances were provided through tariffs. """"But I believe people were getting around with a horse and buggy back then and not cars. I mean, that was a completely different time,"" Wamhoff further told AP.Trump’s tariff programme is currently before the Supreme Court, and it could be rolled back if justices rule that the president lacks authority to impose the duties. Even if that were to happen, Trump would still have other mechanisms to tax imports, including authorities he relied on during his first term and provisions dating back nearly a century. Several companies, including Costco, have already gone to court seeking refunds for duties they have paid.With the federal income tax in place since the ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913, replacing it would require legislation and a fundamental restructuring of the national budget. For critics, the timing of the idea is questionable. “Inequality is very highly skewed toward the top,” said Michael Graetz, professor of tax law at Yale University. “We've got more billionaires than we've ever had. We've got more millionaires than we've ever had. So it's a strange time to be reducing the tax burden on the top and increasing it on the middle. It's a proposal that is very effective for fundraising for Republicans and it always has been.”Experts also argue that Trump's tariffs also have a fairness issue, as they would, ultimatley, shift the tax burden to low income Americans.","US President Donald Trump is once again floating the idea that tariffs could one day replace federal income taxes in the United States.

Inheritance — from old money to new gen

The world now has more billionaires than ever before, with their combined wealth hitting record high this year!In 2025, the global billionaire club hit an all-time high. UBS counted 2,919 billionaires on April 4– the largest number since the bank began tracking the data in 1995. Their combined wealth reached $15.8 trillion, a 13% jump over 12 months, buoyed by gains in technology stocks.Tech moguls stole the spotlight. Assets held by tech billionaires grew almost a quarter to $3 trillion, thanks to stakes in AI-focused companies like Meta, Oracle, and Nvidia. UBS highlighted six US tech billionaires whose fortunes collectively rose by $171 billion, that’s an average increase of $28.5 billion per person. “This surge is closely tied to their companies’ AI capabilities, from foundational chipmaking to AI-powered cloud infrastructure,” the report said, as cited by CNN.The United States remains the heavyweight home of billionaires with 924 individuals, accounting for nearly a third of the global total. China follows with 470. And 2025 also saw 196 new self-made billionaires, 87 of them from the US, spanning sectors from software and genetics to energy and infrastructure.While their wealth swells, billionaires are far from carefree. UBS surveyed clients between July and September 2025, revealing what keeps the ultra-rich awake at night.Tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and policy uncertainty topped the list.“What billionaires worry about most depends on where they live,” UBS noted. “For instance, 75% of billionaires in Asia-Pacific were concerned about tariffs, while 70% of American billionaires worried about higher inflation or a major geopolitical conflict.”But even as billionaires amass fortunes, a historic transfer of wealth is looming. UBS estimates that around $5.9 trillion will be passed to heirs over the next 15 years. In 2025 alone, 91 heirs inherited a record $297.8 billion – a 36 percent increase from 2024, despite fewer inheritors.“Demographic trends based on the age of the billionaire population suggest that the number of inheritors will continue to rise,” UBS said, as cited by AFP.Western Europe claimed the largest group of inheritors in 2025, with 48 people receiving $149.5 billion. The total was boosted by 15 members of two German pharmaceutical families, aged between 19 and 94. By comparison, North America had 18 heirs inherit $86.5 billion, while 11 individuals in South East Asia received $24.7 billion.Looking ahead, the United States is expected to see the biggest inter-generational wealth transfer, home to a third of the world’s billionaires. UBS predicts that roughly half of the global wealth to be transferred by 2040 will occur in the US, either directly to children or through surviving spouses.Europe will see $1.3 trillion pass to the next generation over 15 years, led by France, Germany, and Switzerland.

For the first time! China trade surplus hits $1 trillion in November; exports to US continue to slide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/for-the-first-time-china-trade-surplus-hits-1-trillion-in-november-exports-to-us-continue-to-slide/articleshow/125829136.cms,"EAM Jaishankar Decodes Massive US China Power Shift And Global Realignment In Sharp Kolkata Address

China ended November with a historic milestone, recording an annual trade surplus of more than $1 trillion for the first time. Official figures released on Monday show that booming exports to markets outside the United States more than compensated for shrinking US demand.The breakthrough came only weeks after Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump negotiated a temporary pause in their long-running trade dispute during a late-October meeting. The truce halted the waves of punitive tariffs and export controls that had shaken global supply chains and prompted tit-for-tat retaliation from both governments.Despite tensions easing, Chinese exports to the United States continued to deteriorate in November. Shipments fell 28.6% to $33.8 billion, yet the overall picture remained positive as orders from other regions lifted total exports by 5.9% compared with the same month last year. The November growth reversed October’s marginal decline and topped Bloomberg’s forecast of 4%.""Weakness in exports to the United States was more than offset by shipments to other markets,"" Zichun Huang of Capital Economics wrote in an analysis, adding that ""exports are likely to remain resilient, thanks to trade rerouting and rising price competitiveness as deflation pushes down China's real effective exchange rate,"" as cited by AFP.With last month’s export surge added to the tally, China’s cumulative trade surplus for the first eleven months reached $1.08 trillion, already exceeding the full-year figure for last year. ""China's trade surplus this year has already surpassed last year's level, and we expect it to widen further next year,"" Huang noted.Beijing’s growing export dominance is likely to heighten friction with Western partners. French President Emmanuel Macron, fresh from a state visit to China, cautioned in an interview with Les Echos that Europe may introduce tariffs if China does not narrow its sizeable trade gap with the European Union. Macron warned that ""Europeans will be forced to take strong measures in the coming months"".The latest data also highlighted ongoing domestic weakness. Imports expanded only 1.9% in November, missing Bloomberg’s prediction of a three percent rise. According to Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, ""The rebound of export growth in November helps to mitigate the weak domestic demand.""He added, ""The economic momentum slowed in the fourth quarter partly driven by the continued weakness in the property sector.""The tariff truce agreed by Xi and Trump expires late next year, giving negotiators a narrow window to turn the temporary arrangement into a more durable agreement. Financial institutions are not convinced stability will hold. ""There's no guarantee this uneasy truce will last that long,"" Lynn Song, ING chief economist for Greater China, said last week. ""A lot needs to go right for the agreement to hold for the full year,"" he wrote, warning that ""it seems prudent to expect a softer external demand backdrop for next year. ""China’s leadership, which has targeted 5% economic growth for 2024, is expected to gather this week for a key meeting on economic strategy.",China recorded annual trade surplus of more than $1 trillion for the first time. booming exports to markets outside the United States more than compensated for shrinking US demand.

Domestic data added to investors’ caution: revised figures released on Monday showed Japan’s economy shrinking at an annual pace of 2.3% during July–September, worse than the previously reported 1.8% contraction.Chinese markets also painted a split picture.

Bottomline

US President Donald Trump has framed his sweeping tariff policy as essential for protecting American workers and manufacturing, promoting it as a cornerstone of his ""America First"" agenda.Since returning to office this year, the Trump administration has overseen a historic surge in tariff collections. According to Fox Business, total duty revenue reached $215.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2025 (ending September 30). October alone brought in a record $34.2 billion. The Treasury also already reported $41.6 billion in tariff revenue in Fiscal Year 2026, and since Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, monthly collections have climbed sharply—from $23.9 billion in May to $29 billion in July, with August and September together adding $62.6 billion.Trump’s logic was– tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, encouraging manufacturers to relocate production to the United States while generating substantial government revenue.However, examination of economic data and analysis from world-leading institutions reveals a fundamental contradiction between Trump's claims and the consequences unfolding in the American economy.At the core of Trump’s tariff strategy is the belief that foreign producers will shoulder most of the cost.But the economic mechanics of tariffs rarely work that way. A tariff is, fundamentally, a tax on imports — and unless foreign exporters aggressively cut prices, which happens only to a limited extent, most of the burden shifts inward. Economists call this tax incidence, the real-world distribution of who ends up paying once markets adjust. In today’s globalised supply chains, where imported components sit inside everything from electronics to machinery, the incidence is overwhelmingly pushed down the chain.That pattern has been evident for months. Even in mid-2025, when the distribution looked slightly different, Americans were still paying the overwhelming share of tariff costs, according to Goldman Sachs.US consumers absorbed about 22 per cent, while American businesses carried roughly 64 per cent, leaving foreign exporters with only 14 per cent. But the burden is projected to tilt even more heavily toward households by year-end.According to the estimates from earlier this year, US consumers are likely to shoulder around 55 per cent of tariff costs, with American companies taking on 22 per cent.Foreign exporters’ contribution rises only modestly to about 18 per cent, reflecting the limited extent to which they cut prices. The remaining 5 per cent falls into routing adjustments and other leakages rather than any identifiable group escaping the tax.The bottomline is– despite political claims that tariffs make foreign producers pay, the economic weight has always landed — and will continue to land — primarily on Americans themselves.The Federal Reserve's real-time analysis of 2025 tariffs provides definitive evidence of how costs flow through the economy.The Federal Reserve Board examined tariffs implemented in February and March 2025 on imports from China and found that tariffs passed through fully and quickly to consumer goods prices within two months of implementation.Their theoretical analysis predicted that a 10 percentage-point tariff increase on imports from China raises consumer prices across a variety of goods categories, with a large share of goods categories experiencing at least a 1 percent price increase following such a tariff change.By August 2025, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis quantified the cumulative effect: tariffs accounted for 0.5 percentage points of headline PCE annualized inflation and 0.4 percentage points of core PCE annualized inflation between June and August 2025. When measured over the 12-month period ending August 2025, tariffs explained 10.9% of headline PCE annual inflation.Former IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath directly addressed Trump's tariff strategy in October, stating that while tariffs have ""significantly boosted government revenue,"" the gains have come ""largely at the expense of domestic firms and households hitting American businesses and consumers."" She noted specifically that tariffs have ""contributed to higher prices, burdening households,"" with costs rising ""in several everyday consumer items"" including ""household appliances, furniture, coffee. ""Yale Budget Lab's comprehensive analysis of all 2025 tariffs found that consumer prices rise 1.2% in the short-run, equivalent to an average per household income loss of approximately $1,700 in 2025 dollars. This price increase represents a transfer of wealth from American consumers and businesses to the federal government through tariff revenue collection.As we talk about who bears the real burden of the tariffs, it's also important to understand the basics of what happens when tariffs are actually imposed as per the rules of economics.This has indeed been the dominant pattern. Yale Budget Lab's July 2025 analysis found that 2025 tariffs disproportionately affect clothing and textiles, with consumers facing 40% higher shoe prices and 36% higher apparel prices in the short-run, with prices remaining 19% and 17% higher in the long-run respectively. The impact is regressive: lower-income households spend larger shares of income on these essentials, meaning tariffs function as a consumption tax that falls heaviest on those least able to absorb price increases.The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge rose to 2.6% in June, up from 2.4% in May, with core inflation rising to 2.8%—directly contradicting claims that tariffs wouldn't raise prices.The San Francisco Federal Reserve's analysis of 40 years of international tariff data found that following tariff increases, the unemployment rate increases by roughly 10 basis points for every 1 percentage point increase in tariff rates. This means that given Trump's tariff increases averaging 20-50 percentage points on major trading partners, unemployment would be expected to rise 0.5-0.6 percentage points—a substantial economic impact.Importantly, the analysis reveals that tariffs act initially as a demand shock—uncertainty causes consumers and businesses to reduce spending, which temporarily suppresses inflation while increasing unemployment. However, this dynamic reverses: ""Over time, the economy adjusts: The unemployment rate returns to its original level or even declines slightly, whereas inflation picks up and peaks three years after the initial change in tariffs, relative to the scenario where tariffs remain unchanged. ""Trump, who has long claimed that tariffs don’t hurt American consumers, ended up acknowledging the opposite — and his latest policy move proves it even further. When Fox News host Laura Ingraham recently pointed out that coffee prices are high, Trump said he would “lower some tariffs” to bring prices down “very quickly.”That admission became reality soon after, when the White House rolled back tariffs on more than 200 food products — including coffee, beef, bananas and orange juice — following rising public frustration over soaring grocery bills. Coffee, which is almost entirely imported, has seen prices jump roughly 15 per cent since January, according to CNN, in part because of Trump’s own sweeping tariffs imposed earlier this year.By suggesting that cutting tariffs will reduce prices — and then issuing a sweeping set of exemptions that took effect retroactively — Trump has inadvertently conceded that tariffs function like taxes that raise costs for Americans. This contradicts years of his rhetoric insisting that “foreign countries pay” and that his duties do not fuel inflation.Economists, businesses, and multiple studies have long shown that US importers pay tariffs and often pass those costs on to consumers. Even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration expects prices for items like coffee and bananas to fall once tariff reductions are announced. Time will tell whether companies reverse the increases.This was not the only recent contradiction. A few days before the “coffee price admission”, Donald Trump acknowledged that American consumers “might be paying something.” The remark came after a reporter cited Chief Justice John Roberts ’ description of tariffs as taxes paid by Americans. Though Trump insisted the US still “gains tremendously,” his comment amounts to a rare admission that tariffs do raise costs for consumers — contradicting his previous statements insisting “foreign countries pay”.When American companies import components from abroad to assemble products domestically, they now pay tariffs on those inputs. A World Bank analysis examining the US-China trade war demonstrated that tariffs on imports of Chinese upstream intermediate goods negatively affect US downstream exports, output and employment. The effects are particularly severe in US industries that rely heavily on targeted intermediate goods.This creates a cascade of cost increases. When companies face tariffs on inputs essential for production—semiconductors, steel, or automotive components—they have limited ability to substitute domestically, amplifying cost pressures throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve's June 2025 Monetary Policy Report acknowledged this dynamic, noting that ""input cost pressures were widespread in manufacturing and retail, largely reflecting tariff-induced increases. ""Trump administration officials have claimed that tariffs are not driving inflation, pointing to specific data suggesting certain metrics have declined. This statement requires careful interpretation based on the timing of tariff effects discovered through rigorous economic research.The San Francisco Federal Reserve's analysis of historical international data reveals that tariffs initially create a negative demand shock that temporarily suppresses inflation even as prices for tariffed goods rise. The mechanism operates as follows: Uncertainty about future trade policy causes firms to delay investment and consumers to reduce spending. This demand contraction creates downward pressure on overall price levels that can temporarily mask the upward pressure from higher tariff costs. Foreign exporters, facing reduced demand, may lower their prices to maintain market share.However, this is a temporary phenomenon lasting approximately 1-2 years. Subsequently, inflation surges as supply-side pressures dominate. The San Francisco Fed found that inflation ""peaks three years after the initial change in tariffs."" The administration's statements about stable or declining prices capture data from early 2025—the demand-shock phase—while ignoring the cost-push inflation that follows.This timeline is critical for understanding the economic logic: immediately after tariff increases, weak demand may suppress overall inflation even while specific goods prices rise. But this represents economic contraction, not success. Americans reduce consumption not because they choose to but because they face economic uncertainty and potential job losses. The cost comes later in the form of persistent, elevated inflation years 2-3 after tariff implementation.Tariff revenues have surged in recent months. According to Fox Business, the US collected a record $34.2 billion in October alone. Total tariff receipts reached $215.2 billion in fiscal year 2025, and the Treasury has already reported $41.6 billion in collections so far for fiscal 2026.Since Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs, monthly revenues have climbed sharply — rising from $23.9 billion in May to $29 billion in July, while August and September together generated $62.6 billion. Trump has repeatedly highlighted these figures, arguing that tariff revenues — now at historic highs — could finance his proposed one-time $2,000 dividend for low- and middle-income households.Yale Budget Lab's analysis quantifies this tradeoff: while all 2025 tariffs raise government revenue, they simultaneously reduce consumer welfare and economic output more than the revenue collected. As of November 2025, Yale estimates the short-run per-household income loss at approximately $1,700, with the post-substitution effect settling at a $1,300 loss per household.Furthermore, Trump's promise of $2,000 dividend payments faces a fundamental mathematics problem. The Tax Foundation estimated that Trump's new tariffs would raise only $158.4 billion in 2025 and $207.5 billion in 2026. But checks limited to tax filers with incomes below $100,000 could cost $279.8 billion—already exceeding two years of projected revenue. Expanding payments to include non-filers could push costs to $606.8 billion, nearly double the expected 2025–26 tariff revenue.The data points overwhelmingly in one direction: tariffs function as a tax on Americans, not on foreign rivals.As mounting evidence shows prices rising even as Washington records historic revenue, Trump’s strategy exposes a deeper dilemma — whether a policy can remain politically popular while imposing growing economic costs on the very households it claims to protect.How the administration navigates that contradiction may determine not only the trajectory of the economy but also the durability of its “America First” economic narrative.","President Donald Trump has framed his sweeping tariff policy as essential for protecting American workers and manufacturing.

Trump's tariffs hitting US markets? Asian nations turn to Europe for fundraising; 'need to diversify away from dollar',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-tariffs-hitting-us-markets-asian-nations-turn-to-europe-for-fundraising-need-to-diversify-away-from-dollar/articleshow/125814822.cms,"Russia Backs India’s Energy Needs As Putin Defies Trump And Promises Steady Fuel Supplies To Delhi

Asian borrowers have begun turning their backs on the US, reaching out to other alternatives for fundraising as they aim to avoid US President Donald Trump's tariffs. Now, they have turned towards Europe, pouring billions of dollars in bond issuance, hinting at a possible erosion of America’s dominance in global capital raising.Bloomberg data shows that 23% of Asia Pacific bond sales across euros and dollars this year were denominated in euros, the highest on record and six percentage points above 2024 levels. Companies and governments from the region have issued $100.7 billion of euro notes in 2025, representing a 75% jump from last year, and several of those deals emerged as the most oversubscribed in Europe’s publicly syndicated debt market during their launch week.The US dollar still sits at the top currency for funding, and Asian borrowers have increased dollar-denominated issuance by 29% this year. But the greenback’s share has slipped, reflecting a gradual narrowing of its long-held financing advantage.“A key driver is the need to diversify away from US dollar concentration,” said Daniel Kim, co-head of debt capital markets for Asia Pacific at HSBC told Bloomberg.“This year’s surge in euro-denominated bond issuance stems from a confluence of strategic motives that go beyond the routine refinancing.”Investors have also been unsettled by Trump’s continued pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates despite persistent inflation concerns. Confidence in the dollar’s pre-eminence has weakened, and with the greenback falling 11% against the euro, investor appetite has moved to euro assets. Asian borrowers have followed that shift, expanding issuance to meet demand, Bloomberg reported.“De-dollarization or diversification of investment portfolios to have more deployment in non-dollar currencies is a theme we have witnessed this year,” Ben Wang, head of offshore China debt capital markets at Deutsche Bank AG said. The expert further added that while the euro accounted for only a small portion of Deutsche Bank’s APAC bond trading early in the year, it rose to “more than 10%, even 20%” after the second half began.Lower funding costs have also encouraged Asian borrowers to tap Europe, with euro markets now providing financing more cheaply than dollars or domestic currencies for some issuers. The premium for swapping euros into dollars has fallen to 3.1 basis points, nearing a five-year low, according to Bloomberg data.Forecasts of the dollar losing its reserve-currency status have repeatedly proven wrong, and greenback issuance has surged for years. The long-term shift remains uncertain. As of June, 63% of bonds issued outside borrowers’ home currencies were denominated in dollars, up 20 percentage points since late 2007, according to the Bank for International Settlements. During the same period, the euro’s share fell from 32% to 25%.Still, the resurgence of the euro among Asian borrowers reflects what Martin Schulz, chief economist at Fujitsu Ltd. in Japan, describes as a rebalancing after years of dollar dominance. “We have a more multipolar world,” he said.Several landmark euro deals have reinforced the trend. China’s €4 billion sale drew more than €100 billion in bids, while Japanese telecom group NTT Inc. completed a €5.5 billion fundraising, the largest corporate euro issue from Asia in 2025.“It gives you a broader market to invest in, with cash flows from different regions and different types of companies,” said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for core investments at Axa Investment Managers in London. “It is a fairly healthy development.”The pipeline shows no signs of slowing. Deutsche Bank’s APAC head of credit analysis Owen Gallimore expects Asian euro issuance to rise to $125 billion in 2026, representing growth of more than 20%.“We see issuers on the whole looking to expand their footprint, not just within Asia but also outside, with Europe continuing to be a key marketplace,” said Henry Loh, head of Asia credit at Aberdeen Investments.“We expect to see growing interest in euro issuance to finance this growth.”",23% of Asia Pacific bond sales across euros and dollars this year were denominated in euros. Companies and governments from the region have issued $100.7 billion of euro notes in 2025.

The latest commitment compares with €165 billion earmarked for 2025–2029 and €180 billion for 2024–2028, with 2024 marking the peak year for spending.Since that peak, the group — which houses brands such as Porsche and Audi — has been squeezed by higher costs and weaker margins, hit by US tariffs on imported vehicles and intensifying competition in China. The strain has been felt most acutely at Porsche, which derives nearly half of its sales from the US and China combined.Porsche recently unveiled a significant rollback of its electric vehicle strategy as profits came under pressure. Speaking to Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, Blume said the focus of the latest investment plan was firmly “on Germany and Europe,” particularly in products, technology and infrastructure.Blume added that discussions on an extended savings programme at Porsche are expected to continue into 2026. He also said he does not expect Porsche to grow in China, though localising production across the wider Volkswagen group remains an option. A China-specific Porsche model could make sense at some point, he said.On Audi, Blume noted that any decision on building a manufacturing plant in the United States would depend on whether Washington offers substantial financial support.Blume, who will step down as Porsche CEO in January to concentrate fully on running Volkswagen Group, said his recent contract extension as Volkswagen chief executive until 2030 signalled continued backing from the Porsche and Piëch families as well as the German state of Lower Saxony, the company’s largest shareholders.“But it is true, of course, that shareholders have suffered losses since Porsche went public three years ago.

While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

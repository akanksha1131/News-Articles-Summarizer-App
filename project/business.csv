"Gold price prediction: What's the outlook for October 3, 2025?

(AI image)

Gold prices are likely to maintain a bullish momentum in the coming days. However, today’s technical set-up signals a sell on rise strategy, says Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities.

Here is his strategy for gold investors:

Gold Intraday Trading View: Sell on Rise Strategy

Rationale:

Entry Zone: SELL GOLD DEC NEAR 117250-117400

Stop-Loss (SL): 118200

Target (TGT): 116400

Conclusion:

Gold price prediction today:The gold market is currently in a state of high volatility, with strong underlying bullish momentum offset by a potential for short-term correction. For intraday traders, a ""sell on rise"" strategy near key resistance levels is a high-risk, high-reward approach that can be considered.This analysis, based on a combination of intraday technical indicators, outlines the rationale behind a ""sell on rise"" setup for the MCX Gold December contract.The market is fundamentally bullish, but the technicals suggest it may be overextended in the very short term.The proposed sell-on-rise strategy is based on the premise that the confluence of overbought indicators (RSI and Bollinger Bands) and the price stalling at a key resistance level (117250-117400) will lead to a temporary correction. The current price action may be a result of profit-booking by short-term traders.This entry point is strategically chosen to be at a key resistance level where the price has previously faced selling pressure.The stop-loss is placed well above the recent high, providing a safety net in case the bullish momentum continues and breaks out of the overbought zone. This is a critical risk management component for a counter-trend trade.This target is a plausible short-term objective, aligning with the previous day's low or a key support level, where a correction might find a foothold.While the overall trend for gold remains strongly bullish, the intraday technical setup presents an opportunity for a short-term, high-risk ""sell on rise"" trade. This strategy is for nimble intraday traders who are comfortable with counter-trend setups and have a strict risk management plan. The trade relies on a temporary correction fueled by overbought conditions and profit-booking rather than a reversal of the primary trend.","Gold prices are likely to maintain a bullish momentum in the coming days.

Youngest billionaire vs youngest entrants

India’s richest and overall trends





Chennai-born Aravind Srinivas, 31, has emerged as India’s youngest billionaire, debuting on the M3M Hurun India Rich List 2025. As the founder and CEO of AI startup Perplexity, Srinivas is gaining recognition for his work in generative AI, having an estimated net worth of Rs 21,190 crore.Srinivas’ rise signals a shift in India’s wealth landscape, where young tech entrepreneurs are joining traditional industrialists among the country’s richest. While Mukesh Ambani reclaimed the top spot in 2025, Srinivas’ entry highlights the growing influence of technology-driven entrepreneurship in wealth creation, particularly in AI, fintech, and digital platforms.Born on June 7, 1994, in Chennai, Srinivas studied at IIT Madras and later earned a PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2021, focusing on contrastive learning and transformer-based models.He worked at OpenAI, DeepMind, and Google, contributing to projects including DALL-E 2, HaloNet, and ResNet-RS. In August 2022, he co-founded Perplexity AI, an AI-powered chat search engine leveraging GPT-3 models, and has invested in startups like ElevenLabs and Suno.Srinivas, 31, made his debut as a billionaire, becoming the youngest billionaire on the Hurun list. Meanwhile, Zepto co-founders Kaivalya Vohra (22) and Aadit Palicha (23) also appeared on the list, making them the youngest entrants overall, though their net worths are below the billionaire threshold.Despite a 6 per cent dip in his wealth, Mukesh Ambani returned as India’s richest individual with Rs 9.55 lakh crore, ahead of Gautam Adani (Rs 8.14 lakh crore).Roshni Nadar Malhotra of HCL entered the top three for the first time with Rs 2.84 lakh crore, becoming the richest woman in India. The Hurun list now counts over 350 billionaires and 1,687 individuals with wealth above Rs 1,000 crore, including 148 newcomers, with India adding nearly one new billionaire per week over the past two years.","Chennai-born Aravind Srinivas, 31, has emerged as India’s youngest billionaire, debuting on the M3M Hurun India Rich List 2025.

India Has Distinguished Itself As An Anchor Of Stability In Turbulent Global Eco: RBI Guv





NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Friday there will be limited impact of external shocks on India’s growth, due to strong domestic consumption and investment.“The Indian economy is resilient and continues to grow sustainably,” she said at the Kautilya Economic Conclave.The Indian economy is estimated to have grown 7.8% during the June quarter on the back of a revival in consumption, which is expected to get a further boost after the reduction in GST rates last month. India is projected to remain the world’s fastest growing major economy and earlier this week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) revised the annual growth projection for FY26 to 6.8%.RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra also said India has distinguished itself as an anchor of stability in a turbulent global economy due to strong reserves, low inflation and narrow current account deficit. “Despite all odds, the economy seems well settled into an equilibrium of resilient growth,” he said at the event organised by the finance ministry and the Institute of Economic Growth (IEG).“Current trade policies and restrictions could damage, perhaps permanently, growth in some of the economies,” Malhotra said, while also noting the fiscal strain on countries across the globe.The economy is grappling with the impact of a stiff 50% tariff on shipments to the US, casting some shadow on exports but govt has refused to buckle under pressure from Donald Trump to open up the farm sector and stop purchase of Russian oil.Even other countries are dealing with unilateral tariff actions by the American president.“The international order is morphing. Trade flows are being reshaped, alliances are being tested, investments are being rerouted along geopolitical lines, and shared commitments are being re-examined,” Sitharaman said.She said that the world is seeing structural transformation and not just temporary disruption. “Wars and strategic rivalries are redrawing the boundaries of cooperation and conflict. Alliances that once appeared solid are being tested, and new coalitions are emerging. For India, these dynamics highlight both vulnerability and resilience. Our capacity to absorb shocks is strong, while our economic leverage is evolving. ”The minister said the world is facing an era of unprecedented global uncertainty and volatility, and the task before nations is not only to manage uncertainty but to confront trade, financial and energy imbalances.IEG president N K Singh said that the reforms initiated by govt will help the economy. “Notwithstanding the uncertainties, the deepening of the structural reforms process continues at a formidable pace. The far-reaching changes to GST will enhance fiscal space, boost consumption, ameliorate ease of business, reinforce investor confidence, and seek higher economic growth. It would be an important factor in mitigating the adverse effects of external factors. ”",India has distinguished itself as an anchor of stability in a turbulent global economy.

NEW DELHI: On the back of a fillip provided by a reduction in GST on 375 items, Indian consumers flocked to stores and car dealerships resulting in the highest Navratri sales in over a decade, govt officials said, citing industry data.They argued that the move lowered prices, helping families upgrade vehicles, buy white goods and spend more freely on lifestyle products, “turning festive cheer into record-breaking consumption”.GST rates for food items, daily-use products, white goods, cement and automobiles have been slashed as the Centre and the states agreed to reduce the number of slabs and end cess on all luxury and sin products, barring tobacco. Apart from making the indirect tax regime simpler, the idea was to boost consumption, even if it resulted in a temporary impact on tax collections.“By rationalising GST slabs and easing the tax burden on both essential and aspirational items, govt fostered an environment of confident spending. As a result, brands and retailers reported sales growth ranging from 25% to 100%, marking a major boost for India’s consumption-driven economy,” an official said.Although companies had complained about an adverse impact on sales after PM Narendra Modi first announced the plan for GST rate rationalisation in his Independence Day speech, collections in Sept – based on transactions in Aug – grew at over 9%, the fastest pace of growth in four months, according to the data released on Wednesday.While goods and services are more affordable, especially after govt nudged businesses to pass on the benefits to consumers, pent up demand is also a factor behind a surge in sales over the last 10 days.As a result, companies such as Maruti Suzuki , the country’s largest carmaker, reported 3.5 lakh bookings with nearly 2.5 lakh pending orders. By the end of Navratri, it was expected to deliver 2 lakh vehicles, 2.3 times last year’s level of 85,000 cars. Similarly, M&M has reported a 60% jump in its top selling XUV700 and Scorpio N sales, while demand for Hyundai’s Creta and Venue are also seen to be strong.In the consumer electronics space, companies and top retailers are reporting significant rise in sales.","GST rates for food items, daily-use products, white goods, cement and automobiles have been slashed.

Billionaire family offices face Sebi scrutiny: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/billionaire-family-offices-face-sebi-scrutiny-report/articleshow/124296970.cms,"File photo





Markets regulator Sebi has begun discussions on bringing family offices under its oversight, as the country’s billionaires become a growing force on exchanges, people familiar with the matter said. The discussions include asking family offices to disclose their entities, assets and investment returns for the first time, as well as a separate category to regulate the investment vehicles.Sebi wants more visibility into how sprawling family-run conglomerates invest in publicly traded securities and the potential risks, said the people. The markets regulator held meetings with some of the nation’s biggest family offices earlier this year, and asked for written submissions from others. The final shape and timing of the new rules are unclear, the sources said. There is no specific regulation for family offices in India currently. Sebi on Friday said it is not considering any regulatory framework for family offices.The push shows how the country’s super-rich families have become dominant players with significant investments that can disrupt markets. Family offices, which numbered just a handful in India two decades ago, have emerged as important financiers to startups, investors in private equity and IPOs.Many invest through regulated entities like alternative investment funds or shadow lenders.Several family offices are already anchor investors in IPOs, such as Azim Premji’s Premji Invest, the Bajaj automobile dynasty’s Bajaj Holdings and Investment, and the private investment firms of tech billionaires Shiv Nadar and Narayana Murthy, data from Prime Database showed. Sebi has also sought views on allowing the firms to participate as qualified institutional buyers, the sources said.",Sebi wants more visibility into how sprawling family-run conglomerates invest in publicly traded securities.

MUMBAI: RBI has released a draft circular revising its framework for lending to related parties, a move expected to significantly improve ease of doing business in the financial sector. By introducing scale-based materiality thresholds, the draft ensures that only sizeable loans to related parties require board or committee approval, replacing earlier blanket restrictions that often hampered operational flexibility.Independent directors from other banks will no longer be classified as related persons, resolving ambiguities that had complicated compliance. Principle-based exemptions further ease rigid constraints, allowing institutions to tailor lending within the regulatory perimeter.The circular also strengthens supervisory reporting and disclosure requirements. A wide array of entities—including commercial banks and small finance bank smust now furnish detailed reports on related-party transactions, enhancing transparency.","The draft ensures that only sizeable loans to related parties require board or committee approval.

Roadblocks in motown





NEW DELHI: The festive rush is there but car and two-wheeler companies, flush with orders after GST reduction and price cuts, are now facing a unique problem — ‘on time delivery’ of vehicles during festivals.While customers are seeking delivery around Dhanteras and Diwali, companies are finding it challenging to do so due to shortage of trucks and trailers. The shortage of rare earth magnets, despite initial assurances around normalisation of supplies from China, is also delaying production, particularly of electrics and two-wheelers.Industry officials told TOI that sudden rush in demand for deliveries — across automobiles, FMCG, ecommerce, fashion and lifestyle segments — has put a huge pressure on the truck industry with fleets working round-the-clock to deliver across the country. “Add to this the usual gifting rush around Diwali and you have a problem that is increasingly becoming very challenging to solve,” an industry official said.“Surge in festive demand has led to significant constraints on availability of trailers. We are working to improve dispatches to our dealer network within constraints,” Nalinikanth Gollagunta, CEO, automotive division, M&M said.The same situation is being faced by Maruti, which has seen a huge recovery in demand for small cars after GST cut. “We have pending deliveries of 2.5 lakh vehicles, and most people prefer it around Diwali . We are working overtime and are now using railways to ensure that dispatches happen faster and on time,” Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer (marketing & sales) at Maruti Suzuki , said.Amit Kamat, chief commercial officer at Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, said surge in demand for trailers and trucks began after Sept 22 as new GST rates came into play. “We expect this surge to be temporary and are working with logistics partners to expedite dispatches… Despite challenges, we are working tirelessly to expedite deliveries to our dealerships in time for Diwali celebrations.”Luxury players, such as BMW, are also feeling the pinch due to sudden rush in demand. “Customers like to take the delivery on Dhanteras and Diwali. This year, demand for deliveries on these specific days is much higher as pent-up demand from Aug-Sept is also coming into play… When the bottleneck suddenly opened, there were certain logistics challenges in the start, but they are streamlined now,” Hardeep Singh Brar, president and CEO of BMW Group India, said.It’s similar for two-wheeler industry. Apart from logistics, companies are also plagued by shortage of magnets. “The cut in retail prices has meant that there has been a sudden rise in demand for scooters and motorcycles. Rare earth magnet issue is hampering production. Sudden rush in bookings is leading to pressure on deliveries,” a top official of a leading company said.","Customers seeking delivery around Dhanteras and Diwali.

‘Give temporary support to tariff-affected sectors’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/give-temporary-support-to-tariff-affected-sectors/articleshow/124297085.cms,"Albert Park (File photo)

How do you look at India against the backdrop of what’s happening geopolitically, especially the Trump tariffs?

How should India navigate the challenges around tariffs?

Should India go for a selective reduction in tariffs through trade deals or should reduce duties across the board as there are fears that it may lead to a surge in imports from China?

There is demand for govt support to some of the sectors which may be hit by the US tariffs. Are you in favour of such support and how long should that last?





Albert Park, chief economist at the Asian Development Bank, is in India and sat down with TOI to speak on a range of issues from India’s growth to impact of Trump tariffs. Excerpts:We’ve downgraded our forecast compared to April. India is now facing one of the highest tariff rates, 50%. Thankfully, services exports are not being targeted by the Trump regime, which is important for India. Exports going to the US that are subject to the 50% tariff are around 1.2% of India’s GDP. It’s not going to have a major effect on growth, which is why our downgrades are fairly modest.Our growth forecast for India is still quite robust, 6.5%. It’s the second highest growth for all countries in Asia. That reflects a lot of good things that are happening in terms of very robust domestic demand, strong investment, both public sector and private investment.We always say try to turn every crisis into an opportunity. It is good to engage in negotiations with the US and try to develop levels of understanding and see if you can’t bring some of those tariffs down or at least avoid the risk of further escalation. The second aspect is to think of internal reforms.ADB has always advocated an open, multilateral trading system.It will probably be a good idea for India to try and lower its tariff, not allow them to keep creeping up, as they have been. Maybe, negotiations with the US are an opportunity to mobilise more support for that direction of reform, which will definitely contribute to improving India’s export competitiveness because you need cheap imported inputs to be competitive on exports. We know that greater use of imported inputs helps you improve productivity and quality of goods.Most favoured nation-style tariff cuts will be more effective as it represents greater trade liberalisation. The concern about imports from China is a sensitive issue, but the fact is that you can’t fear competition. There are issues with China. Some people have been concerned that maybe China has overproduced. Based on WTO principles, anti-dumping, countervailing duties can be availed of. There may be goods where China is much more competitive and importing them is good for consumers, and producers, if these are intermediate inputs.Part of having closer economic ties with China, hopefully there will be understanding at a high level, that greater efforts to liberalise trade or FDI into India from China, should also be reciprocated by greater efforts the other way too. That it’ll help generate more markets for Indian goods in China or opportunities for Indian investments in China.There is rationale for govt to step in when there are sudden shocks because you don’t want these firms exiting when they have capabilities. You also care about the welfare of their employees. How long? It shouldn’t be too long. Most countries err on the side of too long. But if a firm cannot prove that it’s competitive, that maybe it was producing something that only could be sold in the US and now it’s just not being successful at finding another way to be successful, then you’re not doing them a favour or helping the efficiency of govt resource use by prolonging support. It just needs to be temporary.","Albert Park, chief economist at the Asian Development Bank, is in India and sat down with TOI to speak on a range of issues from India’s growth to impact of Trump tariffs. ‘We’ve downgraded our forecast compared to April.

NEW DELHI: Govt’s policy tank Niti Aayog proposed a comprehensive designed framework to enhance tax certainty and predictability for foreign investors. It recommended the introduction of an optional, industry-specific presumptive taxation scheme for foreign firms.Releasing a working paper on Friday, it also backed broader legislative clarity, administrative efficiency, robust dispute resolution mechanisms, and strategic alignment with international best practices. It said this multi-pronged approach is anticipated to dramatically reduce litigation, boost investor confidence, improve administrative efficiency, and secure India’s tax base by attracting higher quality, sustainable FDI.It recommends that the finance ministry consider the proposed framework for inclusion in future finance bills, following consultations with industry, experts, and treaty partners. “This reform would be a significant step towards making India a more attractive and predictable investment destination,” said an official statement.The working paper highlights that FDI and FPI are recognised as vital catalysts for the country’s economic growth. A stable tax regime is crucial for instilling confidence in foreign investors. It said foreign investors frequently encounter significant tax uncertainty and compliance burdens, particularly stemming from issues linked to permanent establishment (PE) and the attribution of profits.","Niti Aayog proposed a comprehensive designed framework to enhance tax certainty and predictability for foreign investors.

MUMBAI: RBI has recognised the Finance Industry Development Council (FIDC) as the official self-regulatory organisation (SRO) for NBFCs, aiming to tighten compliance, foster innovation, and boost sector development. The decision follows the June 19, 2024 press release inviting applications and the March 21 omnibus framework for SRO recognition. RBI received three applications, of which two were rejected for incompleteness.SROs are designed to complement statutory regulations, establish industry standards, draft codes of conduct, oversee compliance, settle disputes, and serve as intermediaries between members and the regulator. They must operate with independence, credibility, and sound governance, while keeping RBI informed through regular reporting and annual returns.To qualify, an SRO must be a Section 8 not-for-profit, with diversified shareholding, sufficient net worth, and either broad sector representation or a credible plan to achieve it. Its directors must meet fit-and-proper criteria, and boards are required to include at least one-third independent members, supported by adequate human and technical resources.The NBFC, despite accounting for nearly a third of lending activity has not had an SRO. However, segments of non-banks including microfinance institutions and digital lenders have their own SRO for some time.","RBI has recognised the Finance Industry Development Council (FIDC) as the official self-regulatory organisation (SRO) for NBFCs.

Revamp of rules





MUMBAI: RBI has proposed a revamp of rules on external commercial borrowings. The draft guidelines for 2025, the most extensive rejig since a Dec 2018 framework, replace uniform caps with limits tied to a borrower’s financial strength. Companies may raise up to $1 billion or 300% of their net worth (whichever is higher), while financial sector firms regulated by RBI, Sebi, Irdai or PFRDA face no cap.The draft removes rigid borrowing costs and sets them according to market conditions under the oversight of authorised dealer banks. Earlier, companies could raise up to $750 million annually, with a temporary ceiling of $1.5 billion until Dec 2022.The new rules extend eligibility beyond firms open to foreign direct investment. All resident entities incorporated under a Central or State Act, except individuals, can now tap the route. Firms under insolvency or restructuring, or even those under investigation, may borrow subject to disclosure to their banks. Lender eligibility has also widened to include any person residing abroad, along with offshore branches or IFSC units of Indian regulated lenders.Maturity rules remain unchanged at three years, though manufacturing companies may raise up to $50 million for tenors of one to three years.Waivers have been provided for equity conversion, mergers, resolution or liquidation. The earlier ceiling of 450 basis points over benchmark rates has been scrapped. Only short-term loans of less than three years must comply with trade credit cost caps.End-use rules have been consolidated. Borrowed funds cannot be used for chit funds, Nidhi companies, farmhouses, plantation activity unless permitted under FDI, transferable development rights or securities trading. But they may be deployed for industrial land linked to projects, group on-lending by regulated entities, overseas investment, mergers and acquisitions, and certain primary issuances by non-financial firms.The draft also tightens fund-flow rules. ECB proceeds must be repatriated to India immediately unless earmarked for foreign currency expenditure. Until deployment, funds can only be parked in fixed deposits with local banks, top-rated treasury bills, or deposits with highly rated foreign banks.","The draft guidelines for 2025 replace uniform caps with limits tied to a borrower's financial strength.

Taylor Swift’s new album - Booster shot loading for the US economy?

US Federal Reserve’s challenges





The US economy is faced with the twin conundrum - growth challenges are mounting, and inflation is not in the US Federal Reserve’s comfort zone. At such a time, the release of Taylor Swift ’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, may spell good news for the central bank!Now, what does the release of a music album by a famous singer have to do with the economic decisions of the US Federal Reserve and its chair Jerome Powell? Confused? We explain.Taylor Swift has released her latest studio album, marking her twelfth record. Should this launch lead to another extensive concert tour, it would positively impact the economic objectives of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and fellow policymakers.According to a report by Barron’s, the last time Taylor Swift did a mega-tour, it resulted in a possible boost for the US economy. The economic influence of the Eras Tour, comprising 149 performances across five continents, remains challenging to quantify precisely. Nevertheless, various analyses indicate substantial economic effects. Nomura's economists calculated that the initial US portion of the tour stimulated consumer expenditure of $5 billion, including ticket sales and accommodation costs, the Barron’s report said.The Life of a Showgirl was unveiled early Friday. According to music analytics platform Chartmetric, the album achieved an unprecedented milestone by surpassing 5 million pre-saves on Spotify.Those attempting to capitalise on the release through stock investments might face disappointment, the report said. Universal Music Group, which owns Swift's label Republic Records, receives a portion of streaming and publishing earnings. However, the company's potential earnings might be restricted as Swift maintains ownership of her master recordings.Despite Target keeping numerous stores open until midnight for fans to purchase both regular and exclusive CD versions, their shares increased by merely 0.1% on Friday. The S&P 500 index recorded a 0.2% rise.However, Barron's report notes that the market cannot disregard The Life of a Showgirl entirely. The crucial consideration for investors centres on whether Swift will launch another extensive tour following this album.A multi-billion dollar economic stimulus, brought on as a result of a mega tour like last time, would be beneficial in the current climate, the report said.With employment figures declining whilst inflation exceeds 2%, the Federal Reserve faces significant challenges. Market analysts anticipate the central bank will implement interest rate reductions this month, followed by additional cuts in December, aiming to support employment levels.“The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen,” the FOMC statement said.Should The Life of a Showgirl generate a touring schedule comparable to Eras, Powell may have Swift to thank!","Taylor Swift has released her latest studio album, marking her twelfth record.

US stocks continued to climb on Friday, as Wall Street edged toward the finish of another record-setting week, buoyed by optimism around artificial intelligence and hopes of easier interest rates despite a partial government shutdown.The S&P 500 rose 0.2% and is on track for its seventh winning week in nine, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 167 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.2%, AP reported. All three indexes came off all-time highs set the previous day.Trading may see increased volatility later in the session as reports on the US services sector are released. Treasury yields in the bond market were largely steady ahead of the data.Normally, the first Friday of the month draws attention to the US government’s monthly jobs report, which details hiring and unemployment trends. But the third day of the partial shutdown has delayed the release, leaving investors and policymakers without fresh employment data.Past shutdowns have typically had limited impact on markets and the economy, though President Donald Trump has threatened large-scale firings of federal workers this time.Investors remain focused on AI-related developments, which have propelled the market in recent weeks. The sector received a boost after Japan’s Hitachi signed a memorandum of understanding with OpenAI, following similar agreements with South Korean firms. Hitachi’s stock surged 10.3% in Tokyo, while US tech giants Nvidia and Broadcom rose 0.6% and 1.5%, respectively.However, caution persists over the sector’s rapid growth, with some analysts warning of a potential bubble that could disappoint investors. Applied Materials was among the day’s losers, dropping 2.5% after warning of a roughly $110 million revenue impact in Q4 due to expanded US export restrictions on certain Chinese customers.Global markets were mixed, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 1.9%, while European indexes showed varied performance. In the US bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield inched down to 4.09% from 4.10% late Thursday.","The S&P 500 is on track for its seventh winning week in nine.

The United States has delayed the release of a key employment report as a partial government shutdown entered its third day on Friday, creating uncertainty over the state of the world’s largest economy.Other economic indicators scheduled for publication this week, including weekly unemployment claims, have also been postponed, depriving policymakers and businesses of crucial information for decision-making, AFP reported.The shutdown has already led to hundreds of thousands of federal employees being sent home without pay across multiple agencies. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that approximately 750,000 employees could be furloughed daily if funding lapses continue.The US labor market has been under close scrutiny in recent months following signs of slowing hiring, which prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the first time in 2025. The absence of updated official data has raised concerns about the Fed’s ability to make fully informed monetary policy decisions.“Without up-to-date data, the Federal Reserve will not have the full picture it needs to make decisions this month about interest rates that will impact every family across the country,” warned Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. She called on the Trump administration to release data already collected despite the shutdown.The data freeze adds to uncertainty for markets and policymakers, with analysts cautioning that prolonged delays could affect economic planning and financial stability.",The partial government shutdown entered its third day on Friday.

Nearly 95,00,00 layoffs have happened by US employers through September 2025, marking the highest such figures since 2020, according to outplacement specialists Challenger, Gray & Christmas quoted in a CBS report.The increase in workforce reductions coincides with a slowdown in the labour market, with organisations significantly reducing their recruitment plans, as employment data indicates. Firms are planning to recruit 58% fewer staff for the remainder of the year compared to their projections from the previous year.Challenger, Gray & Christmas predicts the job cuts might exceed 1 million in 2025. Whilst current job losses are significant, they remain considerably lower than the 2020 figures, when pandemic-related business closures resulted in 2 million layoffs through September that year, according to Challenger's analysis.""Previous periods with this many job cuts occurred either during recessions or, as was the case in 2005 and 2006, during the first wave of automations that cost jobs in manufacturing and technology,"" said Andy Challenger, senior vice president and labour expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas according to the CBS report.Additional job losses might result from the government shutdown, as the White House Office of Management and Budget has instructed federal agencies to consider staff reductions during any closure period.The upcoming October 3 government jobs report is expected to be delayed due to the federal shutdown, with economists projecting 50,000 new jobs added last month according to FactSet data.In light of the delayed government report, economists are turning to alternative labor market indicators to assess employment conditions.ADP's private sector employment report showed a decline of 32,000 jobs in September.There are indications that job cuts may be slowing down. Challenger's latest data revealed businesses announced approximately 54,000 job cuts in September, marking a significant 37% decrease from August's nearly 86,000 announced cuts.Economists are closely monitoring these various employment metrics to gauge the overall health of the labor market during the government shutdown period.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced a 0.25 percentage point reduction in the benchmark interest rate, citing concerns about worker challenges, with plans for two more rate cuts in 2025. The Fed is closely monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness.Lower borrowing costs could provide support to the job market, as businesses would have greater capacity to expand and hire when interest rates decrease.The labor market is currently facing multiple challenges, according to Challenger.""Right now, we're dealing with a stagnating labor market, cost increases and a transformative new technology. With rate cuts on the way, we may see some stabilizing in the job market in the fourth quarter, but other factors could keep employers planning layoffs or holding off hiring,"" Challenger said.The Federal Reserve's actions reflect its ongoing efforts to balance economic growth with labor market stability through monetary policy adjustments.","Nearly 95,00,00 layoffs have happened by US employers through September 2025, marking the highest such figures since 2020.

Russian-Ukraine conflict: EU plans to use Moscow's frozen assets to fund Kyiv; here's how,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/russian-ukraine-conflict-eu-plans-to-use-moscows-frozen-assets-to-fund-kyiv-heres-how/articleshow/124289703.cms,"'Ukraine Surviving On Western Money': Hungary Slams Kyiv After Drone Intrusion Charge

Redirecting frozen funds





Size of the pot





Legal workaround





Who takes the risk









The European Union is working on a new financial plan to support Ukraine’s defence and rebuilding efforts by tapping into Russian central bank assets frozen in the West since Moscow’s invasion.Directly seizing these sovereign assets is banned under international law, so the European Commission has proposed a workaround that would allow EU governments to use the funds without technically confiscating them, Reuters reported.The plan involves using most of the 210 billion euros worth of Russian assets currently frozen in Europe, a sensitive issue for many EU capitals and the European Central Bank.The proposal has drawn broad political backing in principle, but several member states want more legal clarity before moving forward.Belgium, which hosts the Euroclear clearing house and has an annual national output of around 600 billion euros, has been particularly cautious about the financial and legal risks involved.When Russia launched its full-scale war in Ukraine, Euroclear held Russian central bank bonds. As these bonds matured, the proceeds were frozen under EU sanctions. The Commission’s plan would see these frozen cash balances channelled to the EU.In exchange, Euroclear would receive zero-coupon bonds from the Commission of the same value. The EU would then use the cash to issue what it calls a “Reparations Loan” to Ukraine.Kyiv would only repay this loan once it receives war reparations from Moscow in a future peace settlement, giving it access to the money immediately instead of waiting for compensation from Russia.Around $300 billion of Russian assets have been frozen worldwide. Of that, 210 billion euros ($229 billion) is held in Europe, with 185 billion euros managed by Euroclear in Brussels. Roughly 176 billion euros is already in cash, and another 9 billion euros in securities is set to mature in 2026.The EU would first use part of this to repay the 45 billion euros ($50 billion) G7 loan agreed with Ukraine last year, leaving about 140 billion euros to finance the new loan. The exact amount will depend on an International Monetary Fund assessment of Ukraine’s financial needs in 2026 and 2027. Finland and Sweden estimate that Kyiv will face a shortfall of around 130 billion euros during that period, Reuters reported.To avoid breaching international rules, the cash would be moved from Euroclear into a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) owned by EU or G7 governments. The Commission would then issue zero-coupon bonds to Euroclear, backed by the SPV. This structure is meant to protect Euroclear from legal challenges while allowing the EU to use the funds for investment rather than leaving them idle in overnight deposits at the European Central Bank.Russia has rejected the plan, describing it as an “illegal seizure” and warning of retaliatory measures.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said the risk would be shared among EU countries. The plan would need full guarantees from member states, with contributions proportionate to the size of their economies.Belgium has made it clear it does not want to shoulder the risk alone. Prime Minister Bart de Wever told EU leaders that Belgium’s hosting of Euroclear should not make it the only party accountable.“If we take (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's money, we use it, we're all going to be responsible if it goes wrong,” he said.He also insisted on strong legal assurances before Belgium signs off on the plan.",EU working on plan to tap into Russian central bank assets frozen in the West since Moscow’s invasion.

‘Pawn in trade negotiation’: China refuses to buy US soybeans; Donald Trump admin plans support for farmers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pawn-in-trade-negotiation-china-refuses-to-buy-us-soybeans-donald-trump-admin-plans-support-for-farmers/articleshow/124281710.cms,"



American farmers are looking at losing billions of dollars as Chinese importers have refused to buy US soybeans due to tensions between the two nations. To ease the blow, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent announced that the government will be rolling out new support measures for the farming sector.Bessent told CNBC that the federal government stands behind the farming community, which backed President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. “We’ve got their backs,” he said.“It’s unfortunate that Chinese leadership has decided to use the American farmers, soybean farmers in particular, as a hostage or pawn in the trade negotiations,” Bessent told Reuters.Trump on Wednesday said that soybeans would be a major topic of discussion when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping in four weeks.Bessent explained that buying American farm products is part of nearly every recent US trade deal. “So we’re going to see other countries substitute for China,” he said.However, despite efforts by the administration and the soybean industry, no other markets have come close to matching China’s usual purchase volumes. A record harvest has also added pressure on prices.Bessent said he met Trump and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins in the Oval Office on Wednesday.He asked farmers to expect “substantial support” to be announced on Tuesday, particularly for soybean growers.“On Tuesday, you’re going to see substantial support for the farmers, and we’re also going to be working with the Farm Credit Bureau to make sure that the farmers have what they need for next planting season,” he said.He added that an in-person meeting between Trump and Xi would help set the direction for future trade.“I think with President Trump's leadership and his relationship - the respect party chair Xi has for him - that this round, which would be our fifth round of talks, should show a pretty big breakthrough,” Bessent said.","Chinese importers have refused to buy US soybeans due to tensions between the two nations.

"'Starting to kick in': Trump hints at $1,000–$2,000 'tariff dividend' for Americans; what it means",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/starting-to-kick-in-trump-hints-at-10002000-tariff-dividend-for-americans-what-it-means/articleshow/124283109.cms,"







US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that he is considering giving Americans up to $2,000 in rebates from revenues generated by his tariff policies, calling the payments a “dividend to the people of America. ”“They’re just starting to kick in,” Trump said in an interview with One America News Network, referring to the tariffs imposed on foreign nations since April. “Ultimately, your tariffs are going to be over a trillion dollars a year,” he added.When the reporter asked about the potential size of the rebate, the US president declared, “We’re thinking maybe $1,000 to $2,000 – it would be great.”Trump said the funds would first be used to reduce the US national debt, currently at $37 trillion, which he described as “very little, relatively speaking” given the surge in government revenue from tariffs.“Number one, we’re paying down debt,” Trump stated, “because people have allowed the debt to go crazy.”“With that being said, we’ll pay back debt, but we also might make a distribution to the people,” he added.According to Treasury data cited by Fox Business, the federal government has collected approximately $214.9 billion from tariffs so far this year. September's tariff revenue reached $31.3 billion, $73 million lower than August's record.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had earlier projected that the total tariff revenue could reach at least $300 billion by year-end.The proposal comes as the Supreme Court prepares to hear a case in early November to determine whether the president has the authority to impose broad tariffs.Earlier rulings by lower courts and the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit questioned the legality of most of Trump’s levies but allowed them to remain in effect pending appeal.Bessent also asserted the top court that if the tariffs are ruled illegal, the government could be required to refund between $750 billion and $1 trillion in collected and projected revenue.","US President Donald Trump said he is considering giving Americans up to $2,000 in rebates from revenues generated by his tariff policies.

Berkshire Hathaway to acquire OxyChem for $9.7 billion: Last major deal under Warren Buffett's leadership?

Warren Buffett-owned Berkshire Hathaway is set to acquire Occidental Petroleum’s chemical division, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion, marking possibly the last major deal under the billionaire investor who owns the firm, set to retire by year-end.Notably, Buffett's name was absent from Thursday's announcement materials, as reported by Associated Press, suggesting a transition of leadership to Vice Chair Greg Abel, who will become CEO in January.Although Buffett will retain his position as chairman at Berkshire and continue to influence decisions regarding the company's substantial cash reserves exceeding $344 billion.The conglomerate's cash has accumulated as Buffett struggled to identify attractively priced major acquisitions since purchasing Alleghany Insurance for $11.6 billion in 2022. Increased competition from hedge funds has driven acquisition prices higher.OxyChem produces essential chemicals including chlorine for water treatment, vinyl chloride for plastics and calcium chloride for road de-icing. The business will complement Berkshire's existing chemical subsidiary, Lubrizol, acquired in 2011 for $9 billion.""Berkshire is acquiring a robust portfolio of operating assets, supported by an accomplished team,"" Abel said in a prepared statement.""We look forward to welcoming OxyChem as an operating subsidiary within Berkshire,"" he further said as quoted by AP.OxyChem's pretax earnings fell to $213 million in the second quarter, compared to nearly $300 million previously. Occidental has been divesting Permian Basin assets, generating $950 million for debt reduction. Following the December 2023 CrownRock acquisition, Occidental has sold approximately $4 billion in assets to address $7.5 billion in debt.Occidental plans to utilise $6.5 billion from the Berkshire transaction to reduce debt below their $15 billion target, established after the CrownRock acquisition.Prior to this deal, Berkshire owned over 28% of Occidental's stock, with warrants for an additional 83,911,942.38 shares at $59.586 each. Additionally, Berkshire held $8.5 billion in preferred Occidental shares from 2019, earning 8% annual dividends.While Buffett previously committed to maintaining Occidental stakes and continued purchasing shares, he informed shareholders in 2023 that complete acquisition wasn't planned.Berkshire's diverse portfolio includes insurance companies like Geico, BNSF railway, utilities, and renowned brands such as Dairy Queen and See's Candy, built over 60 years. The company also maintains stock holdings exceeding $250 billion, including significant investments in Apple, Coca-Cola, Bank of America and American Express.The OxyChem transaction is scheduled to conclude in the fourth quarter of this year.","Berkshire Hathaway set to acquire Occidental Petroleum's chemical division, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices reached unprecedented levels when markets opened on Thursday, driven by fresh optimism regarding potential interest rate reductions, whilst investors prepare for minimal economic data releases as the week concludes.At market opening, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 20.0 points, representing a 0.04% increase, reaching 46,461.11. The S&P 500 advanced by 20.1 points or 0.30%, opening at 6,731.31, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 130.7 points, equivalent to 0.57%, touching 22,885.905 at the start of trading.Technology stocks surged again following OpenAI’s announcement of partnerships with South Korean firms for its Stargate AI infrastructure project. Additionally, Nvidia rose 1.7 percent at the start of trading, while other tech firms remained in focus due to broader AI-related optimism. Tesla shares also climbed 1.6 percent after reporting a 7 percent increase in third-quarter sales.Stock indexes also climbed across Europe and Asia, while Treasury yields remained relatively steady after a US government shutdown delayed the weekly unemployment claims report. The US government went on a formal shutdown on October 1 after Republicans and Democrats failed to reach an agreement on federal fundingMeanwhile, Wall Street is hoping the US job market slows just enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to continue cutting interest rates—but not so much that it triggers a recession.Striking this balance is tricky, and delays in government economic reports add to the uncertainty. With stocks already hitting record highs on expectations of rate cuts, any sign that the cuts may not materialize could push the market lower.Investors currently expect nearly a 99 percent chance of a Fed rate cut later this month and an 87 percent chance of another cut in December.Wednesday’s ADP report showed the US private sector shed jobs in September, contrary to expectations of growth. Analysts said the weak data strengthens the case for Fed rate cuts in the coming months, though a partial government shutdown has delayed key economic reports, adding uncertainty.“The data emboldens calls for the Fed to ease rates in the months ahead,” said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, as quoted by AFP.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 20.0 points, representing a 0.04% increase, reaching 46,461.11.

EU steel tariffs: European Commission plans higher duties; aim to protect local producers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/eu-steel-tariffs-european-commission-plans-higher-duties-aim-to-protect-local-producers/articleshow/124270888.cms,"EU Envoy Urges Both Sides to Engage in Earnest Efforts to Meet India-EU FTA Year-End Target





The European Union is preparing to increase tariffs on steel imports as part of a push to protect local producers from cheap Asian steel and new trade barriers from the United States.The European Commission is expected to unveil a permanent plan next week, which will also slash the EU’s existing steel quotas for foreign steel by nearly 50%, EU industry chief Stephane Sejourne said, according to a source cited by Bloomberg.Under the new system, imports above the reduced quotas will face higher tariffs, similar to the US, which currently charges a 50% duty on imported steel.At present, the EU operates a temporary safeguard that imposes a 25% tariff once quotas are exceeded. That arrangement is due to expire next year, prompting the Commission to design a more lasting solution to replace it.The move comes as EU leaders meet in Copenhagen to discuss boosting the bloc’s defence capabilities.“Our reality today and tomorrow is security and security means armaments and armaments means steel,” Polish PM Donald Tusk said.“We have to protect our companies, our steel companies in Europe and in Poland,” Bloomberg quoted Tusk as saying.Europe’s steel industry has been under pressure for years from cheap imports from China and other Asian countries, which was further intensified by the US raising steel and aluminium tariffs to 50% shortly after Donald Trump took office.Sejourne added that while the EU supports free international trade, “we will not be the only ones to impose on ourselves the principles that others no longer apply,” according to someone familiar with his remarks.The proposal coincides with discussions on stricter EU climate targets for 2040, which could add further strain on energy-intensive industries such as steel, according to Bloomberg.Europe’s steel body, Eurofer, has called for stricter measures to match changing market conditions and urged a full post-2026 trade framework to tackle the harmful impact of global steel overcapacity on the EU market.“This is the first real measure to support our sector, and support quality jobs in Europe,” said director general Axel Eggert. “But there needs to be more.”","The European Commission is expected to unveil a permanent plan next week.

South Korea and the United States have reached a preliminary agreement on security, as both countries continue to negotiate trade and tariff issues, according to Yonhap news agency.In an interview published on Thursday, South Korean foreign minister Cho Hyun said that the US is currently reviewing a currency swap deal, a key demand from Seoul in the tariff discussions. However, the minister also hinted that it was not optimistic.Washington had agreed to cut tariffs on South Korean imports in return for a $350 billion investment package. However, talks on the details, including how the investments will be structured, have stalled.Though Cho said that the negotiations were ""actively"" ongoing, South Korea may take longer than Japan to finalise a deal. Japan finalised its investment package last month.Meanwhile, security discussions are advancing in parallel as the two nations continue to explore measures such as boosting South Korea’s defence spending, which is part of the broader plan aimed at reducing US tariffs, Reuters reported. Cho said the aim was to announce the security agreement before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju in late October, which US President Donald Trump is expected to attend.Trump said South Korea should shoulder more of its military costs and pay more for US troops stationed there. Responding to this, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Wednesday announced that the country will increase its defence budget by 8.2% next year, highlighting the need for stronger self-defence.""In the security field, an agreement has already been reached in general, which allows us to increase our national defence capabilities in necessary areas,"" Cho told Yonhap.Officials also said progress is being made on granting South Korea more rights to process nuclear fuel for industrial use, a move currently restricted under existing agreements.Cho did not dismiss the possibility of a meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as some ""speculative"" reports cited by Reuters suggested.Last month, North Korea said it would consider negotiations if the US stopped insisting on the complete denuclearisation of the country.","South Korea and the United States have reached a preliminary agreement on security, as both countries continue to negotiate trade and tariff issues.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

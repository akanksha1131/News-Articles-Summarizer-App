Tariff pressures still loom over summer outlook after softening US inflation in April,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tariff-pressures-still-loom-over-summer-outlook-after-softening-us-inflation-in-april/articleshow/121519332.cms,"The US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge eased more than expected in April, offering a temporary reprieve from price pressures even as new tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump began to take effect.According to data released Friday by the Commerce Department, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.1% year-over-year, down from a revised 2.3% in March. The figure came in slightly below the 2.2% median forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, keeping overall inflation just above the Fed’s 2% long-term target, AFP reported.On a monthly basis, headline inflation edged up 0.1%, mirroring the increase in the “core” PCE index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Core inflation rose 2.5% from a year earlier, just under the 2.6% economists had projected.“We're seeing evidence that we were on track for a perfect landing when it comes to inflation,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, speaking to AFP. “But that unfortunately came before the tariff storm that is likely to lead to an inflationary acceleration over the course of the summer.”The April price gains were largely driven by a 0.5% increase in prices for durable goods and energy, which was partially offset by a 0.3% decline in food prices.Trump’s newly imposed tariffs, dubbed “liberation day” duties, took effect on April 2, with a 10% levy applied to most countries and even higher rates imposed on key trading partners shortly thereafter. Though some of the measures have since been paused, legal battles are ongoing.This week, the US Court of International Trade ruled Trump exceeded his legal authority, only for a federal judge to grant a temporary stay, allowing the tariffs to remain in place during the appeal.While it's too early for these tariffs to be fully reflected in the data, Daco noted early signs of upward pressure, pointing out that furniture prices began climbing in April following the new duties. “That bodes poorly for the inflation outlook over the coming months,” he warned, suggesting that rising prices could begin to erode consumer spending.The Trump administration maintains that the tariffs will help reduce trade imbalances and won’t harm the broader economy, though many economists expect higher consumer prices and a slowdown in growth — at least in the short term.In more positive economic news, personal income rose 0.8% in April, significantly ahead of the 0.3% forecast. Additionally, the personal saving rate jumped to 4.9% from a revised 4.3% in March, indicating that consumers are holding onto more of their disposable income.For the Federal Reserve, Friday’s data may offer temporary relief. The central bank has kept interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, and officials continue to deliberate over the timing of future rate cuts.Still, the outlook remains uncertain. Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, cautioned that the current cooling in inflation may not last. “Inflation will likely reaccelerate for the remainder of 2025 as both supply and demand pressures will push annual inflation rates higher,” he wrote in a note shared with AFP.","In April, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.1% year-over-year, down from a revised 2.3% in March.

EB-5 visa demand

US President Donald Trump’s mounting restrictions on student visas, has many Indians presently in the US and prospective college applicants considering the EB-5 visa route. This visa scheme offers a route to permanent residency or Green Card for foreign investors who contribute $800,000 (approximately Rs 7 crore).International students at prestigious global universities are increasingly finding themselves caught in political and administrative conflicts, according to experts. Previously, status adjustments enabled students to remain in the US whilst obtaining work and travel permissions.Immigration lawyers have witnessed a doubling of EB-5 applications from Indian students during the last four to five months of Donald Trump's second presidential term.The current US administration's less welcoming stance towards international students has prompted those aged 19-24, particularly in sought-after disciplines such as computer science, biotech and finance, to increasingly pursue EB-5 visas.The annual quota for this category is restricted, with India allocated roughly 700 visas. Given that the US remains the preferred destination for higher education, with 86,000 Indians enrolled in 2024, experts anticipate intense competition for EB-5 visas this year.""There is a sharp jump in EB-5 applications,"" Rajneesh Pathak, founder of Global North Residency and Citizenship, an immigration law firm, told ET.

""They are willing to invest in EB-5 to secure the future of their children,"" said Pathak.Recent developments contributing to widespread concern include the suspension of new F-1 visa appointments, conflict between the Trump administration and Harvard University, stricter F-1 visa regulations, intensive review of students' documentation including social media activity, SEVIS system technical issues, and enhanced scrutiny at entry points.""The F-1 visa, once as a bridge to opportunity, now feels like a tightrope,"" said Akshat Gupta, head of India & UAE, US Immigration Fund (USIF), an EB-5 Regional Centre operator.Since January, USIF has witnessed a 100% increase in F-1 visa holders applying for EB-5 visas compared to 2024.US legal practice Chugh LLP reports a significant increase in EB-5 applications from Indian students holding F-1 visas.Also Read | ‘Sergey Brins of the world came as students..’: Raghuram Rajan warns about risks to US economy if foreign students are curbed by Trump ""Roughly one-third of my new immigration consultations now involve students worried about how US politics could affect their status,"" said Navneet S Chugh, attorney, who runs the firm. The firm's EB-5 enquiries from students have risen from one or two quarterly last year to five to seven monthly this spring.""The Harvard dispute simply reminds them how quickly rules can change,"" said another lawyer.Davies and Associates, a US-based immigration law firm, reports substantial enquiries from Indian students and H-1B visa holders interested in pursuing the EB-5 visa pathway.The processing duration for I-526E applications has reduced considerably compared to previous periods.""In some instances, what once took three years is now being processed in as little as three months,"" said its founder and chairman, Mark Davies. He noted that applicants maintain the freedom to reside and work in the US whilst their Green Card applications are under review.According to Sukanya Raman, country head at Davies and Associates, Green Card holders receive legal safeguards unavailable to F-1 visa students.

Arrears will be paid along with simple interest, based on applicable Public Provident Fund (PPF) rates, reported ANI.The Ministry stated that both physical and online modes of application will be available for claimants. In the physical route, the applicant must visit their respective Drawing and Disbursing Officer (DDO) and submit the required form. The online application process can be completed by visiting official website.The final date to apply for these additional UPS benefits is June 30, 2025, according to the ministry's statement.Meanwhile, the Delhi Government is preparing to enhance the monthly pension for senior citizens and persons with disabilities by ₹500 to provide greater financial support.Earlier this year, the National Statistical Office (NSO) reported that over 6.4 crore new subscribers were added to EPF and ESI schemes between September 2017 and November 2019.

EPFO likely to allow instant PF withdrawals via UPI and ATMs from June 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-likely-to-allow-instant-pf-withdrawals-via-upi-and-atms-from-june-2025/articleshow/121519755.cms,"Instant PF withdrawals under EPFO 3.0

Expanded withdrawal purposes

The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is set to revolutionize the way millions of employees access their provident fund (PF) savings. Starting June 2025, EPF members will be able to instantly withdraw PF funds via Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and ATMs, according to DD News.This major step is being implemented with the support of the Ministry of Labour and Employment and has already received approval from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). The new facility will also allow users to check their PF balance directly on UPI platforms and transfer funds to their bank accounts without delays.Currently, PF withdrawals involve submitting online claims followed by a waiting period for approval from EPFO field offices. This process can take several days or even weeks. However, the upcoming integration with UPI and ATMs is expected to make settlements instantaneous. Members will be allowed to withdraw up to ₹1 lakh instantly—especially helpful in emergencies.“EPFO has made significant improvements in its digital infrastructure by integrating over 120 databases,” said Sumita Dawra, Secretary at the Ministry of Labour and Employment.“These efforts have reduced claim processing time to just three days, with 95 per cent of claims now being processed automatically. Further upgrades are also in progress to make the system even more efficient.”Currently, the EPF scheme allows withdrawals for medical emergencies, housing, education, and marriage, but members must meet specific eligibility criteria and provide proper documentation. With the upcoming changes, the scope of permitted withdrawal reasons will be expanded, giving employees greater financial flexibility for key life events.In another significant development, pensioners under the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) of 1995 will be able to access their pensions from any bank branch across India starting January 1, 2025. This means retirees will no longer be restricted to specific banks or branches.Even if a pensioner relocates or changes banks, pension disbursal will continue seamlessly through the Centralised Pension Processing System (CPPS), eliminating the need to transfer Pension Payment Orders (PPO) between offices.","Starting June 2025, EPF members will be able to instantly withdraw PF funds via Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and ATMs. The new facility will also allow users to check their PF balance directly on UPI platforms and transfer funds to their bank accounts without delays.

NEW DELHI: Goods and services tax (GST) collections rose 16.4% to Rs 2,01,050 crore in May, the fastest pace of expansion since Oct 2022, on the back of a jump in taxes on imports.Latest data estimated that during May (for transactions in April), GST collections from imports rose 25.2% to Rs 51,266 crore, while the mop-up from domestic sources, which is almost three-fourths of the overall kitty, was 13.7% higher at just under Rs 1.5 lakh crore.Imports during April had shot up 19% to nearly $65 billion due to a spike in crude oil and fertiliser shipments, among other things. ""A 16% growth in GST collections shows a renewed upward momentum after few months of growth in the range of 11% to 12%. If the growth continues in this range for next couple of months, it might provide the cushion for govt to look at rate rationalisation on which a lot of work has already been done,"" said Pratik Jain, partner at consulting firm PwC.Last week, govt sources indicated that the finance ministry is working with the states to rationalise GST rates with a review of the slabs on the table. On a net basis, collections were 20.4% higher at Rs 1,73,841 crore as refunds were 4% lower at Rs 27,210 crore, despite domestic refunds soaring 53.7% to Rs 18,314 crore.There was, however, wide variation among the states. Arunachal Pradesh (53%), Nagaland (46%) and Delhi (38%) topped the growth charts, with Tamil Nadu (25%), Kerala (24%), Bihar (23%) and Karnataka (20%) in the middle.At the other end, were Andhra (2% dip), Uttarakhand (13% decline) and Mizoram (26% fall) which reported lower collections.""The average growth across the country does not appear to be uniformly reflected across states, possibly due to sectoral or seasonal factors, which require a deeper data based analysis, said M S Mani, partner for indirect taxes at Deloitte India.","GST collections rose 16.4% to Rs 2,01,050 crore in May, the fastest pace of expansion since Oct 2022.

Bank loans to NBFCs slows sharply,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bank-loans-to-nbfcs-slows-sharply/articleshow/121557368.cms,"MUMBAI: Bank lending to non-banking finance companies slowed sharply in April, with outstanding loans to the sector falling by Rs 25,512 crore to Rs 16.1 lakh crore. At the end of March 2025, bank credit to NBFCs stood at Rs 16.4 lakh crore, marking a modest growth of 5.7% in FY25.This was significantly lower than the overall bank credit growth of 11% during the year, to Rs 182 lakh crore, indicating a cooling in lending appetite toward shadow banks.The slowdown in credit to NBFCs was part of a broader trend. Lending to large industries also moderated in April. The share of loans to large corporates declined to 15% of total bank credit, down from 16% at the end of March 2024. In comparison, housing loans now account for a larger share at 16.6%, underlining the shift in bank lending preferences toward the retail segment. Overall, the industry's share in total bank credit fell to 21.4% from 22% a year ago.Bank loans to individuals against gold jewellery continued to grow adding Rs 3,427 crore during April 2025 taking the total outstanding to Rs 2.2 lakh crore. In FY24, bank loans against jewellery had risen 103% to Rs 2.08 lakh crore a large part of which was due to reclassification of gold-backed agri loans.Data from 41 major scheduled commercial banks, which account for about 95% of all non-food credit, showed that year-on-year bank credit growth stood at 12% in the fortnight ended March 21, 2025.This was lower than the 16.3% growth recorded in the same period last year, reflecting a broad deceleration in credit expansion.Credit to agriculture and allied activities grew by 10.4% in March 2025, compared to 20% in the corresponding period last year. Lending to industry rose by 8%, the same as the previous year. While sectors such as petroleum, metal products, engineering, and construction saw higher credit offtake, lending to infrastructure slowed. The services sector also saw a deceleration, with credit rising by 13.4%, down from 20.8% a year earlier. This was mainly due to a sharp slowdown in bank loans to NBFCs, although credit to professional services and trade remained robust.In the personal loan segment, growth eased to 14% from 17.6% in the previous year. The deceleration was mainly due to lower growth in vehicle loans, credit card outstandings and other personal loans, indicating a cooling in consumer demand for credit.","Bank lending to non-banking finance companies slowed sharply in April.

What has the revamping of old planes, especially the wide bodies, taken longer than originally anticipated?

Why does on time performance (OTP), again particularly for long hauls on wide bodies, remain a challenge?

Overall are you satisfied with the pace of change at AI Group?

Are you having a relook at your tie-up with Turkish Technic following the country’s role during Operation Sindoor?

Backgrounder: Turkish Technic, a subsidiary of Turkish Airlines, is a maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) for commercial aircraft, engines, and components with facilities in Istanbul and Ankara. India has revoked the security clearance for Turkish ground handling company Celebi and barred it from Indian airports. IndiGo has been asked to wrap up its wet lease arrangement with Turkish Airlines following Turkey’s support to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.

IndiGo is wet leasing planes to launch long hauls. What do you feel about the wet lease policy?

As AI changes, what are the other aviation ecosystem aspects that need to change too?

What are some other issues that need to be tackled in Indian aviation?

NEW DELHI: Tata Motors shed its “taxi” image after the acquisition of UK’s JLR when it started to churn out world class cars. The much-loved Vistara’s merger into Air India could prove to be a similar moment for Air India as the Maharaja has crossed more than half way of the transition to a much better airline that was promised when Tatas took over AI and AI Express in Jan 2022. In a freewheeling interview, AI MD & CEO Campbell Wilson spoke discusses the airline’ revamp, the IndiGo wet lease controversy and regulatory challenges. Excerpts:We are getting the ordered new planes, including Boeing 737 MAX for AI Express and will get a B787 & Airbus A350 for AI this fiscal. So they are coming. But they are later than we had originally contracted to receive them for reasons Boeing and Airbus can tell you. Depending on the 6 to 12 months (delay), this is a little bit frustrating for all involved, including the original equipment manufacturer. But it's an industry issue.The other thing that has caused challenge to the original timelines is the certification, production and installation of business class seats in particular on the legacy aircraft. So, the refit programmes which we had hoped to have largely completed by now on the wide body fleet are still underway.Narrow body progress is going well, with 65% of the work done and we should essentially complete by the end of this calendar year. We have decided to retain 13 old A320s for longer than usual which will be upgraded next year. Wide body refit of the B787 starts in July. For B777s, the refresh has started and refit will happen next year. Revamp of both the (777 & 787) should be complete by the end of 2027.OTP of international flights on wide body fleets remains is improving significantly. It’s not where we want it to be. There are a few reasons for that. The aircraft were terribly neglected, not well maintained and have old components. They hadn't kept paced with the advances in technology. All of that needed to be replaced and upgraded. It is taking time, particularly because of supply chain constraints. But technical despatch reliability of aircraft has gone materially up. Has it reached the global average? In some cases, yes. But in most cases, no, because there is still more work to do.Then you layer on efficiency of systems. It required replacing the IT which has started to happen. There were several other issues which are being taken care of, including AI not recruiting people for 20 years before privatisation. The staff not being exposed to contemporary best practices. People had been promoted because of tenure, not talent. That had needed to be changed. That takes time.Ans: We’ve completed the merger of four airlines. We finished the year with an OTP that was higher than Vistara. The financial trajectory, particularly for the full service carrier, is going very well. New Air India is in service to New York and to London with the A350. Passengers are very pleasantly surprised on what we are delivering on that.The best aircraft are deployed on the metro-metro routes and the rest of the aircraft are nearing upgradation. Maintenance base is being constructed. We have a training academy now seeing 2,000 people being trained and upgraded today. We have a building in which we're currently installing first of 22 flight simulators. We have broken ground on the flight training school. We've got a school for engineers to be trained. All of the foundation pieces that are necessary to build the future Air India are either in place or coming up. We’ve achieved a lot and there's clear evidence that things are on the right track.Ans: We are reviewing our agreement with Turkish Technic where we send some of our wide bodies for checks. It takes some time to adjust when the situation changes. But we are aware of the national sentiment and what people expect us to do. We will look to recalibrate where we send our aircraft. We are looking at options to send our planes for maintenance repair and overhaul.”There’s a place for wet lease for short-term capacity augmentation. (However) it can be abused in terms of duration. It can be abused in terms of circumventing air traffic rights between countries. Ultimately, it's something that regulator needs to have a view on.Though the ecosystem here is not mature, it is fast getting better. We (AI) were part of the cause of the problem too. As we get better they can get better. With the sheer number of aircraft that are coming into Indian skies, there needs to be a change in air traffic management; use of airspace; spacing between aircraft and efficiencies of routing. I'm not saying it's bad, but we're probably not going to be able to cope with a quadrupling of the number of aircraft flying in Indian skies.Look at the block time (when an aircraft starts moving to when it comes to a halt) of Delhi-Mumbai 10 years ago and today. (It’s the same if not increased) Today’s aircraft fly faster. What's causing the congestion? That that will get worse if the system is not debut toned.There needs to be more investment on customer experience, particularly the transit experience, both domestic to international, also International-international.International lessors have concerns over the way operating leases are taxed. The French OEMs are concerned about the way MFN status of tax treaties is being interpreted. As a result, they load up the price to Indian lessees which raises the cost for Indian operators. Which raises the price for Indian passengers.","Air India CEO Campbell Wilson talks about the airline's revamp. He also discusses the IndiGo wet lease controversy and regulatory challenges. Wilson says the Vistara-Air India merger is going very well. The airline is working on revamping its wide body fleet, he says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121557254,imgsize-61698,width-400,resizemode-4/121557254.jpg"

CLSA has an outperform rating on Bajaj Auto with the target price at Rs 10,149. Analysts said that in the Jan-March quarter, the two-wheeler major's EBITDA margin was flat on a quarterly basis and in line with the estimates, its revenue growth was led by increase in volumes and price increase, led by product mix.

Economists say slowing growth and contained inflation leave room for further easing in monetary policy.India's GDP growth slowed to 6.5% in FY25 from 9.2% the previous year, though the March quarter saw a better-than-expected print of 7.4%. Inflation, meanwhile, remains within the RBI's 4% target. In April, RBI reduced its repo rate - the rate at which it lends to banks - by 25bps (100bps = 1 percentage point) to 6%.""We do believe that given the rather benign inflation conditions and the liquidity situation which has been made very comfortable through various measures of RBI, the MPC would go in for a 25bps cut in the repo rate on June 6,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda. He added that the central bank is also expected to revise its forecasts for growth and inflation and offer an assessment of global risks, particularly the impact of the upcoming expiry of the US tariff reprieve in July.A Prasanna of ICICI Securities also expects a 25bps cut, saying the robust Jan-March GDP growth confirms the case for moderate easing. ""A preference for cuts in 25bps clips and accommodative stance means the MPC is well positioned to react to any data surprises on either side,"" he said.He noted that RBI has already eased financial conditions by ensuring abundant liquidity. RBI has done this by pumping in rupee liquidity and by avoiding the usual borrowing that it does from money market to absorb surplus funds from banks.Barclays economist Aastha Gudwani noted that Q1 growth beat expectations, with GDP (gross domestic product) and GVA (gross value added) driven by a pickup in manufacturing and robust capital expenditure, even as consumption remained weak. ""Full-year growth has come in at 6.5%,"" she said.Crisil expects RBI to cut rates by another 50bps this fiscal, citing favourable macroeconomic tailwinds such as expectations of an above-normal monsoon and subdued global crude prices. The IMD forecast of 106% of the long period average for the monsoon is likely to support kharif output, boost rural demand, and keep food inflation in check.

Tit-for-tat tariffs: It’s been a bumpy road

So, what went wrong between the US & China this time?

US President Donald Trump claims he was a ‘Nice Guy’ with China - that he helped China out of a ‘devastating’ situation when the world’s second largest economy was in ‘grave economic danger’. But, China ‘violated’ its agreement with the US, Trump has said in his latest social media post on the Truth Social. Trump’s latest salvo against China comes as no surprise for experts, who have come to accept Trump’s ‘flip-flops’ as a reality.Two weeks ago, the US and China announced reaching an agreement for a temporary 90-day reduction in their tariffs, following discussions between senior officials in Geneva. The United States decided to temporarily decrease its additional tariffs on Chinese goods from 145 percent to 30 percent. In response, Beijing implemented a corresponding reduction, bringing down its additional tariffs from 125 percent to 10 percent.US tariffs continue to be elevated, incorporating a 20 percent duty that the Trump administration recently applied to Chinese products, citing concerns about Beijing's supposed involvement in illegal drug trafficking - an allegation that China has firmly disputed.But things seem to have gone down hill again since then.Trump’s social post reads, “Two weeks ago China was in grave economic danger! The very high Tariffs I set made it virtually impossible for China to TRADE into the United States marketplace which is, by far, number one in the World. We went, in effect, COLD TURKEY with China, and it was devastating for them. Many factories closed and there was, to put it mildly, “civil unrest. ” I saw what was happening and didn’t like it, for them, not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”Trump has always called China the ‘biggest abuser’ on tariffs. On April 2, also called the ‘Liberation Day’ by Trump, the US President announced sweeping tariffs on most major economies, with China getting hit with 34% tariffs (plus 20% existing tariff). China had retaliated strongly by raising its own tariffs and the situation had quickly escalated to a level where Trump eventually imposed 245% reciprocal tariffs on China.Also Read | Big embarrassment!

In the past Trump administration officials have said that China is wielding its market supremacy as a strategic tool, necessitating immediate US action.Global markets went into a tailspin following the trade war between the US and China and the 90-day truce between the world’s two largest economies had brought a sense of relief - albeit fragile!Trump's statement lacks details regarding China's specific violations of the Geneva, Switzerland agreement and does not outline his intended response towards Beijing.A US official informed Reuters that China appeared to be delaying the issuance of export licences for rare earth minerals.US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC that China had not fulfilled its Geneva commitments. He said, ""The Chinese are slow-rolling their compliance, which is completely unacceptable and it has to be addressed.""Greer indicated that China's supply of critical minerals, previously stopped due to Chinese trade countermeasures, had not resumed as stipulated in the Geneva agreement.Earlier, in a Fox News interview, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessen had t indicated that negotiations with China regarding trade matters were ""a bit stalled.""Also Read | ‘Overstepped his authority…’: What are the scathing observations made by US trade court in ruling against Donald Trump’s tariffs?

Will Trump Be Forced To Refund?

Tariff Impact: $34 billion losses and counting…and counting..

What will happen if the US trade court ruling against American President Donald Trump ’s reciprocal tariffs is upheld? If that happens, it could necessitate the Trump administration to refund billions in import duties that have already been collected!On Wednesday, the US Court of International Trade (CIT) panel, comprising three judges, determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) did not authorise Trump to implement extensive tariffs or circumvent Congress's traditional authority over economic and commerce policies.Trump had referenced this 1977 legislation to validate most of his tariff implementations, particularly those announced on ""’Liberation Day’ in early April.According to a NewsWeek report, Todd Tucker, a trade specialist from the Roosevelt Institute in New York, shared on BlueSky on Thursday: ""This will do tremendous damage to Trump's agenda. His whole second term seemed to be DOGE, deport, and (trade) deals."" He further questioned: ""On trade, in particular, why would any country waste time negotiating to lower his tariffs if he can't impose them in the first place?""The government has lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit, describing the CIT's decision as a ""judicial coup."" Experts suggest alternative methods remain available for Trump to implement his trade policies in response to the ruling.The NewsWeek report said that if the ruling is upheld it could mean the Trump administration will have to reimburse the substantial import duties already collected. Whilst The Kobeissi Letter assessed collected tariff revenue at $10 billion since April 2, Newsweek's examination of Treasury Department records indicates potentially larger amounts.Also Read | ‘Work of fiction…’: Will Donald Trump bury US government in debt with multitrillion-dollar tax breaks? Even Elon Musk is concerned ""I think that the court's order should lead CBP (US Customs and Border Protection) to suspend liquidation of entries going forward, which would mean that if the court's decision is ultimately upheld, importers can get their money back,"" stated William Reinsch, who served as under secretary of commerce for export administration during the Clinton administration and led the National Foreign Trade Council from 2001 to 2016.Importers, including American companies and overseas exporters who are bound by contract to pay import duties, might qualify for refunds. However, according to Reinsch's statement to Newsweek, consumers are ""probably not"" likely to receive any refunds following the CIT's ruling, despite having paid higher prices for imported products in recent months.""The people who paid the tariffs—the importers—might get their money back, but they would not be obligated to pass that on to consumers, although some might choose to do so as a matter of goodwill,"" he explained. He further expressed doubt about the success of any potential legal action by consumers against the government for compensation.According to the report, legal experts suggest that importers could potentially take legal action against the administration for goods that have already cleared customs procedures.The administration under Trump has recognised its obligation to reimburse specific tariff payments in cases where duties are subsequently eliminated or reduced. Following a decision in late April that determined certain tariffs should not be 'stacked' or applied cumulatively, Trump issued an executive order stating this would have retroactive application to particular tariffs. The order also confirmed that reimbursements for those who had paid increased import duties would be handled according to existing laws and standard CBP refund procedures.When announcements were made regarding exemptions to Trump's reciprocal tariffs, similar details were provided. The CBP has also issued instructions detailing how importers can seek refunds for duty payments on items where tariffs were later withdrawn or decreased.Also Read | ‘Went COLD TURKEY, it was devastating for them…’: Donald Trump slams China for ‘violating’ trade agreement with US - what went wrong this time? Meanwhile, corporate disclosures reveal that Trump's trade policies have resulted in companies losing more than $34 billion through decreased sales and increased expenses, as per Reuters' evaluation. This impact is likely to grow as businesses struggle with uncertainty surrounding tariffs, affecting operational decisions at major global corporations.Prominent organisations across three continents have seen significant setbacks. Notable examples include Apple, Ford, Porsche and Sony, which have either withdrawn or substantially reduced their profit projections. Most companies indicate that the unpredictable implementation of Trump's trade measures has rendered precise cost calculations unfeasible.The combined total of $33 billion represents calculations from 32 S&P 500 firms, three STOXX 600 enterprises and 21 Nikkei 225 organisations. According to financial experts, the actual business impact is expected to significantly exceed the currently reported figures.""You can double or triple your tally and we'd still say ... the magnitude is bound to be far greater than most people realize,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, professor at the Yale School of Management, according to the Reuters report.The broader implications could prove more severe, Sonnenfeld noted, pointing to possible reductions in consumer and business expenditure, alongside heightened inflation projections.Also Read | ‘Even if we lose…’: Donald Trump administration readying two-part strategy to impose reciprocal tariffs, says ‘we will do it another way’","US Court of International Trade (CIT) panel determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) did not authorise Trump to implement extensive tariffs.

The falling oil prices, influenced by US President Donald Trump 's policies and OPEC+'s increased output quotas, have pushed crude costs to their lowest since the Covid pandemic, benefiting consumers whilst creating challenges for producers.Brent North Sea crude currently trades below $65, significantly lower than the $120 peak witnessed in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The declining oil prices have helped reduce global inflation and stimulated growth in oil-importing nations, particularly in Europe. In the US, the consumer price index dropped 11.8 percent year-on-year in April.As Pushpin Singh, an economist at Cebr explained, reduced crude prices enhance consumers' ""discretionary items"" spending capacity. The Brent price decrease of over $10 from last year has lowered various fuel costs, potentially reducing consumer goods prices through decreased transportation and manufacturing expenses.While Trump's trade policies have influenced oil prices, the overall impact on inflation remains uncertain due to potential increases in other resource costs. Singh also noted that lower oil prices could diminish the appeal of renewable energy investments.Oil-producing nations face significant challenges, particularly high-cost producers who must reduce production, according to Ole Hansen from Saxo Bank. Shale producers are especially vulnerable when prices approach $60, with some firms already reducing investments in the Permian Basin.OPEC+ members show varying resilience to low prices. Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait maintain substantial monetary reserves, whilst Iran, Venezuela, and Nigeria face greater economic pressures due to limited borrowing capacity.Eight major OPEC+ members, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, announced on Saturday their plans to substantially increase crude oil output for July. The coalition's statement confirmed they would maintain the previously established target of 411,000 barrels per day, which was also set for May and June. This revised production target represents more than three times the volume originally proposed by the alliance.Read more: OPEC+ announces major July output hike as oil prices fall to four-year low The recent OPEC+ decision to production by 411,000 barrels daily appears aimed at disciplining quota-breaching members, whilst responding to Trump's pressure for lower prices.

What White House and Donald Trump have said

Elon Musk’s apprehensions & disappointment

Rising US national debt

‘Work of fiction’

US President Donald Trump is not finding it easy to convince multiple stakeholders, including the Republican senators and international investors that his ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ won’t bury the US government in a huge pile of debt. So much so that one of his biggest supporters, Tesla CEO Elon Musk , has also expressed concerns about the impact of the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package.Financial markets have responded with doubt, even as the Donald Trump administration continues to struggle to demonstrate effective deficit reduction strategies.""All of this rhetoric about cutting trillions of dollars of spending has come to nothing — and the tax bill codifies that,"" said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank, according to an Associated Press report. ""There is a level of concern about the competence of Congress and this administration and that makes adding a whole bunch of money to the deficit riskier. ""The Trump administration has responded aggressively towards critics expressing worry about increasing debt under the new US President’s leadership, despite evidence of rising debt levels following his 2017 tax reductions during his first presidential term.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt in her briefing earlier this week attempted to address what she termed as inaccurate assertions regarding the tax reductions.Leavitt criticised the assessment that the 'One, Big, Beautiful Bill' would increase the deficit, dismissing the Congressional Budget Office's analysis and other evaluators' projections, stating they employ unreliable assumptions and have consistently failed at forecasting across both Democratic and Republican administrations.Also Read | ‘Went COLD TURKEY, it was devastating for them…’: Donald Trump slams China for ‘violating’ trade agreement with US - what went wrong this time? However, Trump's own statements have indicated that the insufficient spending reductions to balance his tax cuts were a result of maintaining unity within the Republican congressional group. ""We have to get a lot of votes,"" Trump stated last week. ""We can't be cutting.""The Trump administration seems to fervently be relying on economic growth as the primary solution, a strategy that receives limited support outside Trump's immediate circle.The White House Council of Economic Advisers believes that their policies will generate substantial growth, leading to reduced annual budget deficits in proportion to the overall economy, thereby establishing fiscal sustainability for the US government.The council projects economic growth averaging 3.2% annually over the next four years, contrasting with the Congressional Budget Office's 1.9% forecast, and estimates creating or preserving up to 7.4 million jobs.Most economic experts regard the non-partisan CBO as the authoritative source for policy assessment, though it doesn't evaluate costs for executive branch actions, such as Trump's independent tariff decisions.Expressing his concerns, technology magnate Elon Musk, who previously served in Trump's close circle as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, shared his views with CBS News: ""I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.""Soon after his take on the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’, Musk also announced his exit from Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency. In an official statement, Musk conveyed his appreciation to Trump for the chance to head DOGE, stating, ""As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President Donald Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.

UK boosts weapons production capacity in new defence strategy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-boosts-weapons-production-capacity-in-new-defence-strategy/articleshow/121547206.cms,"Representative Image

LONDON: Britain will invest £1.5 billion ($2 billion) in new weapons factories to ramp up defence production capacity, the government said on Saturday, ahead of a major review of its armed forces and military strategy.The Strategic Defence Review, due to be published Monday, will assess the threats facing the UK amid Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and pressure from US President Donald Trump for NATO allies to bolster their own defences.In February, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer committed to increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2027, up from its current 2.3 percent.The Labour leader also aimed to hike spending to three percent by the next parliament, due around 2029.The review will recommend ""creating an 'always on' munitions production capacity in the UK"" which would allow weapons production to be ""scaled up at speed if needed"".It also urges the government to ""lay the industrial foundations for an uplift in munitions stockpiles to meet the demand of high-tempo warfare"", the Ministry of Defence said in a statement.The government has said it would procure 7,000 domestically built long-rang weapons and build ""at least six munitions and energetics factories"".This investment -- which will see £6 billion spent on munitions this Parliamentary term -- will also create and support 1,800 jobs, the ministry said.""The hard-fought lessons from Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine show a military is only as strong as the industry that stands behind them,"" Defence Secretary John Healey said.""We are strengthening the UK's industrial base to better deter our adversaries and make the UK secure at home and strong abroad.""Healey also told The Times newspaper that Britain would spend three percent of GDP on defence during the next parliament.The government has said it would cut the UK's overseas aid budget to help fund the spending.The defence review, led by former NATO secretary general George Robertson, warns that Britain is entering ""a new era of threat"" as drones and artificial intelligence transform modern warfare, The Guardian newspaper reported Saturday.The document will warn of the ""immediate and pressing"" danger posed by Russia, as well as focusing on China, Iran and North Korea.Robertson has described the four countries as a ""deadly quartet"" which were ""increasingly working together"".The government this week pledged over £1 billion for improving battlefield technology by bolstering AI and cybersecurity.In that announcement Healey warned that ""ways of warfare are rapidly changing"" and that the UK was ""facing daily cyber-attacks on this new frontline"".mhc-aks/srg/rmb",Britain will invest $2 billion in new weapons factories to ramp up defence production capacity.

Higher steel tariffs to dent exports as companies look at other markets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/higher-steel-tariffs-to-dent-exports-as-cos-look-at-other-markets/articleshow/121544545.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

NEW DELHI: Doubling of import duty on steel and aluminium by the Trump administration will dent export demand, with companies having to scout for alternative markets.Several US importers have gone slow on fresh orders as costs went up significantly after the imposition of 25 per cent duty, although India was not seen to be worse off, given that the same duty applies to all countries. But if Trump decides to move ahead with his threat, several American firms will have to slow down production as such duties are seen to be unviable and unsustainable. This will also reduce demand for inputs.""The economic impact will be significant. US steel prices are already high, at around $984 per metric tonne - far above European prices at $690 and Chinese prices at $392. The doubling of tariffs is expected to push US prices to about $1,180, squeezing US domestic industries such as automotive, construction, and manufacturing that depend on steel and aluminium as key inputs. These sectors may face hundreds of dollars in additional material costs per tonne, driving up prices, reducing competitiveness, and risking job losses or inflationary pressures,"" said trade research body GTRI.Fieo chief S C Ralhan said the increase in tariffs would have a significant bearing on India's steel exports, especially in semi-finished and finished categories like stainless steel pipes, structural steel components, and automotive steel parts.These products are part of India's growing engineering exports, and higher duties could erode our price competitiveness in the US market.EEPC India president Pankaj Chadha said, ""It's unfortunate that while bilateral trade talks are going on between India and the US, such unilateral tariff increases have be done. It only makes the work of negotiators more complicated.""Last fiscal, India exported steel and finished products of $6.2 billion to the US and about $0.9 billion of aluminium and its products. The US is among the top destinations for Indian exporters, who have been increasing market share through high-quality production and competitive pricing, Fieo said.","Several US importers have gone slow on fresh orders as costs went up significantly after the imposition of 25 per cent duty.

Donald Trump announces 50% tariff on steel imports from June 4 to 'secure industry in US',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-announces-50-tariff-on-steel-imports-to-secure-industry-in-us/articleshow/121526245.cms,"US President Donald Trump speaks at US Steel Corporation's Mon Valley Works-Irvin plant, Friday, May 30, 2025, in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania (AP Photo)

US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he is doubling the tariff on steel imports to 50 percent, a big increase that could raise prices for steel, which is used in housing, cars, and other products.""We're going to bring it from 25 per cent to 50 per cent, the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry,"" Trump said.Trump said he had a ""major announcement"" as he spoke at US Steel’s Mon Valley Works–Irvin Plant in West Mifflin, US state of Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, to talk about investments by Japan’s Nippon Steel.""Nobody's going to get around that,"" he added during the speech in front of workers in a state that helped him win the 2016 election.Trump said US Steel will remain an American company under a deal where Japan-based Nippon Steel will invest in the company. Few details about the deal have been shared.""We’re here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,"" Trump said at an event in one of US Steel's warehouses near Pittsburgh. ""You're going to stay an American company, you know that, right?""He said doubling the tariffs on steel imports ""will even further secure the steel industry in the US.""But this large increase could cause prices to rise more.Trump later posted on social media that the higher tariff rate would take effect on June 4.""It is my great honor to raise the Tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%, effective Wednesday, June 4th. Our steel and aluminum industries are coming back like never before. This will be yet another BIG jolt of great news for our wonderful steel and aluminum workers. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.Workers, Trump supporters, local officials, and others gathered in a large warehouse at the Irvin plant to hear Trump speak. American flags hung from the ceiling, and a sign read ""The Golden Age."" Steelworkers wore orange hard hats and work clothes, and large coils of steel made at the plant filled part of the warehouse floor. The steel is used for appliances, doors, and other products.At first, Trump promised to block the Japanese company’s attempt to buy US Steel, but last week he announced a deal for Nippon Steel to have ""partial ownership."" It is not clear if the deal is finalized or how the ownership will be arranged.Trump said he considered a 40 per cent tariff, but industry leaders asked for 50 per cent.""At 25 per cent they can sorta get over that fence,"" Trump said. ""At 50 per cent nobody’s getting over that fence.""On March 12, Trump imposed 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. This led to immediate retaliation from Canada and complaints from the US auto industry. The European Union also responded with tariffs but later removed them.During his speech on Friday, President Donald Trump also spoke about the agreement he approved, allowing Japan’s Nippon Steel to acquire a controlling stake in US Steel.Earlier, during his presidential campaign, Trump had opposed the idea of US Steel being sold to a foreign company. At the time, it was one of the few issues he agreed on with President Joe Biden, who had blocked the deal, calling it a threat to national security.On Friday, however, Trump said he eventually supported the deal after being convinced that Nippon Steel could help preserve US Steel and protect its workers.""US Steel was being sold into foreign hands with no protections for our great steel workers,"" Trump said. ""And I said there’s no way we’re gonna let that happen. I was watching over you.""Trump said that executives from Nippon and US Steel continued to meet with him to discuss the sale, and he kept turning it down until the proposal included better terms. A major reason he accepted the revised deal, he said, was the inclusion of a so-called golden share, which gives the US government a say in how the company operates.""They kept asking me and I kept rejecting them: No way, no way, no way,"" Trump said. ""Every time they came in, the deal got better and better and better for the workers.""""I’m going to be in Washington; I’m gonna be watching over it,"" Trump added.With the increase in steel tariffs and the finalized Nippon deal, Trump said that workers at US Steel now had reasons to feel hopeful. He invited several workers on stage who shared concerns about the decline of the American steel industry and thanked Trump for his actions.""This is going to be a very big day,"" Trump said. ""This is going to be one of the biggest days in your life.""","US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he is doubling the tariff on steel imports to 50 percent.

Despite the day’s dip, the market remained on track to close out what could be its best month since November 2023.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% in morning trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 13 points, or less than 0.1%, as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%.Shares of Gap Inc. dragged on the market, plunging 21.1%, even after the retailer reported better-than-expected profit and revenue. The company, which owns Banana Republic and Old Navy, warned that tariffs on imports from China and other nations could add up to $300 million in costs this fiscal year. While Gap has plans to mitigate about half of that impact, the warning spooked investors.Markets have spent much of the week reacting to the latest developments in the White House’s tariff policy. Earlier optimism that Trump’s tariffs might be easing helped fuel a rally, especially after a U.S.court blocked many of the levies on Wednesday. That helped push the S&P 500 toward its first winning month in four and potentially its strongest since late 2023.However, the situation remains uncertain. The White House is appealing the U.S. Court of International Trade’s ruling, keeping many of the tariffs in place for now. Tensions flared again Friday morning after Trump accused China of failing to uphold its end of the tariff pause agreement. “So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” he posted on Truth Social.The comments briefly rattled markets, but futures soon stabilized. Many analysts believe Trump may seek alternative legal routes to continue applying tariff pressure.Trump argues that tariffs are essential to revitalizing American manufacturing, even if households and businesses feel short-term pain. The uncertain outlook has already prompted some companies to pull back. American Eagle Outfitters, for example, withdrew its financial forecast for 2025, citing economic ambiguity. Its stock fell 1.4% after it reported a steeper-than-expected quarterly loss.On the upside, Ulta Beauty shares surged 14.8% after reporting strong sales and raising its full-year revenue outlook, despite describing the business climate as “fluid.” Costco also edged higher, climbing 3.7%, after beating earnings expectations.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers rocketed 69% after surprising investors with a quarterly profit, while SharpLink Gaming extended its meteoric rally, rising 19.5% on Friday to bring its weekly gain to 1,308%. The marketing company, which connects consumers to sportsbooks and casino platforms, announced a $425 million plan to invest in Ethereum-based cryptocurrency ventures.Meanwhile, bond markets were calm. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.40% from 4.43%, while the two-year yield held steady at 3.92%, reflecting investor expectations that the Federal Reserve may hold rates steady for a while longer.A separate report from the University of Michigan showed that consumer sentiment improved slightly in May, especially after Trump paused many of his proposed tariffs on China. Still, Americans remain anxious. “Overall, consumers see the outlook for the economy as no worse than last month, but they remained quite worried about the future,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the Survey of Consumers.The Fed has so far held its benchmark borrowing rate steady in 2025 after a round of cuts late last year. Officials have indicated they want more time to assess the inflationary impact of tariffs before making further decisions.Global markets showed mixed movement. In Europe, France’s CAC 40 rose 0.3%, Germany’s DAX climbed 0.8%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 added 0.6%.In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.2% to 37,965.10 after inflation data from Tokyo showed core prices rising faster than expected, fueling speculation that the Bank of Japan may raise interest rates.Australia’s ASX 200 gained 0.3%, while South Korea’s Kospi slipped 0.8% ahead of next week’s presidential election. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 1.2% and China’s Shanghai Composite shed 0.5%.The trade court’s ruling applies only to some tariffs, leaving those on steel, aluminum, and automobiles—enacted under a different law—unaffected. On Thursday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit allowed the president to continue collecting the contested tariffs temporarily while the case proceeds.In energy markets, US crude dipped 7 cents to $60.87 per barrel, while Brent crude fell 10 cents to $63.25. In currency trading, the US dollar weakened to 143.68 yen from 144.12 yen, and the euro edged down to $1.1344 from $1.1367.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% in morning trading.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online. “Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN



NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"" If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-100810085,imgsize-36192,width-400,resizemode-4/100810085.jpg"

"Gold, silver outlook for Diwali 2025: How high could prices go after 50% surge? Analysts weigh in",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-silver-outlook-for-diwali-2025-how-high-could-prices-go-after-50-surge-analysts-weigh-in/articleshow/124309463.cms,"AI image used for representative purposes

As Diwali 2025 approaches, gold and silver markets have shown remarkable performance, with increases of over 47% and 52% respectively this year. On the MCX, prices have exceeded Rs 1,18,000 per 10 grams, leading investors to speculate about further growth potential during the upcoming festive period.Analysts, quoted by Economic Times, predict continued growth, with gold potentially reaching Rs 1.22 lakh by Diwali. Market participants are keeping a close watch on global cues and domestic demand trends as the festival approaches.The 2025 precious metals surge has been driven by various factors including festival demand, accommodative central bank policies, global political tensions and sustained ETF investments, leading to unprecedented price levels.Silver prices have also risen significantly, trading above Rs 1.44 lakh per kg, with projections suggesting Rs 1.50 lakh by the festival period.Renisha Chainani of Augmont Research anticipates a ""bullish-to-consolidation phase"" during Diwali, noting that whilst recent gains might encourage profit-taking, the overall positive trend continues. ""Gold has surged past Rs 1,18,000 on MCX while silver trades above Rs 1,44,000, supported by safe-haven demand amid the US government shutdown, tariff uncertainty, and expectations of further Fed rate cuts,"" Chainani told ETMarkets.Regarding Diwali 2025 projections for precious metals- Chainani forecasts that by October 21, gold could reach $3950-$4000 internationally (Rs 1,20,000-Rs 1,22,000 on MCX), while silver might achieve $49-$50 (Rs 1,48,000-Rs 1,50,000), particularly if global tensions increase. She notes that ""key drivers of bullishness include dovish Fed policy, a weaker US dollar, continued ETF inflows, and robust Indian festive demand. ""The industrial sector and green energy requirements could boost silver demand. However, she notes that market stabilisation could occur due to profit collection, US dollar strengthening, or reduced global tensions.Manoj Kumar Jain from Prithvifinmart Commodity Research notes that September's performance, with gold increasing over 10% and silver 15% internationally, indicates a ""super bull run"" for both metals. Additionally, his predictions include gold reaching Rs 1,22,000 by Diwali and Rs 1,25,000 by year-end, with silver potentially hitting Rs 1,50,000 and Rs 1,58,000-Rs 1,60,000 respectively.Internationally, Jain anticipates gold at $3940-$4000 and silver at $48.40-$50 per troy ounce. Support levels are $3720 (international) and Rs 1,10,660 (domestic) for gold, with silver at $44.40 and Rs 1,34,400. Jain recommends: ""We suggest buying gold and silver on dips for the target of Rs 1,22,000 and Rs 1,50,000, respectively and avoid any kind of short selling in both precious metals.""As Diwali approaches, jeweller and retail demand is expected to increase. Traditional peak buying during festivals and weddings could further strengthen prices already elevated by global economic uncertainties.Despite potential profit-taking opportunities, analysts maintain that fundamental factors remain positive, with any price decreases likely being temporary.Jigar Trivedi of Reliance Securities said, ""By Diwali 2025, gold may trade around Rs 1,19,000-Rs1,20,000/10g, driven by global uncertainties, central bank buying, high inflation, Fed stance and a weaker rupee. Safe-haven demand is strong as geopolitical tensions and economic slowdown fears persist.""He adds that silver might reach Rs 1,48,000-Rs 1,50,000/kg, supported by industrial applications, particularly in solar energy and EVs, alongside investment interest. ""Supply constraints and a falling rupee further fuel price momentum. With interest rates expected to fall globally, precious metals may gain. However, high volatility and profit-booking can cause short dips. Overall, both metals show a bullish outlook for Diwali 2025 in rupee terms, supported by macroeconomic trends, weak INR, and robust investor interest in hard assets,"" Trivedi further added.","Gold and silver markets have shown remarkable performance, with increases of over 47% and 52% respectively this year. On the MCX, prices have exceeded Rs 1,18,000 per 10 grams, leading investors to speculate about further growth potential during the upcoming festive period.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124309738,imgsize-130875,width-400,resizemode-4/i-compose-opulent-gold-and-silver.jpg"

"Bitcoin reaches all-time high! Largest crypto surpasses $125,000 mark; 'debasement’ trade spurs risk rally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bitcoin-reaches-all-time-high-largest-crypto-surpasses-125000-mark-debasement-trade-spurs-risk-rally/articleshow/124317019.cms,"



Bitcoin soared to a new all-time high on Sunday, breaking past the $125,000 mark as safe-haven demand surged.The world’s largest cryptocurrency reached $125,689 in Asia, driven by investor concerns over the US government shutdown. The cryptocurrency smashed its previous record of $124,514 set on August 14, boosted by gains in US stocks and fresh inflows into Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded funds.Investors believe that the government shutdown, which began on Wednesday, could push money into safe-haven assets, a trend market participants are calling the “debasement trade.”“With many assets including equities, gold and even collectibles like Pokemon cards hitting all time highs, it’s no surprise Bitcoin is benefitting from the dollar debasement narrative,” Joshua Lim, co-head of markets at crypto prime brokerage firm FalconX told Bloomberg.October is traditionally a strong month for Bitcoin, often referred to as “Uptober,” with the token gaining in nine of the past ten years. The surge this year has lifted Bitcoin’s value by more than 30%.The rise has also been fuelled by growing corporate adoption. Public companies, led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, have been stockpiling Bitcoin, a move that has inspired other firms and even boosted interest in smaller digital assets like Ether.US equities hit record highs on Friday, driven by major artificial intelligence deals and partnerships, easing concerns about a prolonged shutdown and weak business activity.Meanwhile, treasuries and the dollar fell, and gold was on track for a seventh consecutive weekly gain, supported by central bank buying amid low interest rates and persistent inflation worries.“The shutdown matters this time around,” said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Plc, as quoted by Bloomberg.He added that Bitcoin is likely to rise during this period and noted that the cryptocurrency was “in a different place” during the previous shutdown in 2018-2019, when it did not move in line with traditional risk assets.","World's largest cryptocurrency smashed its previous record of $124,514 set on August 14.

MUMBAI: From smartphones priced over Rs 20,000 to large TV sets, washing machines, premium furniture and AI appliances, Indians splurged on big-ticket purchases and upgrades this Navratri-Dussehra season, keeping up with the premiumisation trend that has been defining festive shopping for quite some time now.Savings made from GST reductions have only allowed more people to expand their budgets and shop across categories, whether or not they have been covered under the ambit of lower taxes.Sales of mass apparel and footwear, segments that have been sluggish for several quarters, picked up as well as GST cuts made products more affordable for the middle class. For retailers and consumer goods companies, the initial issues with regards tothe implementation of GST cuts on the ground has also eased, helping sales, executives said.""Consumers needed time to absorb what the changes in tax meant for pricing and purchase decisions. Once these gains were understood clearly, however, we started observing a strong pick-up. From Dussehra onwards, sales have risen significantly by 15-20%, driven in large part by the effective price relief afforded by the tax cuts. The impact price point for us remains in the range of Rs 1000-Rs 3000, the (price) band that has displayed maximum traction,"" Anupam Bansal, MD at Liberty Shoes, told TOI.AC sales have fared ""exceedingly well"" and the momentum will continue till Diwali, said B Thiagarajan, MD at Blue Star, adding that more people are showing an inclination to shift to 5-star ACs from 3-star.AC sales will pick up further once the weather becomes conducive for purchases, said Nilesh Gupta, director at Vijay Sales, which has seen a 20% year-on-year growth in sales this festive period.""The sales have been bumper this year. Large TVs did very well and so did washing machines. TVs saw volume growth of 10%-12% which is very good because the segment had been slow,"" Gupta said. Among durables, ACs, TVs above 32 inches, and dishwashers have benefited from lower GST cuts.For the appliances business of Godrej Enterprises Group, Navratra sentiments have been better in non-metro markets - registering close to 30% growth over last year, while metros have shown about 12% growth in the same period.""The trend is seen almost across categories, including ACs, which have had price reductions owing to GST but not limited to ACs. Washing machines is an exception which showed strong growth in excess of 30% in both segments with higher growth in the metro territories. The good growth in AC in non-metros can be attributed partially to GST reduction given that festive is not a peak AC selling season,"" said business head & EVP Kamal Nandi. Navratri sales hit a decade high this year on GST cuts, TOI had reported.At Interio by Godrej, the premium segment grew by nearly 10% over last year, said EVP and business head Swapneel Nagarkar. ""While GST implications for the furniture industry remain unchanged, we observed a notable shift in consumer spending toward categories such as automobiles and premium appliances,"" said Nagarkar.Premiumisation remained a defining trend at Amazon. Smartphones above Rs 20,000 grew 50% year-on-year, lifting overall category ASPs by 30%.Fashion retailer Libas recorded a 40-50% growth in sales over last year.","From smartphones to washing machines, Indians splurged this Navratri-Dussehra season.

BENGALURU: India's IT services sector is unlikely to post strong results for the September 2025 quarter. While Q2 is typically the best-performing quarter, Investec expects divergent results across companies as macroeconomic uncertainty, tariff risks, and client caution continue to affect discretionary spending.Both brokerages - Kotak Institutional Equities and Motilal Oswal Financial Services - expect modest sequential growth for Tier-I players in the quarter, while mid-tier firms are set to outperform. Kotak estimates revenue growth for Tier-I companies will range between 0.2% and 2%, with Infosys expected to lead at 2% quarter-on-quarter growth, followed by HCLTech at 1.7%. TCS and Wipro are forecast to trail, reporting around 0.2% growth each.Motilal Oswal projects similar trends, with Infosys likely to post 2.4% sequential growth, HCLTech at 1.7%, TCS at 1%, Wipro at 0.3%, Tech Mahindra at 1%, and LTIMindtree at 2%. Mid-tier companies, however, are expected to deliver stronger momentum. Kotak sees Coforge leading with 6% growth, followed by Persistent Systems at 4%. Motilal Oswal also highlights Coforge at 6%, Persistent at 3.7%, and Hexaware at 3.3% as strong performers, aided by ramp-ups of large cost-saving and consolidation deals.According to Investec, the September quarter is expected to show divergent performances across IT majors. Infosys, HCLTech, and Tech Mahindra are likely to deliver relatively stronger growth (in that order), while TCS and Wipro may report weaker results.Among tier-2 firms, Persistent, LTIMindtree, and Mphasis are expected to lead growth, with Zensar, LTTS, and KPIT facing headwinds - particularly from softness in the auto, manufacturing, and technology, media, and telecom (TMT) segments.Margins are expected to remain steady, supported by rupee depreciation, but analysts caution that pricing pressures, wage costs, and the deflationary impact of generative AI (GenAI) will limit gains.""GenAI is currently deflationary to the extent of 2-3%, especially in coding, summarisation, and contact-centre BPO,"" Kotak noted, adding that its long-term impact on IT budgets remains uncertain.Across verticals, the BFSI segment is expected to remain resilient, while auto and retail continue to face headwinds from tariffs and margin pressures.Engineering, research and development (ER&D) firms are likely to post another soft quarter, particularly those exposed to automotive clients, though a pick-up is expected in the second half as delayed projects resume.","Investec expects divergent results across companies as macroeconomic uncertainty, tariff risks, and client caution continue to affect discretionary spending. Kotak estimates revenue growth for Tier-I companies will range between 0.2% and 2%.

"'US tariffs: Uncertainty bigger than Covid, financial crisis'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-tariffs-uncertainty-bigger-than-covid-financial-crisis/articleshow/124327870.cms,"Representative image

What do you make of current global situation in the wake of the tariffs and trade restrictions?

‘U.S. Tariffs Unfair, Actively Working To Resolve Trade Issues’: EAM Jaishankar

As someone who's based in Beijing, how is China negotiating the challenge? It has much more leverage than, say, India?

Are you seeing greater trade diversion from China, which is a big worry?

How successful has this diversification been and which countries have benefited? India was hoping to be a gainer...

Given the value chains and cost advantages in developing countries, how successful will be US' strategy to use tariffs for reshoring?

Indian companies have been very focused on the domestic market. Do you see that changing? Is there a need to change the high tariff structure in India?





NEW DELHI: Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank chief economist Erik Berglof says that US tariffs have created more uncertainty than the Covid pandemic or the global financial crisis and argues that global supply chains are here to stay. Excerpts from an interview with TOI:It creates a lot of uncertainty globally, and in individual countries. Unfortunately, India is one of the countries that has been most affected by this. The policy uncertainty, which is unprecedented, is even bigger than it was during Covid and the global financial crisis. It will have very significant costs for investment and trade, and the overall impact on economic growth will be significant. We are getting some uncertainty resolution, which is good. But we still have some way to go. It's very hard to predict how the US-China relationship is going to play out. But what is clear is that we globally will end up with much higher tariff levels.The Chinese government was very well prepared. They had been expecting this. As you said, they have significant leverage in some areas and that has helped balance the conversation.Unfortunately, there is a lot of delay in the data, particularly on investment and what's happening to global value chains and so on. But we are still talking more about adding countries to the value chain rather than completely changing the value chains and certainly not shortening them in near-term. So, from a Chinese perspective, this is not yet such a big deal. What they do worry about is that some of this is being used to push China out of value chains. That's where they have pushed back. With India, there are some examples where China has been quite a tough negotiator to make sure that bilateral negotiations between US and individual countries don't affect China. When I look at the outcome, this is still under control. There are some movements to Vietnam, to India. China plus one is still the predominant pattern.India has for some very significant parts. What Apple and Foxconn have done, for example. There are a number of companies that have come to India. Not because of what's happened with the US, but companies and countries have looked at how to diversify their value chains. But it's not so easy because these value chains are driven by very strong efficiency pressures, and they have over a long time worked up very close relationships within these value chains.If you look at what's happened to global value chains over the last 20-30 years, it's a remarkable shift away from advanced economies to emerging economies. So many countries, particularly countries in Asia, have been able to join these value chains because of this fragmentation that allows you to enter with even a very small part of the value chain if you can live up to the standards. These global value chains will be very robust. It's half of world trade and it's there to stay. It's a huge opportunity for India to join these value chains and also create its own value chains.India is a very large and rapidly growing market. So, companies show a lot of interest in India, both Indian and foreign. My expectation is that India will become more integrated, particularly within Asia. In the medium run, it is important for India to open up and make Indian companies more integrated, more interested in some of the collaborations within Asia. Obviously, you need to be sensitive to the needs of the farmers and the rural economy, but there can be a lot of benefits for India.",Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank chief economist Erik Berglof says that US tariffs have created more uncertainty than the Covid pandemic or the global financial crisis. He argues that global supply chains are here to stay and that India has a huge opportunity to join these value chains.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124327920,imgsize-1324952,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-57.jpg"
Alternatives to OTPs will make payments safer: Visa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/alternatives-to-otps-will-make-payments-safer-visa/articleshow/124327796.cms,"AI image





MUMBAI: RBI 's move to get merchants to store tokens instead of card data since 2022 has cut down frauds and improved transaction success rates. Now, allowing alternatives to one-time passwords (OTP) for authentication is expected to make the system more efficient.Speaking to TOI, Visa's head of products and innovation for South Asia, Ramakrishna Gopalan, said the payments giant has developed Visa Payment Passkey as an alternate form of authentication.""OTPs have served India well but have limitations such as delays, delivery failures, and vulnerability to phishing,"" Gopalan said. ""RBI's new framework allows interoperable alternatives, opening space for faster and more secure authentication methods. Visa's response is Visa Payment Passkey, based on the global FIDO (Fast Identity Online) standard. It eliminates passwords and OTPs by enabling biometric and cryptographic verification. ""Consumers can authenticate payments across devices using fingerprints or facial recognition. ""In markets where Passkey is live, fraud rates are nearly 50% lower than OTP-based methods,"" he said, adding that while OTPs will not disappear overnight, there will be a gradual shift toward ""more seamless and secure identity-based authentication.""Gopalan said RBI's principle-based approach ""ensures inclusiveness and flexibility."" ""It doesn't prescribe one method but allows consumers to choose what suits them best. For many, OTPs will remain familiar and convenient; for others, biometric options will be faster and safer. Banks can layer additional checks like device data or transaction history to strengthen risk management while maintaining ease of use,"" he said.On tokenisation, Gopalan called India's shift from card numbers to tokens three years ago ""a landmark move unmatched in scale globally."" ""By Sept 2022, the entire ecosystem had transitioned. India now has nearly a billion tokens, with more than 500 million on Visa's network,"" he said.""Tokenisation has improved security, reduced fraud risk, and enhanced consumer confidence. A key benefit has been a 3-4% improvement in transaction success rates because users no longer need to re-enter details at checkout, reducing drop-offs."" He noted that fraud patterns are shifting ""from large-scale database breaches to social engineering scams,"" and said Visa uses AI-based systems like Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager to analyze every transaction in real time.Visa is also promoting mobile-based tap-and-pay and low-cost POS devices for small merchants. ""These devices are lightweight and affordable, making them ideal for small businesses,"" Gopalan said.Looking ahead, Visa plans to launch Visa Flex Credential, linking credit, debit, and prepaid sources to a single credential. It is also preparing for a future where ""AI agents will conduct transactions autonomously"". ""India's regulatory and infrastructure framework has created a payments ecosystem that is both innovative and secure,"" Gopalan said.""As new authentication and tokenisation layers continue to evolve, India is setting global benchmarks in digital payments.""","RBI's move to get merchants to store tokens instead of card data since 2022 has cut down frauds and improved transaction success rates.

MUMBAI: After briefly catching up with credit growth, bank deposit growth has again begun to lag advances. Early business updates from banks for the September quarter show a mixed trend, with some lenders-such as HDFC Bank-deliberately slowing credit expansion to maintain balance sheet stability.According to RBI data, deposits of scheduled commercial banks grew 10.4% at the end of the first quarter, while credit rose 11%. In the preceding quarter, deposit growth stood at 10.3% versus 10.4% for credit.Provisional figures filed by banks show that for Bank of Baroda and Kotak Bank, growth in advances continues to outpace deposit mobilisation, while for HDFC Bank and Yes Bank deposits are the focus of growth. IndusInd Bank was an outlier, reporting declines in both deposits and advances.HDFC Bank reported period-end deposits of Rs 28lakh crore as of September 30, up 12.1% year-on-year, while advances under management grew at a slower 8.9% to Rs 28.7lakh crore. The bank's gross advances stood at Rs 27.7lakh crore, up 9.9% year-on-year.Kotak Mahindra Bank reported robust double-digit growth, with deposits rising 14.6% to Rs 5.3 lakh crore and advances up 15.8% to Rs 4.7 lakh crore.Among public sector lenders, Bank of Baroda's global deposits grew 9.3% year-on-year to Rs 15 lakh crore, while global advances increased 11.9% to Rs 12.8 lakh crore, taking its total global business to Rs 27.8 lakh crore-up 10.5% over the previous year.IDBI Bank saw deposits rise 9% to Rs 3 lakh crore and advances grow 15% to Rs 2.3 lakh crore, resulting in a 12% increase in total business to Rs 5.3 lakh crore. Yes Bank reported moderate growth, with deposits at Rs 3 lakh crore, up 7.1% year-on-year, and loans at Rs 2.5 lakh crore, up 6.5%. Its CASA deposits grew 13.2% to Rs 1 lakh crore, improving its funding mix.IndusInd Bank's deposits fell 5% year-on-year to Rs 3.9 lakh crore, while net advances declined 8% to Rs 3.3lakh crore. The bank's CASA ratio was 30.8%.The data shows the challenge banks continue to face in mobilising low-cost deposits after a 100 basis point cut in interest rates by the RBI.With lending continuing to grow faster than deposits, competition for funds is likely to keep deposit rates sticky in the coming quarters."," deposits of scheduled commercial banks grew 10.4% at the end of the first quarter.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the 14th round of talks for India-EU FTA in Brussels on Monday, the EU has said that the negotiating teams are working hard to deliver a mutually beneficial deal, even as negotiations are challenging and important issues need to be resolved.Talking about the significance of India-EU economic partnership, EU ambassador Herve Delphin also said EU companies in India generated a total turnover of 186 billion euros in 2024, around 5% of the Indian economy, and exported goods worth 23.5 billion euros, which accounts for around 6% of total Indian exports of goods.He said the EU and India are also negotiating an Investment Protection Agreement that aims to create a predictable, secure and transparent environment for EU and Indian investors, thus helping to generate the higher levels of FDI needed for the Indian economy.""While certain differences must still be resolved, both EU and India agree on key principles: that the right of states to regulate must be explicitly safeguarded and that there must be clear guidance for tribunals on how to interpret investment protection standards. These shared principles should guide us throughout the negotiating process towards a successful outcome,"" he said.The ambassador said that the 13th round of FTA talks last month did not result in the sort of breakthrough which was expected.""The EU was and is still ready to conclude on a meaningful package. We look forward to the next round and further negotiations towards a mutually beneficial deal,"" he said.""The FTA can open new opportunities for EU and Indian businesses and create conditions to significantly increase our bilateral trade and investment. While some countries are raising tariffs or otherwise closing their markets, we should use the FTA to diversify trade, hedge against uncertainties and strengthen our supply chains,"" said Delphin.""The EU is India's top trading partner, with bilateral trade in goods of EUR 120 billion, ahead of the US and China. Adding services, our bilateral trade has reached EUR 180 billion. This is an impressive figure, but there is a huge potential for growth considering that the EU and India are the 2nd and the 4th largest economies in the world.

As Commerce and Industry minister Piyush Goyal is set to begin his two-day visit to Doha from October 6, India and Qatar are expected to finalise the terms of reference (ToR) for a proposed free trade agreement (FTA) this week.According to the trade policy think-tank GTRI report, India–Qatar trade stood at $14.15 billion in FY 2025, heavily skewed toward energy imports. India ran a $10.78 billion trade deficit, with petroleum crude and gas products accounting for nearly 90% of imports. Key imports included liquefied natural gas ($6.39 billion), liquefied butanes ($1.67 billion), liquefied propane ($1.54 billion), and petroleum crude ($1.06 billion).India exported $1.68 billion to Qatar, led by iron and steel ($154 million), basmati rice ($123 million), and gold and precious metal jewellery ($110 million). Non-energy imports, including fertilisers, chemicals, plastics, and aluminium, totaled $1.24 billion, reflecting only 11% of total imports.""The evolving India–Qatar partnership reflects a pragmatic convergence of needs — Qatar’s quest for diversified security and investment partners and India’s pursuit of stable energy supplies and regional influence.While trade remains heavily dominated by hydrocarbons, both countries recognize the need to broaden cooperation into new sectors such as chemicals, fertilizers, metals, and engineering goods. "" Founder of GTRI, Ajay Shrivastava noted in a report.""Unless trade is balanced, prereferral trade agreement giving concessions on petrochemicals may not be in India’s favour. Joint ventures in energy infrastructure, technology collaboration, and cross-border investments can help reduce India’s trade deficit and reinforce Qatar’s role as a trusted long-term partner. As global power dynamics shift toward a multipolar order, a stronger India–Qatar axis promises mutual resilience, economic complementarity, and greater strategic autonomy for both nations. "" Ajay Srivastava noted.The report notes that the September 2025 Israeli airstrike in Doha highlighted Qatar’s need to diversify partnerships, and India is seen as a stable, reliable partner in Asia, offering energy security, strategic access, and a market for industrial goods. Over 800,000 Indians working in Qatar further strengthen people-to-people links and remittance flows.The GTRI report highlights that while energy are bedrock of India–Qatar trade, both countries recognise the need for broader diversification. The report recommends expanding imports in chemicals, fertilisers, and metals to reduce hydrocarbon dependence, boosting exports of engineering goods, machinery, and value-added food products, and exploring joint ventures in energy infrastructure and technology collaboration to lower the trade deficit and reinforce strategic ties.","India–Qatar trade stood at $14.15 billion in FY 2025, heavily skewed toward energy imports.

The Dubai Fountain: Largest choreographed fountain in the world









After five months of intensive redevelopment, the Dubai Fountain is set to officially reopen on Wednesday, October 1, 2025. Emaar has confirmed the date and shared details about a thorough two-phase upgrade designed to boost the fountain’s performance, technology, and overall visitor experience. With a revamped infrastructure, state-of-the-art robotics, and refreshed visuals, the iconic Downtown Dubai attraction is ready to return bigger and better than ever. Visitors can look forward to smoother, more precise shows featuring enhanced lighting, sharper choreography, and stunning water displays that promise to captivate both longtime fans and first-time viewers alike.The Dubai Fountain will resume operations on Wednesday, October 1, following a complete five-month shutdown that began on April 19, 2025. While speculation had circulated on social media in the weeks leading up to the confirmation, developer Emaar officially announced the reopening on September 27.The first show marking the grand return is scheduled for 6:30 PM on October 1. Regular showtimes will resume as follows:The reopening marks the completion of Phase One of the redevelopment project. Phase Two, introducing additional new features, is scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2026.The first phase involved a full-scale shutdown of the attraction, during which the entire 30-acre Burj Khalifa Lake was drained. This enabled major structural work, including:This deep structural work was essential to ensure both performance reliability and long-term maintenance efficiency, while preserving the fountain’s original grandeur.During this five-month closure, the site remained accessible visually. Emaar installed 500 metres of high-definition digital screens along the Dubai Mall promenade. These screens showcased looped archival footages of past performances in sync with the visuals of Burj Khalifa light displays, maintaining a sense of continuity and visitor engagement despite the ongoing construction.The redevelopment is more than cosmetic—it represents a fundamental reengineering of how the Dubai Fountain operates.Key upgrades now integrated include:These changes aim to deliver smoother motion, richer sensory experience, and overall improved show reliability. The system is designed to require less maintenance, reducing potential downtime in the future.Despite all the upgrades, the iconic identity of the Dubai Fountain remains intact, with water jets spraying up to 22,000 gallons of water as high as 150 metres into the air at any given time, illuminated by 6,600 lights and 25 colour projectors, all now performing on a more resilient and technologically advanced platform.The work isn’t fully complete. Emaar confirmed that the reopening marks only the end of the first phase. Phase Two, expected to conclude by Q2 2026, will introduce additional technological features and creative enhancements.While specific elements of the second phase are still under wraps, Emaar has emphasized that it will combine creativity and next-generation technology to continue evolving the fountain experience and deliver “fresh moments of wonder.”Mohamed Alabbar, Founder of Emaar, described the reopening as a symbolic moment for Dubai:The Dubai Fountain, originally launched on May 8, 2009, remains the largest choreographed fountain in the world, stretching 275 metres across the manmade lake beneath the Burj Khalifa. Designed by WET Design, the same creators behind the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas, it has long been a centrepiece of Downtown Dubai’s global allure.Now, with an entirely upgraded infrastructure and advanced show capabilities, it’s ready to reclaim its place in the city’s cultural spotlight—offering both returning and first-time visitors a renewed experience that blends technology, spectacle, and architectural ambition.The wait is over.

Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other members of Opec+ on Sunday decided to raise their oil production quotas by 137,000 barrels per day (bpd) for November, continuing efforts to reclaim market share amid cautious demand projections, AFP reported.“In view of a steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories, the eight participating countries decided to implement a production adjustment of 137 thousand barrels per day from October’s levels,” Opec+ said in a statement after an online meeting.The increase was lower than many analysts had anticipated, with the group seeking to avoid exerting downward pressure on prices amid weak global demand. “Opec+8 stepped carefully after witnessing how nervous the market had become in light of rumours that production could be hiked by 500,000 barrels a day,” said Jorge Leon, analyst at Rystad Energy. “The group is walking a tightrope between maintaining stability and clawing back market share in a surplus environment. ”Since April, the eight members — Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Oman, and Algeria — have already raised their quotas by more than 2.5 million bpd.The initial focus of Opec+ this year was to support high prices by limiting supply, but the strategy shifted in April to prioritise regaining market share from competitors including the US, Brazil, Canada, Guyana and Argentina.Global oil demand projections are modest. The International Energy Agency expects consumption to rise by only 700,000 bpd between 2025 and 2026, while Opec forecasts higher growth of 1.3 million bpd in 2025 and 1.4 million bpd in 2026.Brent crude, the global benchmark, traded below $65 per barrel on Friday, down about 8% in a week amid concerns over a potential surge in Opec+ production.Russia, the cartel’s second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia, relies on high oil prices to fund its war effort in Ukraine but has limited capacity to increase output due to US and European sanctions. “The increase decided Sunday is manageable for Russia,” said Leon. The country currently produces around 9.25 million bpd, close to its maximum capacity of 9.45 million bpd, down from roughly 10 million before the conflict, analysts said.Ukrainian strikes on Russian refineries since August have intensified exports, as domestic utilisation of crude has declined, making Russia even more dependent on foreign markets, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, analyst at Global Risk Management","Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other members of Opec+ on Sunday decided to raise their oil production quotas by 137,000 barrels per day for November.

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report





The Indian diaspora is actively discussing the first lawsuit filed recently against President Trump’s proclamation, which has slapped an entry fee of $ 100K on all new H-1B visa petitions filed after the specified date of September 21.Also read: Cross section of organisations sue to halt Trump’s $100K entry fee for new H-1B applications In social media forums, the Indian plaintiff who is a party to the first lawsuit to challenge the entry fee is being hailed as a hero for stepping forward to challenge Trump’s proclamation. The clock is ticking for this post-doctoral researcher at a US university, as her employer has paused her H-1B cap-exempt sponsorship.As TOI had reported earlier, while the entry fee kicks in for new H-1B cap applications in the next lottery season (Spring 2026), the immediate impact will be felt by those employers (such as Universities, non-profit entities affiliated with universities, non-profit research organisations) that are eligible to hire cap-exempt employees – many of whom cannot afford this steep fee.Also read: Relief for current H-1B employees but a blow to future hiring She is one of the many plaintiffs, others include a cross section of organisations representing health care providers, academicians, educational institutions, and religious organisations. The only other individual who is contesting this joint lawsuit is a UK national.The woman has filed the lawsuit under a pseudonym ‘Phoenix Doe’. She has been identified in the lawsuit only as “a citizen of India residing in the Northern District of California”.Her work explores the genetic and epigenetic causes of vision loss from ageing, diabetes and rare inherited disorders, aiming to improve diagnosis and treatment of blinding conditions.According to the lawsuit, she is the lab’s first post-doctoral scholar and is critical to building its research programme; her project requires at least two more years. Valued for her combined expertise in computational biology and bench research, she had been approved for H-1B sponsorship and expected to finalise the process by December — which would have allowed her to visit India for the first time in six years.Instead, the university has indefinitely paused her H-1B application, leaving her in limbo. In the lawsuit, she submits that the uncertainty has caused her severe stress and anxiety, aggravating her post traumatic stress disorder. Without judicial relief she will have to leave her position within four months. Her exit, it points out, would derail crucial eye-disease research, disrupt the lab’s funding prospects and delay progress toward new treatments.The lawsuit submits that by slapping an unlawful $100K price tag on every new H-1B petition, the government has effectively barred many US employers from sponsoring foreign professionals like her.The Indian plaintiff’s ordeal is emblematic of the toll the proclamation and shifting immigration policies take on families and communities.The lawsuit seeks an injunction halting the fee’s enforcement, a declaration that the order is unlawful, and a return to the original statutory H-1B framework (without imposition of the entry fee).The case has drawn attention in India — home to the largest share of H-1B talent — as it could determine whether professionals like the unnamed plaintiff can continue contributing to the US workforce without prohibitive costs hanging over their visas.","The Indian diaspora is actively discussing the first lawsuit filed against President Trump’s proclamation, which has slapped an entry fee of $ 100K on all new H-1B visa petitions filed after the specified date of September 21.

French automaker Renault is planning to reduce about 3,000 jobs through a voluntary redundancy programme for staff in support function; Reuters reported on Saturday citing French newsletter L'Informe.The cost-cutting initiative, named ""Arrow,"" targets human resources, finance, marketing, and other support services, aiming to lower staff numbers by roughly 15% at its headquarters in Boulogne-Billancourt near Paris and at other global locations.A source cited by the newsletter said a final decision on the job cuts could be made by the end of the year.Renault confirmed it is exploring cost-reduction measures but stressed that no final figures have been decided.“Given the uncertainties in the automotive market and the extremely competitive environment, we confirm that we are considering ways to simplify our operations, speed up execution, and optimize our fixed costs,” a company spokesperson told Reuters.At the end of 2024, Renault employed 98,636 staff worldwide. The carmaker reported a first-half net loss of €11.2 billion ($13 billion) in July, which included a €9.3 billion write-down on its partner Nissan. Excluding the write-down, net income fell to €461 million, less than a third of the previous year, reflecting challenges in the van market, electric vehicle costs, and rising commercial pressures, analysts said.Renault CEO Francois Provost, appointed in July after Luca de Meo left for Gucci-owner Kering, has to restore margins, secure investment-grade credit, and counter US tariffs and Chinese market pressures, analysts say.","French automaker Renault is planning to reduce about 3,000 jobs through a voluntary redundancy programme.

Netflix vs Elon Musk: Streaming platform shares fall 5% in a week; here's why Tesla CEO is not watching it anymore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/netflix-vs-elon-musk-streaming-platform-shares-fall-5-in-a-week-heres-why-tesla-ceo-is-not-watching-it-anymore/articleshow/124318838.cms,"Why Is Musk Calling For Boycott Of Netflix?

Why is Musk not watching Netflix?

Profits





Shares of streaming platform Netflix have tumbled almost 5% over the past 5 trading sessions ever since Tesla CEO Elon Musk has started urging his followers to boycott the company and cancel their subscriptions.Netflix shares fell on Friday, marking their biggest weekly decline since April, even as the broader market rallied. Though major indices rose about 2% to new highs, the streaming giant lagged behind tech peers like Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META), according to Yahoo Finance.Musk has used his platform on X to call on consumers to cancel their Netflix subscriptions, criticising the company for including alleged transgender messaging in children’s programming.This week, Elon Musk urged his followers to cancel their Netflix subscriptions amid a controversy surrounding an animated show and its creator.Musk posted on X, “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids.” His post responded to an image claiming Netflix was promoting a “transgender woke agenda.”The backlash centres on the animated Netflix series Dead End: Paranormal Park, which featured a transgender character and was cancelled in 2023 after two seasons.In addition to sharing several anti-trans posts, Musk also reacted to a post criticising alleged statements by the show’s creator, Hamish Steele, which a prominent conservative X account said “mocked” the murder of activist Charlie Kirk.The post came after Libs of TikTok shared screenshots from a Netflix report showing a rise in non-white directors and lead actors across its programmes.Netflix is preparing to release its third-quarter earnings later this month. The short-term effect of the boycott may be hard to gauge, as the company no longer reports subscriber numbers every quarter.In its most recent report, Netflix beat Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year revenue forecast. The company expects third-quarter revenue of $11.53 billion and earnings per share of $6.87, above analysts’ initial estimates. For the full year, Netflix now projects revenue between $44.8 billion and $45.2 billion, boosted by ad-supported tier growth, favourable foreign exchange movements, and steady user engagement.Executives have said ad sales are on track to roughly double to $3 billion next year, with new seasons of hit shows such as Wednesday, Stranger Things, and Squid Game, alongside expanded live sports offerings, expected to maintain momentum.Netflix has weathered similar controversies in the past. In 2020, the film Cuties sparked bipartisan outrage over alleged sexualisation of children, leading to a surge in cancellations. Yet the company managed to maintain its subscriber base and continued growing in the following years.","Netflix shares fell on Friday, marking their biggest weekly decline since April.

H-1B visa fee hike: Businesses warn changes would harm US economy; urge Trump admin for employer friendly reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/h-1b-visa-fee-hike-businesses-warn-changes-would-harm-us-economy-urge-trump-admin-for-employer-friendly-reforms/articleshow/124315755.cms,"H-1B Visa Shock Explained: $100K Annual Fee Announced by Donald Trump





Business groups have raised concerns over US President Donald Trump ’s decision to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, warning that the move could hurt the US economy. They also called on the administration to avoid changing the skilled worker program that would add even more burden to companies.In a letter to Donald Trump on Friday, nearly a dozen trade associations representing chipmakers, software firms, and retailers warned that the hefty fee could disrupt a crucial flow of foreign talent and leave essential positions vacant.“We ask the administration to work with industry on necessary reforms to the H-1B visa program without increasing the significant challenges US employers face recruiting, training, and retaining top talent,” they wrote.The signatories included the Business Software Alliance, SEMI, the National Retail Federation, the Entertainment Software Association and the Information Technology Industry Council, according to Bloomberg.The letter came two weeks after Trump’s proclamation on H-1B changes and also acknowledged his efforts to boost investment in the US.The H-1B fee announcement marked one of the first major confrontations between the new administration and corporate America.Trump unveiled the change at the White House last month, saying the hefty charge would curb misuse of the visa programme and encourage companies to rely more on American workers.A White House spokesperson defended the decision, claiming it would strengthen the programme by allowing companies to hire top talent and reducing “fraudulent practices by bad-faith actors.”“Widespread visa abuse not only undermines American workers, but undermines the companies” that need to recruit first-class talent, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, as quoted by Bloomberg.Sharp rise in costs will hit sectors ranging from technology and healthcare to finance, where companies such as Microsoft, Amazon and Walmart have long depended on foreign professionals to fill technical roles.They warned that fast-growing fields like artificial intelligence and biomedical engineering rely on highly skilled workers to maintain their pace of development. Members of SEMI’s board include Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics, Applied Materials and KLA.“The new approach to H-1B visas, as it stands, will harm the Administration’s goals to ensure the US remains a leader in AI, revitalizes manufacturing growth, and propels US-developed energy,” the letter said, as cited by Bloomberg.Retail giants Walmart, Target and Macy’s are represented on the NRF’s executive committee and board. Following the announcement, several large companies advised H-1B visa holders not to travel abroad to avoid complications.Copies of the letter were also sent to homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and secretary of state Marco Rubio.The policy faced its first legal challenge on Friday, when a nurse-staffing agency and several unions filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block the fee. Hospitals say that the visa programme is vital for recruiting doctors in rural areas that struggle with shortages. Meanwhile, the administration has said that doctors may qualify for exemptions from the new charges.","Business groups have raised concerns over US President Donald Trump ’s decision to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications.

US government to auction 600 million tonnes of coal: Who will buy? Climate concerns also loom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-government-to-auction-600-million-tonnes-of-coal-who-will-buy-climate-concerns-loom/articleshow/124308141.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

Who will buy the coal?





In the coming days, US authorities will conduct the nation’s largest coal auctions in over a decade, offering 600 million tonnes from state-owned reserves adjacent to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming. The leases, located in the Powder River Basin—the country’s most productive coal region—were expedited following a January executive order by President Donald Trump.While the auctions align with Trump’s goal of increasing coal extraction from federal lands for power generation, an Associated Press analysis shows that many power stations served by these mines plan to stop using coal within a decade.The forthcoming sales will go ahead despite the government shutdown, as workers handling fossil fuel permits and leases are exempt from furlough. Then-President Biden had attempted to block future coal leases in the region last year, citing climate change concerns. According to the Department of Energy, burning coal from these leases could generate over 1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide.Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced that more than 20,000 square miles of federal lands would be opened for mining—an area larger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.The administration has also reduced federal coal royalty rates, extended a Michigan coal plant’s operation, and allocated $625 million for plant modernisation, citing rising electricity demand from AI and data centres. ""We're putting American miners back to work,"" Burgum said. ""We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.""The key question remains: who will actually purchase this coal? Data from the US Energy Information Administration and Global Energy Monitor indicate declining demand for the mines slated for expansion or new leases, as power stations reduce coal consumption or plan to cease operations entirely.The administration’s aggressive push for coal—a major driver of climate change—raises pressing questions. It also points to the uncertainty of implementing such policies in markets where energy producers make long-term decisions with significant consequences, not only for their own operations but for the planet’s future, amid a constantly shifting political landscape.Montana and Wyoming sales were requested by Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC), which acquired several Powder River Basin mines in a 2019 bankruptcy auction. These mines supply 34 power stations across 19 states, but 21 of these stations plan to stop using coal within a decade, including all five served by NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.In government filings, NTEC valued 167 million tonnes of federal coal near Spring Creek at around $126,000—less than one-tenth of a penny per tonne, far below historical prices. NTEC justified the low valuation, citing forecasts of declining coal demand:""The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints.""The government will auction 440 million tonnes near NTEC's Antelope Mine in central Wyoming on Wednesday. Over half of the 29 power stations served by this mine plan to cease coal use by 2035, including Colorado’s Rawhide plant, which is scheduled to switch from coal to natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar power by 2029.Peabody Energy, the largest US coal company, offers a more optimistic outlook. They estimate coal demand could increase by 250 million tonnes annually, nearly 50 per cent above current levels, citing delays in new nuclear and gas facilities. ""US coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" said Peabody president James Grech. ""The US has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.""Energy specialists remain sceptical. Umed Paliwal, an electricity market specialist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said:""Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market. The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.""No major coal power stations have opened in the US since 2013, and most existing facilities are over 40 years old. Experts suggest the administration’s $625 million modernisation fund may be insufficient, with a single boiler component costing up to $25 million, according to GridLab energy consultant Nikhil Kumar.","US authorities will conduct the nation’s largest coal auctions in over a decade.

Billion dollar boost loading? Why Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl album may be just what US Fed & Powell needed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/billion-dollar-boost-loading-why-taylor-swifts-the-life-of-a-showgirl-album-may-be-just-what-us-fed-powell-needed-explained/articleshow/124294382.cms,"The Life of a Showgirl (Image courtesy: Taylor Swift Instagram)

Taylor Swift’s new album - Booster shot loading for the US economy?

US Federal Reserve’s challenges





The US economy is faced with the twin conundrum - growth challenges are mounting, and inflation is not in the US Federal Reserve’s comfort zone. At such a time, the release of Taylor Swift ’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, may spell good news for the central bank!Now, what does the release of a music album by a famous singer have to do with the economic decisions of the US Federal Reserve and its chair Jerome Powell? Confused? We explain.Taylor Swift has released her latest studio album, marking her twelfth record. Should this launch lead to another extensive concert tour, it would positively impact the economic objectives of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and fellow policymakers.According to a report by Barron’s, the last time Taylor Swift did a mega-tour, it resulted in a possible boost for the US economy. The economic influence of the Eras Tour, comprising 149 performances across five continents, remains challenging to quantify precisely. Nevertheless, various analyses indicate substantial economic effects. Nomura's economists calculated that the initial US portion of the tour stimulated consumer expenditure of $5 billion, including ticket sales and accommodation costs, the Barron’s report said.The Life of a Showgirl was unveiled early Friday. According to music analytics platform Chartmetric, the album achieved an unprecedented milestone by surpassing 5 million pre-saves on Spotify.Those attempting to capitalise on the release through stock investments might face disappointment, the report said. Universal Music Group, which owns Swift's label Republic Records, receives a portion of streaming and publishing earnings. However, the company's potential earnings might be restricted as Swift maintains ownership of her master recordings.Despite Target keeping numerous stores open until midnight for fans to purchase both regular and exclusive CD versions, their shares increased by merely 0.1% on Friday. The S&P 500 index recorded a 0.2% rise.However, Barron's report notes that the market cannot disregard The Life of a Showgirl entirely. The crucial consideration for investors centres on whether Swift will launch another extensive tour following this album.A multi-billion dollar economic stimulus, brought on as a result of a mega tour like last time, would be beneficial in the current climate, the report said.With employment figures declining whilst inflation exceeds 2%, the Federal Reserve faces significant challenges. Market analysts anticipate the central bank will implement interest rate reductions this month, followed by additional cuts in December, aiming to support employment levels.“The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen,” the FOMC statement said.Should The Life of a Showgirl generate a touring schedule comparable to Eras, Powell may have Swift to thank!","Taylor Swift has released her latest studio album, marking her twelfth record.

US stocks continued to climb on Friday, as Wall Street edged toward the finish of another record-setting week, buoyed by optimism around artificial intelligence and hopes of easier interest rates despite a partial government shutdown.The S&P 500 rose 0.2% and is on track for its seventh winning week in nine, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 167 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.2%, AP reported. All three indexes came off all-time highs set the previous day.Trading may see increased volatility later in the session as reports on the US services sector are released. Treasury yields in the bond market were largely steady ahead of the data.Normally, the first Friday of the month draws attention to the US government’s monthly jobs report, which details hiring and unemployment trends. But the third day of the partial shutdown has delayed the release, leaving investors and policymakers without fresh employment data.Past shutdowns have typically had limited impact on markets and the economy, though President Donald Trump has threatened large-scale firings of federal workers this time.Investors remain focused on AI-related developments, which have propelled the market in recent weeks. The sector received a boost after Japan’s Hitachi signed a memorandum of understanding with OpenAI, following similar agreements with South Korean firms. Hitachi’s stock surged 10.3% in Tokyo, while US tech giants Nvidia and Broadcom rose 0.6% and 1.5%, respectively.However, caution persists over the sector’s rapid growth, with some analysts warning of a potential bubble that could disappoint investors. Applied Materials was among the day’s losers, dropping 2.5% after warning of a roughly $110 million revenue impact in Q4 due to expanded US export restrictions on certain Chinese customers.Global markets were mixed, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 1.9%, while European indexes showed varied performance. In the US bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield inched down to 4.09% from 4.10% late Thursday.","The S&P 500 is on track for its seventh winning week in nine.

The United States has delayed the release of a key employment report as a partial government shutdown entered its third day on Friday, creating uncertainty over the state of the world’s largest economy.Other economic indicators scheduled for publication this week, including weekly unemployment claims, have also been postponed, depriving policymakers and businesses of crucial information for decision-making, AFP reported.The shutdown has already led to hundreds of thousands of federal employees being sent home without pay across multiple agencies. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that approximately 750,000 employees could be furloughed daily if funding lapses continue.The US labor market has been under close scrutiny in recent months following signs of slowing hiring, which prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the first time in 2025. The absence of updated official data has raised concerns about the Fed’s ability to make fully informed monetary policy decisions.“Without up-to-date data, the Federal Reserve will not have the full picture it needs to make decisions this month about interest rates that will impact every family across the country,” warned Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.

US job cuts - grim picture





The US economy is staring at a prospect where its job losses for the year could cross 1 million! Nearly 95,00,00 layoffs have happened by US employers through September 2025, marking the highest such figures since 2020, according to outplacement specialists Challenger, Gray & Christmas quoted in a CBS report.The increase in workforce reductions coincides with a slowdown in the labour market, with organisations significantly reducing their recruitment plans, as employment data indicates. Firms are planning to recruit 58% fewer staff for the remainder of the year compared to their projections from the previous year.Challenger, Gray & Christmas predicts the job cuts might exceed 1 million in 2025. Whilst current job losses are significant, they remain considerably lower than the 2020 figures, when pandemic-related business closures resulted in 2 million layoffs through September that year, according to Challenger's analysis.""Previous periods with this many job cuts occurred either during recessions or, as was the case in 2005 and 2006, during the first wave of automations that cost jobs in manufacturing and technology,"" said Andy Challenger, senior vice president and labour expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas according to the CBS report.Additional job losses might result from the government shutdown, as the White House Office of Management and Budget has instructed federal agencies to consider staff reductions during any closure period.The upcoming October 3 government jobs report is expected to be delayed due to the federal shutdown, with economists projecting 50,000 new jobs added last month according to FactSet data.In light of the delayed government report, economists are turning to alternative labor market indicators to assess employment conditions.ADP's private sector employment report showed a decline of 32,000 jobs in September.There are indications that job cuts may be slowing down. Challenger's latest data revealed businesses announced approximately 54,000 job cuts in September, marking a significant 37% decrease from August's nearly 86,000 announced cuts.Economists are closely monitoring these various employment metrics to gauge the overall health of the labor market during the government shutdown period.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced a 0.25 percentage point reduction in the benchmark interest rate, citing concerns about worker challenges, with plans for two more rate cuts in 2025. The Fed is closely monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness.Lower borrowing costs could provide support to the job market, as businesses would have greater capacity to expand and hire when interest rates decrease.The labor market is currently facing multiple challenges, according to Challenger.""Right now, we're dealing with a stagnating labor market, cost increases and a transformative new technology. With rate cuts on the way, we may see some stabilizing in the job market in the fourth quarter, but other factors could keep employers planning layoffs or holding off hiring,"" Challenger said.The Federal Reserve's actions reflect its ongoing efforts to balance economic growth with labor market stability through monetary policy adjustments.","The US economy is staring at a prospect where its job losses for the year could cross 1 million.

Russian-Ukraine conflict: EU plans to use Moscow's frozen assets to fund Kyiv; here's how,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/russian-ukraine-conflict-eu-plans-to-use-moscows-frozen-assets-to-fund-kyiv-heres-how/articleshow/124289703.cms,"'Ukraine Surviving On Western Money': Hungary Slams Kyiv After Drone Intrusion Charge

Redirecting frozen funds





Size of the pot





Legal workaround





Who takes the risk









The European Union is working on a new financial plan to support Ukraine’s defence and rebuilding efforts by tapping into Russian central bank assets frozen in the West since Moscow’s invasion.Directly seizing these sovereign assets is banned under international law, so the European Commission has proposed a workaround that would allow EU governments to use the funds without technically confiscating them, Reuters reported.The plan involves using most of the 210 billion euros worth of Russian assets currently frozen in Europe, a sensitive issue for many EU capitals and the European Central Bank.The proposal has drawn broad political backing in principle, but several member states want more legal clarity before moving forward.Belgium, which hosts the Euroclear clearing house and has an annual national output of around 600 billion euros, has been particularly cautious about the financial and legal risks involved.When Russia launched its full-scale war in Ukraine, Euroclear held Russian central bank bonds. As these bonds matured, the proceeds were frozen under EU sanctions. The Commission’s plan would see these frozen cash balances channelled to the EU.In exchange, Euroclear would receive zero-coupon bonds from the Commission of the same value. The EU would then use the cash to issue what it calls a “Reparations Loan” to Ukraine.Kyiv would only repay this loan once it receives war reparations from Moscow in a future peace settlement, giving it access to the money immediately instead of waiting for compensation from Russia.Around $300 billion of Russian assets have been frozen worldwide. Of that, 210 billion euros ($229 billion) is held in Europe, with 185 billion euros managed by Euroclear in Brussels. Roughly 176 billion euros is already in cash, and another 9 billion euros in securities is set to mature in 2026.The EU would first use part of this to repay the 45 billion euros ($50 billion) G7 loan agreed with Ukraine last year, leaving about 140 billion euros to finance the new loan. The exact amount will depend on an International Monetary Fund assessment of Ukraine’s financial needs in 2026 and 2027. Finland and Sweden estimate that Kyiv will face a shortfall of around 130 billion euros during that period, Reuters reported.To avoid breaching international rules, the cash would be moved from Euroclear into a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) owned by EU or G7 governments. The Commission would then issue zero-coupon bonds to Euroclear, backed by the SPV. This structure is meant to protect Euroclear from legal challenges while allowing the EU to use the funds for investment rather than leaving them idle in overnight deposits at the European Central Bank.Russia has rejected the plan, describing it as an “illegal seizure” and warning of retaliatory measures.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said the risk would be shared among EU countries. The plan would need full guarantees from member states, with contributions proportionate to the size of their economies.Belgium has made it clear it does not want to shoulder the risk alone. Prime Minister Bart de Wever told EU leaders that Belgium’s hosting of Euroclear should not make it the only party accountable.“If we take (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's money, we use it, we're all going to be responsible if it goes wrong,” he said.He also insisted on strong legal assurances before Belgium signs off on the plan.",EU working on plan to tap into Russian central bank assets frozen in the West since Moscow’s invasion.

‘Pawn in trade negotiation’: China refuses to buy US soybeans; Donald Trump admin plans support for farmers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pawn-in-trade-negotiation-china-refuses-to-buy-us-soybeans-donald-trump-admin-plans-support-for-farmers/articleshow/124281710.cms,"



American farmers are looking at losing billions of dollars as Chinese importers have refused to buy US soybeans due to tensions between the two nations. To ease the blow, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent announced that the government will be rolling out new support measures for the farming sector.Bessent told CNBC that the federal government stands behind the farming community, which backed President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. “We’ve got their backs,” he said.“It’s unfortunate that Chinese leadership has decided to use the American farmers, soybean farmers in particular, as a hostage or pawn in the trade negotiations,” Bessent told Reuters.Trump on Wednesday said that soybeans would be a major topic of discussion when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping in four weeks.Bessent explained that buying American farm products is part of nearly every recent US trade deal. “So we’re going to see other countries substitute for China,” he said.However, despite efforts by the administration and the soybean industry, no other markets have come close to matching China’s usual purchase volumes. A record harvest has also added pressure on prices.Bessent said he met Trump and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins in the Oval Office on Wednesday.He asked farmers to expect “substantial support” to be announced on Tuesday, particularly for soybean growers.“On Tuesday, you’re going to see substantial support for the farmers, and we’re also going to be working with the Farm Credit Bureau to make sure that the farmers have what they need for next planting season,” he said.He added that an in-person meeting between Trump and Xi would help set the direction for future trade.“I think with President Trump's leadership and his relationship - the respect party chair Xi has for him - that this round, which would be our fifth round of talks, should show a pretty big breakthrough,” Bessent said.","Chinese importers have refused to buy US soybeans due to tensions between the two nations.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

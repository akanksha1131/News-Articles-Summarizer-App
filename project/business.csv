Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices remained range-bound last week, following a robust bullish rally in the preceding sessions. Global investors stayed on the sidelines, tracking developments on US–China and US–India trade negotiations. The US Federal Reserve, in its latest FOMC policy meeting, delivered a second consecutive rate cut, bringing the federal funds rate down to 3.75–4.00%, marking the lowest level in three years. However, Chair Jerome Powell’s neutral stance on the future monetary policy trajectory prompted profit-taking at higher levels on Thursday, leading to mild consolidation across key indices.Over the past six trading sessions, the Nifty has exhibited a sideways consolidation pattern, moving within a well-defined range of 25,700–26,100, broadly in line with expectations following the recent rally. This phase of time-wise correction suggests that the market is currently in a pause mode, digesting prior gains before the next directional move.From a technical perspective, sustained trade above the upper band of 26,100 could act as a trigger for bullish momentum, potentially propelling the index towards its previous all-time high of 26,277. A decisive breakout beyond this level may open the door for a further upside towards 26,500 in the near term, supported by improving market breadth and positive sectoral rotationThe broader market trajectory continues to exhibit a bullish bias, reaffirming that the primary uptrend remains firmly in place.The ongoing phase of consolidation is best interpreted as a healthy retracement and time correction following a sharp 1,500-point up move over the past four weeks.This constructive consolidation provides market participants with an opportune window to initiate fresh long positions and accumulate high-quality, fundamentally sound counters through a staggered accumulation strategy, thereby optimizing entry levels. In essence, the market appears to be undergoing a technical breather within an ongoing bullish structure, setting the stage for the next leg of the upward momentum once the consolidation base is firmly established.Strong support is seen around 25,700–25,500, which is likely to hold as it is the confluence of the recent breakout zone. The 20 days EMA is also placed around 25580 and the 38.2% retracement of the previous up move (24587-26104)Bank Nifty continues to maintain a bullish structure on the daily and weekly chart, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows in all time frames.Going ahead, a decisive move above last week’s high of 58,577 would confirm a breakout continuation, paving the way for a rally towards 59,000 and 59,300, which correspond to the 138.2% Fibonacci projection of the recent correction (57,628–53,561). However, failure to clear this level may result in range-bound movement between 58,600 and 57,300 in the near term.On the downside, immediate support is seen around 57,300–57,500, aligning with the previous breakout zone, while a stronger support base lies near 56,800–56,500.Overall, the outlook remains positive, and any pullbacks should be viewed as buying opportunities within these support areas.The stock has broken out above the falling trendline connecting the June 2025 and September 2025 highs, signaling strength and offering a fresh entry opportunity. The price action is forming a higher high–higher low structure on the daily timeframe, reinforcing the bullish outlook.We anticipate the stock to move higher towards the 129 level, which aligns with the June 2025 high and the 123.6% Fibonacci extension of the prior upswing from 98 to 117, projected from the recent low at 105.From a technical indicator perspective, the RSI remains in a bullish configuration and has recently triggered a buy signal, suggesting continued upward momentum.The stock is displaying a sustained bullish structure, forming consecutive higher highs and higher lows on the weekly chart. It has also broken out of a prolonged base formation, accompanied by a decisive breach of its falling trendline resistance — signaling a transition from a consolidation phase to a fresh uptrend.A clear breakout from the descending triangle pattern has already occurred thus opening upwards towards 62 in the medium term being measured move projection derived from the descending triangle breakout.On the indicator front, the weekly RSI is exhibiting a steady upward trajectory, reflecting sustained strength in momentum. There are no visible signs of exhaustion or bearish divergence, suggesting that the prevailing bullish momentum remains intact without indications of a trend reversal.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for October 31, 2025 are NBCC, and Sagility.

Eyewear retailer Lenskart Solutions has opened its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday, aiming to raise Rs 2,150 crore through a fresh issue of shares, while promoters and existing investors will sell 12.75 crore shares via an offer for sale (OFS).The IPO will remain open till November 4 and the company is set to hit Dalal Street on November 10. Shares will be alloted to investors on November 6.Lenskart plans to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards setting up new company-operated, company-owned (CoCo) stores, expenditure on lease and rental agreements for these outlets, and investments in technology, cloud infrastructure, and brand marketing. The company has also earmarked funds for potential inorganic acquisitions and general corporate purposes.It has a price band of Rs 382–Rs 402 per share, and is seeking a valuation of over Rs 69,700 crore on the upper end.The entity’s grey market premium stood at Rs 70 per share, according to ET. This indicates that the company’s shares might list around Rs 472, a premium of 17.41%.SBI Securities has advised investors to “Subscribe for long term”, pointing to Lenskart’s strong business model and its leadership in a market that has major space to grow.The brokerage said listing gains may be limited, but the company’s integrated supply chain, better profitability metrics, and strong brand strength support its long-term growth.Ventura Securities has also given a “Subscribe” recommendation, describing Lenskart as a growth-led business. It cited the company’s technology-focused strategy, AI-driven customer engagement, and a store payback period of under one year, adding that profitability is expected to strengthen as the business expands into additional regions.Nirmal Bang, according to ET, acknowledged that the IPO appears expensive at first, but the valuation holds up when compared with modern retail peers such as Trent and Metro. The brokerage maintained a Subscribe (long-term) stance, referring to Lenskart’s brand strength, premium product mix, and international expansion plans.The company’s market debut follows a strong response in the anchor book. On Thursday, Lenskart garnered bids worth around Rs 68,000 crore from anchor investors, people familiar with the matter told PTI. The bid amount was nearly 10 times the total issue size of Rs 7,278 crore and close to 20 times the Rs 3,268-crore anchor allocation. Ahead of the IPO, SBI Mutual Fund invested Rs 100 crore, while Avenue Supermarts (DMart) founder Radhakishan Damani invested around Rs 90 crore.Founded in 2008, Lenskart began as an online platform in 2010 and opened its first physical store in 2013 in New Delhi. It now operates an omni-channel model, offering prescription eyewear, sunglasses, and contact lenses across metro, tier-1, and tier-2 cities, and has expanded internationally to Southeast Asia and the Middle East.The company designs, manufactures, brands, and retails eyewear through facilities in Bhiwadi and Gurugram, supported by regional hubs in Singapore and the UAE. Lenskart added 847 stores since FY23, taking its network to 2,806 outlets as of June 2025, 2,137 in India and 669 overseas.According to ET, the company’s revenue surged over 32% annually to Rs 6,652.5 crore, while EBITDA rose 93.4% to Rs 971.1 crore, with margins improving to 14.6% in FY25 from 6.9% in FY23. Lenskart posted a net profit of Rs 297.3 crore in FY25, compared to a net loss of Rs 63.8 crore in FY23, though the profit was aided by one-off gains.Lenskart holds an estimated 4–6% market share in India’s eyewear market, but faces competition in a sector that remains 77% unorganised, according to Redseer, placing the company at a combination of a large opportunity and a highly fragmented market. According to Redseer, Lenskart was the largest seller of prescription eyeglasses in India by volume in FY25.","Lenskart Solutions has opened its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday.

Pak Minister Khawaja Asif Accuses Afghanistan Acting Under India’s Influence, Issues Brutal Warning

Importance of Chabahar port for India





In a boost for India’s regional connectivity plans especially with regard to Afghanistan, the Donald Trump administration has granted extension of sanctions waiver on Iran’s Chabahar port According to an ET report, India has managed to get an extension for the sanctions waiver until early next year on the Chabahar Port. This port plays a vital role in India’s regional connectivity strategy by providing access to Afghanistan and Central Asia-Eastern Russia.Following the expiry of the US sanctions waiver on Tuesday, India successfully negotiated an extension until early next year, sources told ET. During extensive discussions, India emphasised the necessity of maintaining the Chabahar Port's operations as an essential component of its regional connectivity initiatives.Earlier reports had confirmed that New Delhi was working towards obtaining an extension of the sanctions waiver, with the matter under review. India had received a US sanctions waiver for the port until October 28, following an initial deadline of September 29 for the waiver's revocation.On May 13, 2024, India entered into a decade-long agreement to operate the Chabahar port. The contract was finalised between Indian Ports Global Limited and Iran's Port & Maritime Organisation.The Chabahar Port plays a vital role in strengthening India-Afghanistan economic relations and delivering humanitarian assistance, including ambulances that India provided during the Afghan foreign minister's recent visit.The Taliban administration shows strong interest in utilising the Chabahar Port for international connections.Plans are underway to link Chabahar Port with the International North-South Transport Corridor and Central Asian nations. Sources told the financial daily that India's Central Asian ally Uzbekistan, following a multipolar approach, seeks alternatives to China's Belt and Road Initiative for connectivity in Eurasia and anticipates India's involvement in addressing Chabahar Port matters.Notably, Uzbekistan holds the distinction of being one of only two doubly landlocked countries globally, alongside Liechtenstein.Reports suggest that Russia intends to access the Chabahar Port through Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to facilitate trade with India and other Asian regions.","On May 13, 2024, India entered into a decade-long agreement to operate the Chabahar port.

8th Pay Commission: Top things to know about Cabinet decision





In a big cheer for central government employees, PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet on Tuesday approved the Terms of Reference for the 8th Central Pay Commission.The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will raise the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and pensions of 69 lakh retired personnel.In January 2025, the Government announced the formation of the 8th Central Pay Commission to review and propose revisions to the salaries and benefits of Central Government employees.Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: How much salary & pension hike should central government employees, pensioners expect? Top things to know According to the Cabinet release, the 8th Central Pay Commission Commission will function as a temporary entity, consisting of a Chairperson, one Part-Time Member, and one Member-Secretary. Its recommendations are due within 18 months of its establishment, with the possibility of submitting interim reports when specific recommendations are finalised.The 8th Pay Commission, led by former Supreme Court justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, will deliver a preliminary report to the government.Professor Pulak Ghosh from IIM Bangalore has been appointed as a part-time commissioner, whilst Petroleum Secretary Pankaj Jain will serve as the Member Secretary.When questioned about the implementation timing of the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations, I&B Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""The specific date will be decided once the interim report comes in... But, mostly it should be January 1, 2026.""The 8th Central Pay Commission's deliberations will consider:i. The economic conditions in the country and the need for fiscal prudence;ii. The need to ensure that adequate resources are available for developmental expenditure and welfare measures;iii. The unfunded cost of non-contributory pension schemes;iv. The likely impact of the recommendations on the finances of the State Governments which usually adopt the recommendations with some modifications; andv. The prevailing emolument structure, benefits and working conditions available to employees of Central Public Sector Undertakings and private sector.Terms of Reference (TOR) serves as a framework document for a pay commission, establishing guidelines and parameters for preparing its report. It includes essential definitions, terms and conditions that guide the commission's work.The Terms of Reference is drafted by a Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM), with final approval from the Cabinet Committee under the Finance Ministry. The JCM includes union representatives from various ministries. From its 60 members, 12 are chosen for the standing committee. These selected members engage in discussions about TOR subjects with secretary-level government officials. The finalised TOR is then submitted for Cabinet approval.The significance of TOR lies in its function as a main reference document when a pay commission develops its recommendations.According to a TOI report, the government has kept the terms of reference undisclosed, yet the committee's primary responsibility involves examining the financial implications of non-contributory pension programmes.The central government's decision to transition from the National Pension System to Unified Pension Scheme for pre-2004 recruits lacks clarity on pension payment obligations.This absence of estimated liabilities has resulted in no budgetary allocations. Additionally, any increase in employee remuneration and benefits will inevitably lead to enhanced pension commitments.Central Pay Commissions are established periodically to evaluate and recommend changes to emoluments, retirement benefits and service conditions for Central Government employees.These recommendations are typically implemented on a ten-year cycle. Following this pattern, the 8th Central Pay Commission's recommendations would take effect from January 1, 2026.The 7th Pay Commission was established in February 2014, with its proposals taking effect from January 1, 2016.Central government staff receive dearness allowance (DA) to offset inflation's impact on their actual salary value. This DA rate undergoes regular revision every six months, with adjustments linked to inflation levels.","The 8th Central Pay Commission’s proposals will raise the salaries of approximately 50 lakh central government staff members and pensions of 69 lakh retired personnel.

NTPC Ltd has begun drilling India’s first-ever geological carbon dioxide (CO2) storage well at its Pakri Barwadih coal mine in Jharkhand, marking a significant milestone in the country’s carbon capture and storage efforts.The initiative, spearheaded by NTPC’s R&D arm-- the NTPC Energy Technology Research Alliance (NETRA)-- represents a crucial step in advancing India’s Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) roadmap and its commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, the company said in a statement, PTI reported.“NTPC has marked an important milestone in the nation's clean energy transition by commencing drilling for the country's first-ever CO2 injection borewell at its Pakri Barwadih Coal Mine, Jharkhand,” the company said.The borewell, designed to reach a depth of around 1,200 metres, aims to gather vital geological and reservoir data to enable safe and efficient long-term CO2 storage. The process involves extensive core, methane, and water sampling, along with seismic monitoring and simulation studies to evaluate the rock formations’ capacity for permanent carbon sequestration.Describing the project as the first of its kind in India, NTPC said it forms an essential part of its broader CCUS programme, which seeks to develop indigenous carbon storage technologies for large-scale application across the power and industrial sectors.NTPC, India’s largest integrated power utility, currently contributes about one-fourth of the nation’s electricity needs. The company has an installed capacity of over 84 GW, with an additional 30.90 GW under construction — including 13.3 GW of renewable energy projects.Reaffirming its sustainability goals, NTPC said it aims to achieve 60 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2032, further reinforcing India’s progress toward its long-term net-zero objectives.","NTPC Ltd has begun drilling India’s first-ever geological carbon dioxide (CO2) storage well at its Pakri Barwadih coal mine in Jharkhand.

Gold market outlook: Prices fall for 2nd week as dollar gains and Fed caution hit demand; silver edges up after sharp swings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-market-outlook-prices-fall-for-2nd-week-as-dollar-gains-and-fed-caution-hit-demand-silver-edges-up-after-sharp-swings/articleshow/125020286.cms,"Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices





Gold prices continued to slide for the second straight week, pressured by a stronger dollar, easing geopolitical tensions, and the US Federal Reserve’s cautious signals on rate cuts that dented demand for safe-haven assets.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures for December delivery fell Rs 2,219, or 1.8 per cent, over the week. The yellow metal hit an intra-day low of Rs 1,17,628 per 10 grams on October 28, marking a sharp reversal after nine weeks of gains, PTI reported.Analysts said global and domestic gold markets witnessed a steep correction earlier in the week as investors booked profits following recent highs.“Heavy profit-booking pushed global gold down from recent highs to test the $4,000-an-ounce level. Domestic gold mirrored this, falling below Rs 1,19,000 per 10 grams before stabilising and recovering modestly in the latter half of the week,” said Sneha Jain, Investment Manager on Smallcase and Founder and CEO of WealthTrust Capital Services.She added that MCX gold futures showed high volatility, dropping from above Rs 1,23,000 to nearly Rs 1,18,000 per 10 grams before rebounding to around Rs 1,21,500.The dollar’s strength also weighed on bullion. “The US dollar index surged after the Fed’s comments, making dollar-priced gold more expensive for foreign buyers and triggering selling.Rising bond yields earlier in the week also made non-yielding bullion less attractive,” Jain said.In international trade, Comex gold futures for December delivery fell $141.3, or 3.41 per cent, during the week to settle at $3,996.5 per ounce on Friday. The drop came after gold briefly touched fresh highs in early October before profit-taking set in.The rupee traded with a mild weakening bias against the US dollar, which slightly cushioned the fall in domestic gold prices.Sandip Raichura, CEO of Retail Broking & Distribution and Director at PL Capital, said the week’s developments were largely negative for gold. “Tensions between Russia and Ukraine eased, Trump-Xi talks were positive, the Fed remained hawkish on rates, and India’s festival buying season ended. All these factors were gold-negative in the short term,” he said.Silver prices showed resilience after two weeks of turbulence. On the MCX, silver futures for December delivery rose Rs 817, or 0.55 per cent, ending their losing streak.“Silver futures experienced a larger crash, falling from near Rs 1,55,000 per kg to test Rs 1,45,000 before regaining some ground,” said Jain of WealthTrust Capital Services.On Comex, silver futures remained largely flat, closing the week at $48.16 per ounce.N S Ramaswamy, Head of Commodities & CRM at Ventura, said remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell cooled the metals rally by signalling that future rate cuts would depend on macroeconomic data.“After hitting new peaks, a natural correction phase and profit taking has occurred. But long-term structural drivers — including shifts in monetary policy, spiralling US debt, central bank buying, persistent inflation, and geopolitical risks — remain bullish,” Ramaswamy said.Analysts believe sustained central bank accumulation could push gold toward record highs in the coming months. “Western sanctions have reinforced central banks’ desire to diversify away from the dollar. Ballooning federal debt, fiscal deficits, and the ongoing government shutdown have further strengthened gold’s safe-haven appeal,” Ramaswamy added.","On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold futures for December delivery fell Rs 2,219, or 1.8 per cent, over the week. The yellow metal hit an intra-day low of Rs 1,17,628 per 10 grams on October 28, marking a sharp reversal after nine weeks of gains.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125020323,imgsize-822371,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
October GST collection up 4.6% to Rs 2 Lakh-crore despite tax cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/october-gst-collection-up-4-6-to-rs-2-lakh-crore-despite-tax-cuts/articleshow/125027509.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The impact of pre-GST revamp pause in sale of several products, such as automobiles and white goods, and the lower rates rolled out from Sept 22 slowed down the growth in gross GST receipts but the mop up remained close to the Rs 2 lakh crore-level, data for October showed. Official numbers released on Saturday showed GST collections in Oct for transactions in Sept totalled 1.96 lakh crore, an increase of 4.6% compared to Rs 1.87 lakh crore in October last year.This was the slowest pace of increase this fiscal. In Aug and Sept, GST collection rose 6.5% to Rs 1.86 lakh crore and at 9.1% to Rs 1.89 lakh crore. Gross domestic revenue grew 2% to Rs 1.45 lakh crore, while tax from imports rose nearly 13% to Rs 50,884 crore in October. The data showed GST refunds rose 39.6% year-on-year in Oct to Rs 26,934 crore.In Sept, GST Council had unveiled reforms to GST rate structure, which led to a sharp reduction in rates on a raft of items, bringing relief to consumers, and the latest data showed apprehensions of decline in collections have been negated.The rate cuts, effective September 22, have revived consumption demand, and experts said GST revenues for Nov are likely to show a sharp rebound.""Despite massive rate cuts effective from September 22, a slight increase in domestic GST collection is very encouraging and shows that demand is steadily increasing,"" said Pratik Jain, Partner at consulting firm Price Waterhouse & Co LLP.""Consistent increase in GST refunds (domestic as well as exports) shows confidence of tax administration that GST collections would show positive trend in future as well. Next month's data would have the full impact of GST cuts and would be keenly awaited,"" added Jain.On the back of a fillip provided by a reduction in GST on 375 items, consumers had flocked to stores and car dealerships resulting in highest Navratri sales in over a decade, government officials had earlier said, citing industry data.""The GST collections, while aligning with immediate expectations, reflect a muted momentum in Sept primarily due to rate rationalisation effect in the majority part of the Sept month and the deferred consumer spending ahead of the upcoming festive season. This anticipated lag is likely to be compensated by more robust numbers in the next month, driven by seasonal buoyancy,"" said Saurabh Agarwal, Tax Partner at EY India. ""The impressive, high percentage growth in collections from states and UTs like Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Lakshadweep and Ladakh is a tangible indicator of holistic economic development across India,"" he said.","GST collections in Oct for transactions in Sept totalled 1.96 lakh crore, an increase of 4.6%.

SBI expands bullion footprint: Bank joins India International Bullion Exchange as special category client; aims to boost transparency & efficiency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-expands-bullion-footprint-bank-joins-india-international-bullion-exchange-as-special-category-client-aims-to-boost-transparency-efficiency/articleshow/125020037.cms,"



State Bank of India (SBI) on Saturday said it has executed its first gold trade as a special category client (SCC) on the India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX), marking a key step in reshaping India’s bullion import framework.The move, SBI said, signals “a transformative era” for the bullion trade by enhancing efficiency, transparency, and accessibility, especially for MSME jewellers, PTI reported.SBI, which became the first bank to join IIBX as a Trading-cum-Clearing (TCM) Member in 2024, said its new SCC status positions it to facilitate seamless bullion transactions for jewellers, bullion dealers, and other stakeholders.In a statement, the bank said its participation would help streamline gold imports through IIBX and reduce dependence on traditional channels, meeting the country’s rising demand for precious metals.SBI Chairman C S Setty said the partnership with IIBX reinforces the bank’s leadership role in financial services and aligns with the government’s goal of modernising the bullion ecosystem.“This collaboration not only reinforces the bank's role as a pioneer in financial services but also contributes to reshaping bullion imports, making them more cost-effective and compliant with global standards,” Setty said.“It’s a moment of national pride, benefiting the entire ecosystem — from importers to consumers in the jewellery sector,” he added.SBI said its participation underscores a strategic focus on GIFT City as a global financial hub and supports government efforts to formalise and modernise the bullion trade.By acting as a key intermediary on IIBX, the bank aims to boost liquidity, competitive pricing, and sustainable growth across India’s bullion and jewellery sector. The initiative could also encourage other nominated banks to join IIBX as special category clients, collectively strengthening the country’s position in the global gold market, SBI said.","State Bank of India said it has executed its first gold trade as a special category client (SCC) on the India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX) SBI said its new SCC status positions it to facilitate seamless bullion transactions for jewellers, bullion dealers, and other stakeholders.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125020059,imgsize-570991,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

India’s Digital ID, GST Reform Win Global Recognition From IMF Chief Kristalina Georgieva





NEW DELHI: The GST cut and festive fervour fuelled car and SUV sales to a record as retails in October hit an all-time high for the industry with heavy footfalls across brands and price points, especially at the entry-level.While final numbers are still being calculated, estimates put passenger vehicle retails in the month between 5.5 lakh and 5.7 lakh units, powered by strong sales from brands such as Maruti Suzuki , Tata Motors, Hyundai, and Toyota, apart from luxury makers such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.Maruti saw a 20% growth in retails as it sold 2.4 lakh units at a growth of 20%. Partho Banerjee, Senior Executive Officer (Marketing & Sales) at Maruti, said numbers were led by the grouping of entry-level cars such as Alto, S Presso, WagonR and Celerio that saw a surge following significant price cuts.“We could’ve delivered more if we had more in the stocks,” Banerjee said, adding that demand is expected to stay strong in November and December. “The govt’s GST reforms aimed at upgrading entry-level buyers to 4-Wheelers are in the works here. The share of mini entry cars to our sales, which was 17% in the Apr-Sep FY26 period, has now grown to 20%. We are getting upgrades from two-wheelers, even as demand for our SUVs and premium cars remains strong.Tata Motors’ reported retail sales of around 75,000 units (67,981), recording a 15% growth. “We have achieved a milestone as GST cuts and festivities boosted demand. … We believe this performance sets the tone for the rest of the fiscal as we gear up for exciting launches this year, including the new Sierra,” said Shailesh Chandra, MD & CEO of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles.Tarun Garg, COO of Hyundai India, said high demand is a significant booster for the industry. “… we witnessed robust market demand and high consumer enthusiasm (and) expect to accelerate this momentum.”Gaurav Vangaal of S&P Global Mobility said October’s retail was the highest-ever and was helped by pent-up demand as buyers had delayed purchases before GST cuts. “Companies overcame car carrier shortages to keep dispatches flowing. Looking ahead, the industry remains watchful: global electronic parts supply disruptions still loom large.”In luxury, Mercedes recorded strong retails too. Santosh Iyer, MD & CEO of Mercedes-Benz, said bookings and retails had been strong throughout October. “Going by the trends, this should be the best ever October for us.”Ashish Gupta, Brand Director at Skoda Auto India said the GST reform helped set the stage for a strong and positive festive season. “Our product offensive, combined with rapid network expansion, resulted in our highest-ever monthly sales in our 25-year journey in India.”The record numbers were not just confined to the domestic market, but even extended to exports. Maruti saw record numbers. “Maruti exported 31,304 units in October 2025… we are on track to exceed our annual export target of 400,000 units,” Rahul Bharti, Senior Executive Officer at Maruti said.",GST cut and festive fervour fuelled car and SUV sales to a record as retails in October hit an all-time high.

Indian telecom player Bankim Brahmbhatt bunks US after $ 500 million rip-off,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-telecom-player-bankim-brahmbhatt-bunks-us-after-500-rip-off/articleshow/125017555.cms,"Bankim Brahmbhatt

The TOI correspondent from Washington:





With two BMWs, a Porsche, a Tesla, and an Audi gathering dust in the driveway and unopened mail at the door of his New York Mcmansion, Bankim Brahmbhatt is said to be on the lam, having allegedly scammed the private credit arm of Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager, and others, of $ 500 million.In a financial scandal that has rocked the US private credit market, the Indian-origin entrepreneur and founder-CEO of US-based telecom firms Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice (under the Bankai Group), is accused of orchestrating a massive fraud using phony accounts and fabricated emails to secure asset-based financing from heavyweights like Blackrock subsidiary HPS Investment Partners and BNP Paribas.The deception, first reported in the Wall Street Journal, unraveled in July when an HPS employee spotted suspicious customer emails originating from fake domains mimicking real telecom giants like T-Mobile and Telstra. The rip-off spanned more than five years. Investigations by accounting and law firms, including Deloitte and CBiz, confirmed widespread falsification: all submitted invoices and email addresses were bogus.Lenders claim Brahmbhatt built ""an elaborate balance sheet of assets that existed only on paper,"" with the Belgian telecom firm BICS, cited in the collateral, denying any ties, and labeling it a ""confirmed fraud attempt.""HPS began lending to Brahmbhatt's financing arm in September 2020, ramping up to $430 million by August 2024, with BNP Paribas covering roughly half the total exposure. Confronted in July, Brahmbhatt reportedly dismissed concerns before going incommunicado.Also read: Who is Bankim Brahmbhatt? Indian-origin CEO accused of $500m ‘breathtaking’ fraud at BlackRock – Key details Months later, Broadband Telecom, Bridgevoice, related entities Carriox Capital II and BB Capital SPV, and Brahmbhatt himself filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 12 this year in the US Bankruptcy Court of Eastern District of New York. Court documents confirm over $500M owed, primarily to HPS and BNP Paribas.Subsequently, HPS representatives found Brahmbhatt's Garden City, Long Island, office locked and deserted. An employee at an adjacent office told WSJ she hadn’t seen anyone enter or leave the offices recently. Authorities believe Brahmbhatt may have fled to India. The lenders also believe he may have transferred assets to accounts in India and Mauritius.Very little is known about Brahmbhatt. He is reported to have attended St Xavier's School in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, and began his business career in 1989 with a push-button telephone manufacturing unit in India, later expanding to satellite dishes and media receivers. He was featured in Capacity's 2023 Power 100 List for his work in the telecom industry.Although any write off would be chump change for Blackrock, which manages $ 13.5 trillion in assets, the scandal exposes vulnerabilities in private credit's $1.7 trillion boom which now involve faster deals, less oversight, and heavy borrower-data reliance. Experts warn of a ""cockroach effect,"" a term coined by economist Mohamed El-Erian, signaling more hidden frauds due to lax, unregulated lending.In recent weeks, Wall Street has been shaken by two other such scandals: First Brands, an auto-parts supplier founded by Malaysian-Indian businessman Patrick James, also filed for bankruptcy earlier this year after the market lost confidence in its use of off-balance-sheet debt. Separately, Tricolor, a chain of auto dealers that financed subprime consumers, is accused by a bank partner of pledging fictitious car loans and has filed for bankruptcy.For HPS, BNP, and investors, recouping even part of the half-billion will now involve a global chase, including lawsuits in India and Mauritius and litigation to freeze offshore funds.",Bankim Brahmbhatt is the founder-CEO of US-based telecom firms Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice.

Coal revival drive: ECL reopens two closed mines under MDO model; aims to cut losses and lift output,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/coal-revival-drive-ecl-reopens-two-closed-mines-under-mdo-model-aims-to-cut-losses-and-lift-output/articleshow/125017146.cms,"



In a major step towards restructuring its operations, Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) has reopened two previously closed mines under the Mine Developer and Operator (MDO) revenue-sharing model.The move, inaugurated virtually by Union Coal Minister G Kishan Reddy on Saturday, marks a strategic shift aimed at reviving loss-making assets and improving operational efficiency, PTI reported .The two projects — Gopinathpur open cast in Jharkhand’s Dhanbad district and Chinakuri underground in West Bengal’s Paschim Bardhaman district — are the first ECL mines to resume production under the revenue-sharing framework. The initiative is expected to strengthen coal output, attract private participation, and support the company’s cost-optimisation efforts.ECL Chairman and Managing Director Satish Jha said the reopening of these mines forms part of a broader restructuring strategy under which 16 loss-making mines have been amalgamated into 10 and offered to private operators through the MDO route.The Gopinathpur open cast project has an extractable reserve of 13.73 million tonnes with a peak rated capacity (PRC) of 0.76 million tonnes per year.The MDO operator will share 4.59 per cent of revenue with ECL over the 25-year contract, which began coal production on September 13, 2025.The Chinakuri underground project -- ECL’s first underground mine to operate under the MDO model -- holds an extractable reserve of 16.70 million tonnes and targets a PRC of 1 million tonnes annually. The operator will share 8 per cent of its revenue with ECL under a similar 25-year agreement, officials said.ECL described the operationalisation of the two projects as a “major milestone” in its turnaround efforts, saying the model ensures a sustainable framework for cost reduction and production enhancement while leveraging private expertise in coal mining.The company expects the MDO-based approach to improve productivity, reduce operational inefficiencies, and strengthen its overall financial performance in the coming years.","Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) has reopened two previously closed mines under the Mine Developer and Operator (MDO) revenue-sharing model.

Dearness relief , family pension and EPS also see automatic gains

Old pension: Rs 20,000 → DR @ 20% = Rs 4,000

Revised pension: Rs 30,000 → DR @ 20% = Rs 6,000

For instance:

Old basic pay Rs 40,000 → EPS Rs 20,000

With a fitment factor of 3.0 → revised pay Rs 1,20,000 → EPS Rs 60,000

Higher pension also means higher tax liability

Before revision:

Pension (basic): Rs 20,000 per month = Rs 2,40,000 per year

DR: Rs 6,000 per month = Rs 72,000 per year

Total taxable pension income: Rs 3,12,000

Tax payable: Rs 600

After revision (with higher fitment factor):

Pension (basic): Rs 50,000 per month = Rs 6,00,000 per year

DR: Rs 15,000 per month = Rs 1,80,000 per year

Total taxable pension income: Rs 7,80,000

Total tax payable: Rs 66,000

The fitment factor under the 8th Pay Commission will be decided once the Union Cabinet considers and clears the commission’s recommendations.





Many retired central government employees are waiting to see how the 8th Pay Commission will impact their pensions, now that the Centre has approved the commission’s Terms of Reference (ToR) and given an 18-month timeline for the report.Although pay commission discussions usually revolve around serving employees, pensioners outnumber them.As per the government’s Pensioners’ Portal, there were 68.72 lakh pensioners as of October 30 across civil, defence, telecommunications, railways and postal departments. By comparison, the number of central government employees stands at about 50 lakh.The size of the pension increase will majorly depend on the fitment factor, the multiplier used to revise salaries and pensions under each pay commission. In the 7th Pay Commission, this factor was fixed at 2.57, resulting in basic pay being raised to 2.57 times the earlier amount under the 6th Pay Commission.The fitment factor for the 8th Pay Commission will only be confirmed after the Union Cabinet approves the commission’s recommendations.Manjeet Singh Patel, National President of the All India NPS Employees Federation, said that while everyone talks about the fitment factor, pensioners want other long-pending issues corrected as well.""A high fitment factor means a higher pension hike. But there are two key areas we want the government to fulfil. One is on commutation of salary. As per the current rules, if pensioners opt for a 40% pension commutation, they get reduced pension for 15 years. We want the government to reduce it to 12 years,” he told ET.He adds that medical support under CGHS remains inadequate in many places.""Plus, there are a lot of areas where CGHS hospitals are not available and pensioners get a fixed Rs 3,000/month for their medical benefits. We feel for an aged person, it's a meagre amount and it should be increased to Rs 20,000. More hospitals at the district level should also be brought under the CGHS service,"" Patel says.The fitment factor is a multiplier used when pay scales are revised. Under the 7th Pay Commission, it was 2.57, meaning basic pay increased 2.57 times.Ramachandran Krishnamoorthy, Director – Payroll Services, Nexdigm, explains that the same logic applies to pensions. For example, if the basic pay was Rs 10,000 earlier, in the 7th CPC matrix it became Rs 25,700 after applying the factor. A higher multiplier under the 8th CPC automatically pushes up pensions, according to ET.Illustration of basic pension changes:In another example, if the existing basic pension is Rs 25,000 and the fitment factor becomes 2.0, the new basic pension becomes Rs 50,000: Rs 25,000 × 2 = Rs 50,000Whenever the basic pension rises, Dearness Relief also increases because it is calculated as a percentage of the revised pension.EPS, family pension and enhanced pension are similarly affected.Family pension (typically 30% of pension for central government pensioners) also increases in line with the new basic.Pension is treated as income from salary under the Income Tax Act. Once the 8th CPC increases the pension amount, the taxable income rises too.","The size of the pension increase will majorly depend on the fitment factor, the multiplier used to revise salaries and pensions under each pay commission.

NEW DELHI: Cyclone Montha, brewing over the Arabian Sea, is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm and make landfall along the Andhra Pradesh coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam, near Kakinada, by Tuesday evening, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The name Montha meaning “beautiful” or “fragrant flower” was suggested by Thailand, one of the 13 member countries of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and UN ESCAP panel that governs cyclone naming in the North Indian Ocean region. Each name is used only once and never repeated.In the North Indian Ocean, which includes the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, cyclone naming is managed by the WMO/ESCAP Panel on Tropical Cyclones. This panel includes 13 countries: India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Oman, Yemen, Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.Each member submits a list of names that reflect their culture, language, or natural environment. The names are then used sequentially whenever a new cyclone reaches the intensity required to be officially named by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which acts as the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for this region.Each country has submitted 13 names, forming a list of 169 names used sequentially and alphabetically. Names are neutral to gender, politics, and religion. The first cyclone of this season, Shakhti, suggested by Sri Lanka, formed earlier this month in the Arabian Sea but spared the Indian coast.The cyclone is likely to bring heavy rain across Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Tamil Nadu with red alerts issued for several coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh.After Montha, the next cyclones will be named Senyar (UAE), Ditwah (Yemen), Arnab (Bangladesh), and Murasu (India). The naming system began in 2004, following a decision by the WMO and ESCAP in 2000, to make communication about tropical storms simpler and more effective for public awareness and disaster management.","Cyclone Montha, brewing over the Arabian Sea, is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm by October 28.

Explained: How an Indian-origin entrepreneur 'borrowed' $500 million from the world's biggest asset manager,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/explained-how-an-indian-origin-entrepreneur-borrowed-500-million-from-the-worlds-biggest-asset-manager/articleshow/125019184.cms,"customers didn’t exist.

The Discovery: A Suspicious Email and a Locked Office



The Method: How the Fraud Worked



Here’s how Brahmbhatt did it:

Fake customers: He invented telecom clients that didn’t exist.

Fake invoices : He created bills showing those clients owed millions.

: He created bills showing those clients owed millions. Fake confirmations: He built lookalike domains and sent “proof” emails to lenders.

Real money: He used the fake receivables to get real loans from HPS and BNP Paribas.

Offshore transfers: Some pledged assets were quietly moved to accounts in India and Mauritius.

The Fallout: BlackRock’s $500 Million Lesson



The Bigger Picture: When Easy Money Meets Easy Lies



The Vanishing Act



In Simple Terms



What happened? A telecom CEO faked invoices and customers to borrow $500 million.

Who got fooled? BlackRock’s lending arm HPS Investment Partners and co-lender BNP Paribas.

How was it caught? An analyst noticed suspicious customer emails.

What’s the damage? Bankrupt companies, hundreds of millions in losses, and lawsuits.





Imagine running a small telecom company and convincing the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, that your business is booming. That’s what Indian-origin entrepreneur Bankim Brahmbhatt allegedly managed to do.Through his companies — Broadband Telecom, Bridgevoice, and Carriox Capital — Brahmbhatt borrowed more than $500 million from private-credit lenders led by HPS Investment Partners, a firm recently acquired by BlackRock. The collateral he offered sounded solid: accounts receivable, or money his companies were supposedly owed by customers.The problem? ThoseAccording to court filings, nearly every invoice, email, and contract he provided was fake. He had built an empire on paper — complete with forged emails and invoices from imaginary telecom clients.The scheme unravelled by accident.In July, an HPS employee noticed that some customer emails confirming Brahmbhatt’s invoices looked strange. They came from addresses like @bics-telecom.com instead of the real @bics.com. When auditors investigated, they found that every customer email used to verify invoices over the past two years was fake.Some of the supposed clients had never even heard of him.When lenders raised the issue, Brahmbhatt assured them there was “nothing to worry about” — then stopped answering calls.An investigator sent to his New York office found it locked and deserted. His nearby home was another scene out of a movie: two BMWs, a Porsche, a Tesla and an Audi parked neatly outside, and packages left unopened on the porch.This wasn’t a classic Ponzi scheme or crypto scam. It was something quieter, hidden inside the machinery of modern finance. Brahmbhatt tapped into a system called asset-based lending, where loans are given against business income or customer payments. In theory, it’s low-risk. In practice, it’s easy to game.It was a symphony of forgery, spreadsheets, and confidence — the kind of scam that works best when no one expects it.When the truth came out, Brahmbhatt’s companies filed for bankruptcy in August. BNP Paribas, which helped fund the loans, added around $220 million to its loan-loss provisions. HPS told its investors that while the hit was painful, it wouldn’t threaten its $179 billion portfolio.Still, the embarrassment was enormous. The world’s most sophisticated asset manager had been duped by forged PDFs and fake emails.Private credit — lending by funds instead of banks — has exploded in recent years. It’s fast, profitable, and lightly regulated. But the Brahmbhatt case shows just how fragile it can be.Two other collapses this year, in the US auto industry, had already raised alarms. Companies like First Brands and Tricolor were accused of doing the same thing: inflating assets and pledging fiction as collateral. Brahmbhatt simply took that playbook global.This wasn’t a story about high finance. It was a story about trust — and how quickly it can be sold.As of now, Bankim Brahmbhatt’s whereabouts remain unclear. His lawyer says he denies any wrongdoing. HPS believes he’s in India. His personal bankruptcy, filed the same day as his companies’, adds a strange symmetry to the scandal — the man and his empire collapsing together.Where is he now? Missing.It wasn’t a hacker or a rogue algorithm that fooled Wall Street this time. It was a man with a spreadsheet, a smile, and a very good understanding of how belief works. The real trick wasn’t inventing fake customers. It was convincing everyone that no one needed to check.","Indian-origin entrepreneur Bankim Brahmbhatt allegedly managed to borrow more than $500 million from private-credit lenders.

Chip export thaw: China exempts some Nexperia products from ban; signals easing with Europe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chip-export-thaw-china-exempts-some-nexperia-products-from-ban-signals-easing-with-europe/articleshow/125018083.cms,"



China on Saturday said it will exempt certain Nexperia semiconductor products from an export ban imposed amid a dispute with Dutch authorities, signalling a partial easing of tensions that had alarmed European businesses.Anxiety over potential chip shortages had mounted after the Netherlands invoked a Cold War-era law in late September to take control of Nexperia, whose parent company Wingtech is backed by the Chinese government, AFP reported. Beijing responded by banning any re-exports of Nexperia chips to Europe and accused the United States of interfering in Dutch legal procedures to oust the Chinese CEO of the firm.China’s commerce ministry said in a statement that it would “comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria,” though it did not specify which chips would be covered.The Wall Street Journal reported that the partial resumption of Nexperia shipments formed part of a trade deal agreed between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump after talks in South Korea on Thursday.The announcement came as Chinese and European Union officials held talks in Brussels on Friday to discuss export controls and supply chain issues. EU spokesman Olof Gill said the discussions provided “a welcome opportunity for both sides to update on the introduction and implementation of export controls,” including China’s restrictions on rare earth elements.Berlin welcomed Beijing’s move as a “positive sign”. “The latest reports from China are positive initial signs of an easing of tensions,” a spokesman for Germany’s economy ministry told AFP, while adding that “a final assessment” of the decision’s implications was still pending.Nexperia produces components such as diodes, transistors, and voltage regulators that are widely used in the automotive and electronics industries. The company manufactures most of its products in Europe, sends them to China for finishing, and re-exports them to European clients.European carmakers and parts suppliers had warned that prolonged restrictions on Nexperia components could disrupt production lines. According to German financial daily Handelsblatt, Nexperia supplies 49 per cent of the electronic components used in the European automotive industry.While French parts maker OPmobility said the chips were “easily substitutable”, it added that obtaining approvals for alternative components from automakers would take time.Beijing suggested that companies facing difficulties could contact the commerce ministry or local authorities for assistance as some shipments resume under the exemption framework.",China exempts certain Nexperia semiconductor products from export ban imposed amid dispute with Dutch authorities.

Will this ease the pressure on their economies?

Too late for the soybean agreement

US labour market continues to weaken

China has deeper woes

No signed deal yet





During their latest meeting in South Korea, US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping managed to cool the intense trade stand-off between their countries briefly.The two leaders reached a provisional deal: the US would trim tariffs on Chinese goods by 10%, bringing the rate down to 47%, while China would pause its export curbs on rare earth minerals and increase purchases of American soybeans.Trump hailed the talks as “a great success,” adding that he will visit China in April next year, with Xi expected to travel to the US soon after.However, even after the temporary truce, the bigger question still looms.Though China no longer faces a threat of Trump's 100% tariffs and US gets to sell its soybeans, there is a bigger picture.Among the hardest hit by the tariff tussle are American soybean farmers. The commodity, the country’s largest agricultural export, has been effectively shut out of China since May, when higher tariffs triggered an embargo.Until this week, China had not placed a single new order.The timing of this breakthrough may be too late for many growers.Peak harvest season is already under way, and months of muted demand already forced farmers to sell their crops at lower prices, CNN reported.Though Trump has promised that China will purchase “tremendous amounts” of soybeans, but the financial damage has already been done for producers who needed revenue weeks ago.The US job market, which had begun losing momentum before Trump returned to office, has slowed even further. Hiring has tapered off as companies hold back expansion plans due to tariff uncertainty, and layoffs are becoming more common. For the first time in several years, there are now more unemployed workers than job openings, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Technology shifts are adding pressure. Artificial intelligence is contributing to job cuts across multiple sectors, including a wave of redundancies at Amazon this week. Policymakers warn that monetary tools are unlikely to solve the problem, CNN reported.Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller stressed that “if AI constitutes a structural shift in the demand for labor, monetary policy will not be an effective tool.”Rate cuts could also push inflation higher, at a moment when the cost of goods and services is already rising, affected both by tariffs and tighter immigration rules that have reduced labour supply in farming and childcare.Despite resilient export performance during Trump’s global tariff offensive, China’s longstanding domestic problems show no sign of improvement. The country continues to grapple with a protracted property downturn, deflation pressures, weak consumer sentiment and high youth unemployment.Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, told CNN that the revised trade terms offer limited upside, saying that “beyond a cyclical impulse, it’s hard to see today’s revised trade terms as materially shifting China’s more structural challenges at home, where we think tariffs are, if anything, fading in macro relevance.”The fentanyl-related tariff reduction included in the deal may add only a “marginal” 0.2% to China’s growth forecast next year, she added.Economic indicators reinforce the gloom. China’s factory-gate prices dropped for the 36th consecutive month in September. Retail sales rose just 3% year-on-year, the slowest pace in 10 months, and new home prices posted their sharpest fall in nearly a year. Even China’s electric vehicle industry is stuck in a downward price spiral caused by excess capacity.For now, the understanding between the leaders is only a draft. Final details require further negotiations, and there is no guarantee that the agreement will be formalised.What has been taken off the table, at least temporarily, is Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese exports, a move that would almost certainly have prompted retaliation from Beijing.","The US and China have reached a provisional deal on trade.

President said that a private donor, identified by media reports as billionaire , provided funds to maintain military pay, CBS News reported. Up to $14 billion economic loss: The CBO warns that a shutdown lasting eight weeks or more would permanently erase $14 billion from GDP.





The United States is nearing the longest federal government shutdown in history, having remained closed for the entire month with no resolution in sight.Economists have warned that the longer the impasse drags on, the greater the risk that the economy, already showing signs of strain, could shift from bending to breaking.“The economy is fragile and, therefore, something like a government shutdown could become a bigger problem a lot faster than people might think,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, as quoted by CNN.Fresh estimates released this week by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) show the shutdown has already shaved off at least $7 billion in economic output permanently. Furthermore, the economic damage will rise the longer the shutdown continues, with losses reaching $11 billion after six weeks, and $14 billion if it stretches to eight weeks.Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, compared the cascading effects to a snowball gathering mass, “That’s kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering momentum and mass.”The shutdown comes on top of an already weak labour market, defined by low hiring, low firing and minimal movement. Employers have been delaying investments and staffing decisions because of financial and policy uncertainty, while some companies have begun testing artificial intelligence and automation, resulting in mass layoffs.“We’re not creating any jobs of consequence, really,” Zandi said.As the job market is already weak, the small number of jobs being added could turn into actual job losses. If government support systems weaken, federal workers miss paychecks, and people spend less money, businesses might start firing workers or closing down.A report by the US Chamber of Commerce cited by CNN suggested that 65,500 small business contractors have $12 billion worth of payments at risk this month due to paused government operations.Nicole Bachaud, labour economist at ZipRecruiter, said that the interest rate cuts and trade clarity were expected to boost hiring in 2026 and that momentum could be derailed.“However, tariffs are projected to dampen consumer spending before year’s end, and a prolonged shutdown could further erode consumer confidence,” she wrote. The Conference Board’s latest index reflects that trend, showing consumer sentiment at its lowest level since April.The political deadlock hinges on the expiry of enhanced subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Democrats insist the funding bill must extend the subsidies; Republicans refuse to discuss it until the government reopens.Open enrollment begins 1 November, and without renewed subsidies, 22 million Americans using the federal marketplace could see premiums spike by 26% on average, according to a KFF analysis, quoted by CNN.That same day, more than 65,000 children and families in 41 states and Puerto Rico risk losing access to Head Start early education programmes.Temporary closures would add financial pressure on low-income households and lead to immediate childcare disruptions, a factor known to weigh on workforce participation, particularly for women.Economists warn that delayed or cancelled spending, job hires, travel, even holiday shopping, may not return later.“And this isn’t economic activity that is just deferred or delayed, you’re now creating a condition of economic activity that just simply doesn’t happen,” said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist.Zandi added that the broader economy reaches a critical stage when confidence begins to crack, “When this thing really metastasizes and takes out the broader economy is when it starts to affect confidence – consumer, business, investor confidence – the stock market takes notice and instead of going straight up, it starts to wobble and starts going down.” If the shutdown stretches beyond Thanksgiving, he warned, “there’s no coming back from that quickly. ”A prolonged stalemate may also influence inflation and interest rate decisions. Disruptions could push some prices higher, but weaker demand could pull inflation lower.“The net of all that, I think, is hard to know,” Zandi told CNN, noting the Federal Reserve may feel more pressure to continue cutting rates as the job market suffers.“The Fed’s putting a higher weight at this point on the weak job market than they are on inflation or financial conditions.”He further added that this shutdown would weaken the already fragile job market more.Millions relying on federal aid programmes, including food assistance under SNAP, face increasing uncertainty. For many households already struggling with inflation, any delay in government support could deepen hardship.Zandi said that majority of the Americans are “not taking any solace from the fact that AI stocks are going stratospheric; they’re focused on having to make their credit card payment or the student loan monthly payment.’”“It just adds insult to injury on an economy that was already showing some cracks,” Swonk said, adding, “Low- and middle-income households are really struggling, and inequality tends to stoke political divisions as well as political backlash. So, this is just feeding in to already a not very comfortable situation that we are in.”“It’s hard when you see the struggles we’re already facing, but this is a man-made problem,” she said.The shutdown entered October after Congress failed yet again to agree on a temporary funding bill. The House passed a measure on 19 September to keep the government open until 21 November, but it stalled immediately in the Republican-controlled Senate.It is now the second-longest shutdown in US history, just days short of the 34-day standoff of 2018–2019.","The United States is nearing the longest federal government shutdown in history, having remained closed for the entire month with no resolution in sight.Economists have warned that the longer the impasse drags on, the greater the risk that the economy, already showing signs of strain, could shift from bending to breaking.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125009915,imgsize-792185,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

Going downhill

Settling the feud

A new chapter





Months after US President Donald Trump settled a $16 million lawsuit with CBS News, he is set to return to “60 Minutes” this Sunday, marking his first appearance on the programme since the dispute.CBS confirmed that Norah O’Donnell conducted the interview at Mar-a-Lago on Friday. The network has, however, not disclosed how this week’s interview was arranged, nor whether any terms were set in advance.Although O’Donnell, although is a former “CBS Evening News” anchor, she is not among the regular correspondents of “60 Minutes”.The interview will be aired this Sunday, according to AP.The president's relationship with the network and with the long-running newsmagazine, has been turbulent.Back in run-up to the 2020 election, Trump abruptly ended an interview with correspondent Lesley Stahl, accusing the show of bias, and later his team released an unedited transcript.Despite repeated overtures from the programme, he did not sit for an interview during the 2024 campaign. Trump would later accuse “60 Minutes” of editing its interview with Kamala Harris “deceptively” to present her more favourably.Though CBS News denied the claim, maintaining that the Harris interview was edited according to routine editorial standards, Trump responded with legal action. He demanded the network $10 billion in damages but then raised the demand to $20 billion.Although legal experts largely dismissed Trump’s lawsuit as meritless and unlikely to stand because of constitutional press protections, Paramount chose to pursue mediation instead, a move made as the company was working to close its $8 billion merger with Skydance.The matter was resolved when Paramount, the network’s parent company, paid Trump $16 million, back in July, to settle the case. The payment came weeks before the Federal Communications Commission approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance Media, led by new CEO David Ellison.The lawsuit had internal consequences at CBS. Bill Owens, the executive producer of “60 Minutes”, stepped down in the spring, saying he could no longer run the programme independently. This was followed by the resignation of CBS News chief executive Wendy McMahon in May.Although Paramount did not apologise or acknowledge any fault, the company agreed as part of the settlement to release transcripts of future “60 Minutes” interviews with presidential candidates.Trump has been signalling improved relations with the broadcaster, since David Ellison assumed control at Paramount this summer. Ellison is the son of Larry Ellison, a prominent Trump supporter.Under his leadership, the company hired Kenneth Weinstein, the former head of a conservative think tank and a donor to Trump’s 2024 campaign, to review complaints alleging bias in the network’s journalism.During a flight home from the Middle East on October 12, Trump supported Ellisons’ role in the reshaped media landscape. “Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They're friends of mine. They're big supporters of mine, and they'll do the right thing,” he told reporters.Paramount has also expanded its footprint in political and opinion media. In October, the company purchased the Free Press website and appointed its founder, Bari Weiss, as editor-in-chief of CBS News.Weiss is reported to have helped secure a recent “60 Minutes” segment featuring Jared Kushner and Trump associate Steve Witkoff discussing the Gaza peace deal.",US President Donald Trump set to return to '60 Minutes' this Sunday.

American investment company BlackRock reported to have fallen prey to a multi-million-dollar 'breathtaking' fraud allegedly orchestrated by Bankim Brahmbhatt, the Indian-origin CEO of a US-based telecom company, Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice. The Wall Street Journal reported that lenders have accused Brahmbhatt's company of fabricating accounts receivable that were supposed to be used as loan collateral and now the CEO's companies owe them more than $500 million. Brahmbhatt's lawyer told Journal that the CEO disputed the fraud allegations.HPS, the private credit card investment arm of BlackRock, began lending to at least one financing arm affiliated with Brahmbhatt’s telecom companies in September 2020.

Amazon’s stellar quarterly results helped Wall Street stay near record highs on Friday, with the S&P 500 hovering around its all-time peak set earlier in the week, capping what could be its sixth straight monthly gain — the longest winning streak since 2021.The S&P 500 was virtually flat after paring morning gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 102 points, or less than 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite edged up 0.4%, buoyed by Big Tech earnings, AP reported.Amazon shares jumped 10.3%, emerging as the strongest driver of market gains after the company posted a quarterly profit that far exceeded analysts’ expectations. CEO Andy Jassy said growth in its cloud-computing unit has “reaccelerated back to a pace it hasn’t seen since 2022.”Given Amazon’s massive $2.4 trillion valuation, its stock movement significantly influences the S&P 500. Apple, the world’s largest company by market capitalisation at over $4 trillion, traded between modest gains and losses, last up 0.1%. It also reported stronger-than-expected profits, with CEO Tim Cook crediting robust iPhone and services revenue for the beat.Elsewhere, Reddit jumped 12.1% after reporting higher profit and revenue than analysts projected, while Coinbase Global rose 6.8% on better-than-expected earnings.Netflix climbed 3.3% after announcing a 10-for-1 stock split to make shares more affordable without altering investor holdings.These gains helped offset a 4.8% slide in AbbVie, whose quarterly results, though above expectations, fell short of the strong beats investors had become accustomed to. Analysts noted expectations were high after the drugmaker’s stock surged 28.4% this year.Market analysts said investor focus remains on whether corporate earnings growth can justify elevated stock valuations. The S&P 500 had dropped 1% on Thursday as concerns grew over soaring capital expenditure plans by Meta Platforms and Microsoft amid the AI investment race.Adding to the cautious tone, financial markets showed scepticism that President Donald Trump’s trade truce with China would fully ease tensions. Microsoft and Meta fell further on Friday, down 1.6% and 2.2% respectively, dragging the broader market.In overseas markets, European indices slipped following a mixed Asian session. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.4% and Shanghai’s Composite dropped 0.8% after data showed China’s factory activity contracted for a seventh consecutive month — its fastest decline in six months. Japan’s Nikkei 225 bucked the trend, rising 2.1% to a record high after September industrial output exceeded forecasts.In the bond market, US Treasury yields eased slightly after a midweek spike triggered by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s caution that another interest rate cut in December “is not a foregone conclusion — far from it.” The 10-year yield dipped to 4.09% from 4.11% but remained above Monday’s 3.99%.According to Bank of America’s Global Research report, several central banks have paused rate cuts or hinted at doing so, suggesting “this is it for the 2025 easing season in developed economies.”","The S&P 500 was virtually flat after paring morning gains, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 102 points, or less than 0.2%.

China diversifies

soybean purchases





Soybean trade between the US and China is set to resume after months of halted purchases. Beijing had refused to purchase American soybean after the two nations got embroiled in tariff tensions.Now, China has agreed to buy 12 million metric tonnes from the United States in the ongoing season till January. However, this is still significantly lower than the 22.5 million tonnes purchased in the previous season.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the development on Thursday, saying China has also committed to purchasing 25 million tonnes annually over the next three years under a broader trade agreement. The commitment was reached following talks between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.The decline in Chinese purchases came as a hit for the US farmers who lost billions in sales. The deal would, hence, come as a return to normalcy with the top US soybean importer. Over the past five crop years, China’s annual purchases averaged 28.8 million tonnes from September to August, Reuters reported.“Our great soybean farmers, who the Chinese used as political pawns - that's off the table, and they should prosper in the years to come,” Bessent said on Fox Business Network's Mornings with Maria. He further added that the agreement negotiated in Malaysia over the weekend could be formally signed as early as next week.Alongside China’s commitments, Bessent said other Southeast Asian countries have agreed to buy an additional 19 million tonnes of US soybeans, though he did not specify the timeframe or which countries are involved. According to US Census Bureau data, other Asian importers typically purchase between 8 and 10 million tonnes annually.The commodity markets responded immediately. The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade erased earlier losses and finished 1.2% higher, settling at a 15-month peak of $11.07-3/4 per bushel. Export prices for US soybeans have surged by $20 to $30 per metric tonne this week, driven by expectations of renewed Chinese demand after the Trump–Xi meeting. Roughly 180,000 tonnes, three cargoes, were sold to state trader COFCO just before the summit.Farm groups have welcomed the breakthrough after the prolonged trade war slashed soy exports that were worth $24.5 billion last year. US farmers are nearing completion of what is expected to be the fifth-largest soybean harvest on record, but weak Chinese demand and rising costs for fertiliser, seed, labour and machinery have squeezed farm incomes.“This is a meaningful step forward to reestablishing a stable, long-term trading relationship that delivers results for farm families and future generations,” American Soybean Association President and Kentucky farmer Caleb Ragland told Reuters.The breakthrough comes after Trump secured agricultural trade understandings with other Asian economies. American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said, “Expanding markets and restoring purchases by China will provide some certainty for farmers who are struggling just to hold on.”Trump announced on social media after the meeting with Xi that China had authorised purchases of “massive amounts” of soybeans, sorghum and other US farm products. US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins later praised Trump’s comment in a post on X.However, analysts say the arrangement largely resets the trade relationship to previous levels rather than marking an expansion. Even Rogers Pay, director at Beijing-based Trivium China, said the agreement “effectively constituted a return to business as usual”, adding, “It targets a level of trade that has been pretty consistent with the past few years.”Further details will determine whether private Chinese importers return to the US market. Johnny Xiang, founder of Beijing-based AgRadar Consulting, said commercial buyers are waiting to see if soybean tariffs will be lowered from 20% to 10%, or removed entirely.“If the tariff is not completely lifted, commercial buyers will have little incentive to purchase US soybeans,” he told Reuters.China, the world’s largest soybean importer, used its massive demand as leverage during the earlier Trump-era trade war. Facing tariffs of 23%, Chinese buyers shifted towards South American suppliers. Since then, China has intentionally diversified its import sources. Customs data shows that in 2024, only 20% of China’s soybean imports came from the United States, a steep drop from 41% in 2016.","Soybean trade between the US and China is set to resume after months of halted purchases.

Is America running out of pennies? Trump’s cost-cutting plan leaves retailers counting losses; what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/america-runs-out-of-pennies-trumps-common-cents-plan-to-save-cashretailers-left-counting-losses/articleshow/124980444.cms,"'Trump Using Hunger For Bargain': Shockwaves In U.S. Over SNAP Cuts As Shutdown Explodes

'Wanted it to go—but not like this!'

High cost, less worth—Pennies go away

Common Cents Act

How is it impacting government and retailers





America is running out of pennies, quite literally!The US is facing a nationwide shortage of pennies, months after President Donald Trump halted production of the one-cent coin without introducing a transition plan.The decision, which came as a cost-saving measure, is now impacting the country’s commerce. In many shops and banks, staff are struggling to handle cash transactions without the smallest denomination coin.Retailers in several states have exhausted their penny supplies and can no longer provide exact change to customers paying with cash. Banks, meanwhile, say they are receiving no new stock and have begun rationing pennies to their clients.One regional chain, Sheetz, even tried to lure the coins back into circulation by offering customers a free soda in exchange for 100 pennies. Another business has warned that the shortage will cost millions this year because it is rounding transactions down to avoid legal challenges.“It’s a chunk of change,” Dylan Jeon, senior director of government relations with the National Retail Federation, told AP.The strain first became visible in late summer and is intensifying as retailers prepare for the busy holiday trading period.“We have been advocating abolition of the penny for 30 years. But this is not the way we wanted it to go,” said Jeff Lenard with the National Association of Convenience Stores.Banks said that they received little warning. Troy Richards, president of Guaranty Bank & Trust Co in Louisiana, told AP that penny deliveries abruptly stopped in August.“We got an email announcement from the Federal Reserve that penny shipments would be curtailed. Little did we know that those shipments were already over for us,” Richards said.The $1,800 worth of pennies his branches held disappeared within a fortnight. Only small, controlled amounts are now given to cheque-cashing customers.The sudden halt has also left companies pleading with consumers to pay with exact change.However, despite these struggles, not one retailer or bank is pushing to restore production of the coin, disliked due to its weight and limited use.“We don’t want the penny back. We just want some sort of clarity from the federal government on what to do, as this issue is only going to get worse,” the NACS’ Lenard said.A few days into his second term, on February 9, President Trump announced that the US will stop minting pennies, calling the decision part of a broader effort to streamline government spending. Both the penny and nickel have been more expensive to produce as compared to their costs.The US Mint’s latest report shows why: it cost 3.7 cents to make a penny in 2024, and 13.8 cents to produce a nickel.“Let’s rip the waste out of our great nation’s budget, even if it’s a penny at a time,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.The treasury department placed its final order for blank copper-zinc planchets ( metal disks that are minted into coins) in May. The last penny was minted in June and, by August, the remaining stocks were dispatched to banks and cash-handling companies.A bill, Common Cents Act, currently in Congress, proposes standardising cash payments by rounding to the nearest nickel. Businesses are open to it, but consumer advocates warn that rounding up could increase costs for shoppers.The treasury department has not responded to requests for guidance on how retailers and banks should manage the growing disruption.Other countries took years to phase out low-value coins. Canada announced the end of its one-cent piece in 2012 and eased out of using it through 2013, while Britain’s shift to the decimal system stretched across much of the 1960s and early 1970s.By contrast, the US removed the penny from circulation within months, and without legislative backing, a move that has left banks and retailers demanding clarity.The Mint: Despite issuing 3.23 billion pennies in 2024, more than any other US coin, most do not return to circulation. Americans tend to hoard pennies in jars or keep them as decor, forcing the Mint to manufacture billions each year. By ending production, the treasury expects to save $56 million, while the Mint remains profitable overall, generating $182 million in seigniorage last year through other coins and collectors’ sets.Compounding the issue, almost a third of the Federal Reserve’s coin distribution terminals are now closed to both penny withdrawals and deposits. That means regions that still have spare pennies have no way to send them to regions running out.“As a result of the US department of the treasury’s decision to end production of the penny, coin distribution locations accepting penny deposits and fulfilling orders will vary over time as (penny) inventory is depleted,” a Federal Reserve spokeswoman said.Retailers: Retailers now face legal complications. In several states, rounding cash transactions up to the nearest nickel is illegal, as it would unfairly disadvantage cash customers compared with card users.To avoid lawsuits, stores are rounding down instead, a policy that comes with a financial hit. Kwik Trip, a convenience chain in the Midwest, says rounding down at tills could cost it around $3 million this year. Others are encouraging customers to donate loose change at counters to avoid handling pennies altogether.","President Donald Trump halted production of the one-cent coin without introducing a transition plan.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

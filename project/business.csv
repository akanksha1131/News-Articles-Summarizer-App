"World Bank clears Rs 5,700 crore for 'Jal Sanrakshit' Haryana, canal revival and micro-irrigation at core",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/world-bank-clears-rs-5700-crore-for-jal-sanrakshit-haryana-canal-revival-and-micro-irrigation-at-core/articleshow/127413697.cms,"AI image

The World Bank has approved technical and financial assistance of Rs 5,700 crore for Haryana under the ‘Jal Sanrakshit Haryana Project’, aimed at making the state self-reliant in the water sector, Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini said on Saturday.Chairing a review meeting on the programme, Saini said the funds will be released in phases between 2026 and 2032 and will be used primarily for large-scale canal restoration, micro-irrigation, groundwater recharge and sustainable agriculture initiatives.According to the official plan, Haryana has 1,570 canals, of which 892 have been restored over the past two decades. The remaining 678 canals are proposed to be completed over the next five years. This includes restoration of 115 canals at a cost of Rs 2,325 crore with World Bank support, 284 canals costing Rs 2,230 crore from the state budget, and 279 canals worth Rs 2,880 crore through NABARD funding.The Chief Minister said similar work is planned for minor canals. Of the 15,562 minor canals under the Micro Irrigation & Command Area Development Authority, 4,487 have already been restored, while 1,961 will be taken up over the next five years.This includes 400 minor canals costing Rs 450 crore with World Bank assistance, 1,500 minor canals worth Rs 1,250 crore funded by the state, and 61 canals costing Rs 402 crore through NABARD.With World Bank support of Rs 900 crore, micro-irrigation systems will also be implemented across nearly 70,000 acres of farmland. The Agriculture Department will develop tube-well-based and surface drainage systems to address waterlogging across around 2 lakh acres, while crop diversification, direct seeding of rice and other water-conservation practices will be promoted with assistance of about Rs 886 crore.The project also includes construction of around 80 new water bodies in southern Haryana to boost groundwater recharge. Treated water from sewage treatment plants in Jind, Kaithal and Gurugram will be reused to irrigate nearly 28,000 acres, supported by World Bank funding of about Rs 600 crore.Saini said the World Bank described the ‘Jal Sanrakshit Haryana’ programme as a “paradigm shift” in the state’s water management approach. He added that once completed, the entire canal network would be fully lined and capable of operating efficiently for the next 25 years, reducing the need for repeated restoration spending.On completion, irrigation facilities will expand to an additional 2 lakh acres, farmers will get relief from waterlogging, and fresh water currently used for irrigation can be conserved for drinking purposes, the Chief Minister said, urging farmers to adopt micro-irrigation systems, particularly for paddy cultivation.","The funds will be released in phases between 2026 and 2032.

Investors’ expectations from Union Budget 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/investors-expectations-from-union-budget-2026/articleshow/127404991.cms,"By Devendra Agrawal

For Investors:

For angel investors:

Deloitte Partner Says Budget Must Fix GST Gaps, Cut Costs, Boost Domestic Manufacturing

Bring sale of AIF units at par with sale of shares.

Government as venture debt provider.

Invest wisely in deep tech:

For taxation:

a) Introduce taxation at household level.

b) Widen India’s tax net.

(Devendra Agrawal, Founder, Dexter Capital Advisors, a boutique investment bank)

The recent Supreme Court judgement that has gone against Tiger Global may dampen the confidence of any global investor because anything that’s agreed in the past is open for interpretation. And while that may lead to short-term benefit of recovering the taxes from one investor, in the long run it might have a negative impact on the larger investor community. They may feel the country may not be trusted with the laws laid by the previous governments. The budget should provide clarity or simplify the laws, especially for global investors.Ideally, the government should unleash private capital for startups. The recent SEBI regulations for angel investing have increased the accreditation. Earlier, any individual/HUFs/Family Trusts/Sole proprietorships with net worth greater than Rs 2 crore (excluding the value of their primary residence) could be angel investors. Now, the net worth has to be equal or greater than Rs 7.5 cr, out of which at least Rs 3.75 cr is in the form of financial assets (excluding the value of their primary residence).If someone keeps PPP (purchasing power parity) in mind, it is ridiculously high and removes a number of people from the purview of investing.The government should definitely make a uniform policy for accredited investors but with fewer norms. And before angel investors, I think, the government should look at F&Os as they are even riskier and more speculative. Angel investing drives capital formation.When any investor invests in any Alternate Investment Fund (AIF), the investor gets units of AIF. Now, often these investments are illiquid and AIF units can't be easily transferred. If an investor gets a willing buyer to transfer the AIF unit, another challenge is that AIF units are valued on Fair Market Value (FMV).In comparison, when underlined securities like shares in a company are sold, the transaction does not need to be at FMV, as long as they are sold above book value.So, there's a disparity between sale of IAF units vs sale of shares of underlying companies held by these AIFs.Doing away this disparity can bring selling of AIF units at par with selling shares and would increase liquidity in a situation where an investor in AIF wants to sell AIF units.This would definitely bring more liquidity, increase participation of investors in alternate investment funds.This is completely as per the tax laws of the country. It's just that the finance ministry has not taken this into consideration in record.The government recently approved Rs 5,000 crore in equity support for the SIDBI to help expand credit flow to the MSME sector. The government invests in startups at a 6% rate with secured assets. To help more startups raise capital from the government and for the government to benefit from it, the government may consider investing at an increased rate – 8% – but without a secured asset as long as the startup is certified and thoroughly evaluated.This could help in bringing down India’s very high venture debt, at 13-18%. The government could provide, say, a tech-driven company which has built a prototype, an 8% yield and can have a warrant structure. So that such a portfolio asset has mortality. Those warrants will yield a much higher rate of return even if a small percentage, like less than 10% of these companies, become wildly successful. So, the government could become a de facto venture debt provider or a collateral-free loan provider.The government recently built a Rs 1 lakh crore fund for deep tech without having a very clear definition of deep tech. This amount is slightly on the higher side in terms of deep tech. The government could probably allocate a certain portion of this fund towards deep tech and the remaining fund could be allocated towards other avenues as well.We should applaud the Finance Minister and the government for two big releases. First, for rationalizing taxes to INR 12 lakh for the common man. Second, the GST reform. However, there are two recommendations that I would like to make:India follows an individual-focused income tax system, where each person’s annual income is evaluated and then taxed.Introducing taxation at household level will give assesses the scope for rationalizing/reducing their tax burden. Assesses should have the option of filing their returns as a household or as an individual.If the cumulative income of a household is lesser than a particular threshold, then taxation should be lesser. For example, if a household consisting of a married couple--where both husband and wife are earning—has a cumulative income of Rs 30 lakh then the tax rate could be 20% and not the current 30%.The idea behind household-level taxation is that the family’s ability to pay depends on the shared expenses, not just individual income. This concept could definitely be explored and introduced.Less than 4% of the population pays income tax in India. This increases the tax burden on the salaried class, middle class. In comparison, ~60% of households in the US pay federal income tax and ~10-14% of the Chinese working population pays income tax. The government and other stakeholders should find a way to bring more working people under the tax bracket to reduce the overall tax burden on the salaried class. I feel one way to do this could be to incentivize high tax payers by publicly recognizing and rewarding them.","The recent Supreme Court judgement that has gone against Tiger Global may dampen the confidence of any global investor because anything that’s agreed in the past is open for interpretation.Ideally, the government should unleash private capital for startups.

Can Donald Trump’s mortgage bond push lower home loan rates? New Fannie–Freddie limits reignite risk debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/can-donald-trumps-mortgage-bond-push-lower-home-loan-rates-new-fanniefreddie-limits-reignite-risk-debate/articleshow/127409921.cms,"Cap hike revives post-crisis risk concerns



Political pressure meets market scepticism



Pulte’s tenure under scrutiny



The Trump administration has quietly expanded the scope for government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy far more mortgage bonds than previously allowed, a move aimed at lowering home loan rates but one that has revived concerns about financial risk and policy overreach.According to an internal email obtained by the Associated Press, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), under director Bill Pulte, has lifted portfolio caps that earlier limited Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to holding no more than $40 billion each in mortgage bonds. The January 12 directive raises that ceiling to $225 billion apiece, effective immediately, AP reported.If fully utilised, the change would allow the two lenders to increase bond purchases by roughly $170 billion beyond the $200 billion buying programme President Donald Trump had publicly ordered to push mortgage rates lower.The move effectively reverses nearly two decades of bipartisan policy consensus put in place after the 2008–09 financial crisis, when excessive risk-taking by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac forced a government bailout and placed both firms under federal conservatorship.While both entities remain subject to a broader Treasury cap of $450 billion on mortgage investment portfolios, analysts say the new flexibility allows them to adopt a far more aggressive approach to bond buying, potentially increasing systemic risk.Neither Pulte nor the FHFA clarified whether Trump or Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was consulted before the caps were raised. After the report surfaced, Pulte dismissed it as “fake news” on X, saying FHFA had merely given “legal flexibility” and that the firms would not exceed $200 billion in purchases.Following publication, the agency issued an additional statement saying, “Fannie and Freddie will not be allowed to go beyond the president’s buy.”The expansion comes amid heightened political pressure to show progress on mortgage affordability ahead of US midterm elections. However, lawmakers and economists remain sceptical that bond purchases alone can sustainably lower rates without addressing housing supply constraints.“This is just a smoke screen for Trump and Bill Pulte to tweet about — it will do little, if anything, to lower mortgage interest rates over the long term and raises questions about increased risks to Fannie and Freddie,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee.Housing experts also note that any temporary dip in borrowing costs could simply translate into higher home prices if supply remains tight.Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute described Trump’s initial bond-buying plan as a “sugar high,” adding that “it may have an effect, but it will be fleeting.”The episode adds to scrutiny of Bill Pulte’s unusually high-profile tenure at FHFA, a role traditionally kept out of political spotlight. Pulte has appointed himself chair of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, overseen senior management firings, and pushed controversial policy ideas, including a 50-year mortgage proposal that critics say would sharply raise long-term borrowing costs.The FHFA email instructed the two firms to increase bond investments to “exert meaningful downward pressure” on mortgage rates, and notably said that the “commencement of increases” would not require prior agency approval — a point that has raised further alarm among market watchers.“It's easy for the federal government to make a mistake here. They've done it in the past,” said Jim Parrott, a former National Economic Council official under President Barack Obama.With mortgage rates once again a political flashpoint, critics warn that loosening constraints on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac risks reopening old fault lines in the US housing finance system, even as the long-term impact on affordability remains uncertain.","Government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy far more mortgage bonds than previously allowed. The move is aimed at lowering home loan rates but has revived concerns about financial risk and policy overreach.

US Fed set to keep rates steady as officials defend independence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-fed-set-to-keep-rates-steady-as-officials-defend-independence/articleshow/127444298.cms,"External pressure

The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it meets in the coming week, holding firm despite President Donald Trump's pressure to slash levels as it guards against threats to its independence.The central bank has cut rates three consecutive times since September as the jobs market weakened, bringing them to a range between 3.50 percent and 3.75 percent.But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the bar would be higher for a further reduction in January. They meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.""The fact that growth is strong, unemployment is low, equity markets are close to all-time highs and inflation is above target all argue for a pause,"" said analysts at ING bank.Powell's robust defense of Fed independence in response to ongoing pressure from Trump to lower rates confirms this, ING added.On January 11, Powell released a rare, solemn statement revealing that the Department of Justice was investigating him over a $2.5 billion renovation of the bank's headquarters.He slammed the threat of criminal charges as the result of policymakers setting rates in the public's best interests -- rather than bowing to the president's wishes.Trump has made no secret of his disdain for Powell, claiming there is ""no inflation"" and repeatedly questioning the Fed chair's competence and integrity.Yet, US inflation has been well above the bank's two-percent target for over five years, said former Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester.""I think the Fed needs to keep a pretty tight eye on where the inflation is going,"" she told AFP.Price increases could cool after Trump's trade tariffs filter through the world's biggest economy, but Mester flagged the need for ""more convincing evidence.""Meanwhile, existing cost hikes have brought about a ""large wedge"" between how affluent and lower-income households view the economy, said KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk.Even if the gap could temporarily narrow as fiscal stimulus hits in early 2026 -- with a rise in tax refunds incoming due to tax cut expansions -- this could ""cause a more entrenched bout of inflation,"" she warned.Another complication is stagnating employment, forcing policymakers to walk a tightrope between lowering rates to boost the economy and keeping them higher to curb inflation.The Fed meets eight times a year to consider interest rate levels, and Michael Pearce of Oxford Economics said the dilemma it faces has eased.Figures suggest that risks to the labor market appear less pressing than a few months ago, while the likelihood of rising inflation also seems to have moderated, he said in a note.Nonetheless, events outside of the rate-setting committee ""have the potential to shake up the path of monetary policy,"" Pearce added.Besides the probe into Powell, Trump has sought to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, sparking a legal battle crucial to shaping how much discretion the president has in changing the Fed's leadership.A president can only fire Fed board members ""for cause,"" traditionally understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty.But the Trump administration appears to be pushing a broader interpretation, as Trump moved to fire Cook over mortgage fraud allegations she denies.The Supreme Court heard arguments on the issue on Wednesday, and Cook stressed in a statement afterwards the importance of insulating the Fed from political threats.She said her case is about whether the Fed will set rates ""guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure.""Pearce flagged a ""small risk"" that the government succeeds in ousting Cook, saying this could ""pave the way for a substantial dovish transformation on the committee over time.""Policymakers seen as ""hawkish"" favor higher rates to fight inflation, while a ""dovish"" Fed tends towards lower levels.Analysts expect Powell to avoid discussing political issues at his press briefing after the two-day Fed meeting on Wednesday, while divisions remain over the path of future policy.","The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it meets in the coming week.

Of these, 20 projects worth Rs 5,300 crore have been completed, while the remaining 36 projects, valued at Rs 18,700 crore, are at various stages of implementation.Sonowal also noted that the Cochin Port Authority and Cochin Shipyard Ltd are playing a pivotal role in strengthening the state’s maritime ecosystem.","India’s maritime sector is projected to attract investments of more than Rs 80 lakh crore in the coming years.

"New national electricity policy proposes automatic, annual tariff increase",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-national-electricity-policy-proposes-automatic-annual-tariff-increase/articleshow/127412696.cms,"LUCKNOW: The proposal to automatically raise electricity bills every year — even if state regulators fail to issue timely tariff orders — has ignited controversy over India’s new draft National Electricity Policy (NEP), 2026.The Union ministry of power published the draft policy on Jan 20, inviting comments and suggestions from stakeholders within 30 days. Among its many financial reforms, one buried in Clause 2 under Section 4 on ‘Financial Viability and Competitiveness’, states: “From FY 2026-27, tariffs must be linked to a suitable index for automatic annual revision which operates if no tariff order is passed by the State Commission. ”In simple terms, if a state electricity regulatory commission (SERC) misses its deadline to issue a new tariff order, power tariffs would automatically increase based on an inflation-linked index, such as the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) or Consumer Price Index (CPI). The exact formula remains undefined.Officials argue that this “enabling provision” is a necessary backstop. A source from the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) said that the intent was to prevent utilities from bleeding financially in case of regulatory delays.“The idea is to allow an automatic increase for a defined period until the Commission decides,” the source said, stressing “it is not a blank cheque”.“The automatic increase should be subject to the filing of a petition by the utility,” he said.If a utility fails to file its tariff proposal on time, hikes would stop. The mechanism is meant to be a temporary bridge only when the regulatory process itself is delayed beyond the mandated 120-day window.However, consumer rights advocates see a dangerous overreach. Avadhesh Kumar Verma, chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad and a member of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission’s advisory committee, has termed the provision “legally untenable”.“It strips SERCs of their core statutory duty. The revised policy proposes automatic cost recovery, without express Commission approval,” he said.He contended that sections 61, 62, and 86 of the Electricity Act, 2003, vest exclusive tariff-setting power with the commissions, and no policy could make tariffs self-executing.With the consultation window open, the automatic-tariff clause is poised to become the focal point as some view indexation as a practical tool for financial stability in a sector where discoms debts exceed Rs 7 lakh crore.Consumer groups, however, warned that it undermines due process, hampers consumer protection and could lead to unchecked hikes.","The Union ministry of power published the draft policy on Jan 20, inviting comments and suggestions from stakeholders within 30 days.

New residential supply also moderated, falling 6% to 3,61,096 units from 3,85,221 units a year earlier, the lowest level of new launches since 2021, the report said.The slowdown was also visible at a quarterly level. In the October–December quarter of 2025, housing sales fell 10% year-on-year and 0.5% quarter-on-quarter to 95,049 units, the weakest quarterly performance since the April–June quarter of 2023.“2025 was not a year of demand destruction, but one of recalibration.

However, for the full year, total supply additions were down 6% compared with 2024, underscoring developers’ cautious approach amid moderating demand.Despite lower transaction volumes, residential prices continued to edge higher across key markets, as developers largely avoided aggressive discounting and maintained pricing discipline, the report said.“The housing market is transitioning into a more mature, execution-led phase,” Shetye added. “Growth in 2026 is likely to be driven by affordability, infrastructure-led micro-markets, and city-specific fundamentals rather than broad-based acceleration.”","All-India residential sales declined 12% year-on-year to 3,86,365 units in 2025 from 4,36,992 units in 2024.

Gold price prediction

today:

are touching new record highs due to heightened geopolitical tensions, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Here’s his outlook on gold prices:

Gold Performance:

In the week ending January 16, the spot gold surged nearly 2% to close at $4595. The rally in the week came on the heels of a sharp 4.6% rise in the week ending January 9.

Driven by safe haven demand as the US President on January 17 threatened 8 EU nations with 10% tariffs beginning February 1 in retaliation to their opposition to his Greenland plans, the yellow metal extended its rally to a fresh record high of $4690 on January 19.

At the time of writing this article, the shiny metal was changing hands at $4672 (MCX February contract Rs 145,500), up 1.67% for the day.

ETF and COMEX gold inventory:

As of January 16, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 99.86 MOz, highest since August 2022, and are up nearly 1% YTD, as holdings rose for the second straight week.

Registered COMEX gold inventory at 18.86 MOz, is up around 1 MOz from the cycle low of 17.86 MOz but is down over 22% from the record peak of 24.25 MOz seen on April 7.

The US Dollar Index fell around 0.15% to 99.08 on January 19 after rising for three straight weeks.Two-year and ten-year treasury yields jumped nearly 2% last week as the US President expressed doubt over the appointment of Kevin Hassett, a key proponent of lower rate policy. Trump wants to keep him at the White House.The US Bond market was closed on January 19 to observe Martin Luther King Jr Holiday.Trump rattled NATO allies over the weekend after threatening to impose 10% tariffs on 8 EU nations starting February 1 if he doesn’t get control of Greenland.Tariffs will be increased to 25% from June 1. The proposed tariff will be due and payable until a deal is reached for complete and total purchase of Greenland.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Europe was too weak to ensure Greenland’s security in an interview on Sunday.International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said it’s too early to gauge the economic impact of tensions over Greenland, though it could be a headwind for growth.EU ambassadors met on Sunday to discuss options if Trump follows through with his threats. They are considering €93 billion ($108 billion) worth of American goods. The bloc’s leaders are due to meet for an emergency summit on Thursday.The European Union is once again weighing whether to use its most powerful economic weapon — the anti-coercion instrument (ACI) — in a dispute with a major trading partner. The instrument allows the EU to deploy an array of measures in response to coercive trade tactics. It may include new fees on EU imports of US goods and services, curbs on US investments in Europe or a ban on American firms bidding for public contracts.The pending US Supreme Court ruling on some of Trump’s earlier tariffs may come as soon as Tuesday.President Trump will address the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week and may offer details of home ownership plans for helping Americans buy homes by making it possible to take money out of their 401(K)s and use that for downpayment.Bloomberg reported that respondents in a World Economic Forum survey identify 'geoeconomic confrontation' and 'state-based armed conflict' as the two biggest risks to the global backdrop in 2026.As per Axios, the US officials plan to focus on economic growth, home ownership and peace through strength at WEF, Davos.China’s data released on January 19 showed that China’s economy grew 4.5% on an annualized basis in Q4 2025 vs 4.4% expected. China’s retail sales hit a 3-year low in December, trailing the forecast. Similarly, China’s industrial production, fixed asset investment (December) trailed their respective forecasts.Last week’s data showed that US CPI (December), despite expectations of coming out to be hot on downward adjustments in the November CPI data, was tame. CPI y-o-y was up 2.7% (forecast 2.7%, prior 2.7%). The core CPI also rose 2.7% y-o-y (forecast 2.7%, prior 2.7%). Retail sales advance was up 0.6% m-o-m Vs the estimate of 0.5% and prior reading of -0.1%), while retail sales control group up 0.4% (forecast 0.4%, prior 0.6%).PPI final demand data were hotter than expected though.Industrial production data, released on Friday, was up 0.4% m-o-m (forecast 0.1%) in December.Major US data on the deck this week include 3Q GDP final reading (January 22), real personal spending (January 22), PCE Price Index (January 22) and S&P Global US PMIs, University of Michigan consumer sentiment and inflation expectations (January 23).Major Eurozone data to be released this week include CPI (January 19), services and composite PMIs (January 23). The UK’s CPI (January 21), services and composite PMIs (January 23) will also be monitored by investors.Fresh escalation in geopolitical tensions over Greenland as Trump threatens the EU nations with tariffs to achieve his goal is an unexpected development which is supporting gold prices. Heightened worries and repercussions may also affect global trade and economy. Otherwise, gold could have come under pressure due to diminishing possibility of Hassett becoming the next Fed Chair, a firmer US Dollar and thawing geopolitical tensions as Iran strike had been averted.Still, US Supreme Court ruling over Trump’s tariffs may create huge short-term volatility as his tariffs may be lacking legal basis, though the Trump Administration could resort to other clauses to keep most of the tariffs in place.Trump extending the EU tariff deadline will also weigh on the yellow metal.Spot gold may test resistance around $4750 (MCX February contract Rs 148,000) amid elevated US-EU tariff tensions.However, considering the risks involved, buyers are urged to exercise caution and to put suitable stoploss. Support is at $4608 (Rs 143,500)/$4560 (Rs 142,000). Interim resistance is at $4707 (Rs 146,500).Spot silver surged over 12% in the week ending January 16 as it closed at $89.94 on January 16.Shanghai Gold Exchange Silver price (T+D) at 23271 CNY/Kg is equivalent to around $104/Oz.US imposing tariffs on EU means that the expected flow of silver inventories from COMEX warehouses to LBMA warehouses will be disrupted, which will tighten the spot market.Spot silver, currently at $94.42 (MCX March contract Rs 309,660), up nearly 5% for the day, is expected to trade with a positive bias that will strengthen should the metal closes above $94 mark for two straight days. It may rise to test the resistance zone of $98-$100 (MCX March contract Rs 321,000-Rs 328,000). However, as mentioned earlier in the gold section, utmost caution is needed with a suitable stoploss in place. Support is at $90 (Rs 295,000)/$86 (Rs 282,000).","Gold prices touching new record highs due to heightened geopolitical tensions, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

Trump Threatens Canada With 100% Tariff Over China Trade Push After Carney’s Beijing Visit

: US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100 per cent tax on Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China, reversing his position last week when he said he was okay with such a trade deal.In a social media post on Saturday, Trump appeared to have changed his mind while lashing out at Canadian PM Mark Carney, saying “if he thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.”“China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life. If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A,” Trump said, referring to the Canadian PM as “Governor Carney.”Trump’s threat follows a remarkable address by Carney to global leaders at Davos where the Canadian PM raised the banner of revolt against U.S hegemony, warning that in a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: to compete with each other for favor or to combine to create a third path with impact.“Middle powers must act together because if we are not at the table, we are on the menu,” Carney said in an address that was widely acclaimed across the world.The open swipe at the U.S appears to have enraged Trump, who only last week had said if Carney struck a deal with China – which he did when he visited Beijing ahead of Davos – he should do it and he (Trump) was okay with it.But at Davos, where Carney was the toast of the global leadership, the U.S President turned sour, complaining that Canada gets many ""freebies"" from the US and ""should be grateful,"" and Carney's remarks showed he ""wasn't so grateful.""“Canada lives because of the United States,” Trump said in remarks that offended many Canadians and provoked Carney to retort that ""Canada does not ‘live because of the United States.’ Canada thrives because we are Canadian.""""We are masters in our own house. This is our country. This is our future. The choice is ours,” Carney asserted, stating that Canada must be a ""beacon"" in an era of ""democratic decline” and arguing that Canada’s success is built on values like inclusivity and diversity, a swipe at Trumpian America that believes whites are being displaced and sidelined by immigration.Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state, and this week he posted an altered image of a map of the US that included Canada, Greenland, Venezuela and Cuba as part of its territory. The trolling has taken its toll of two centuries of amicable U.S-Canada ties that has resulted in the longest and mostly unguarded border in the world.A 100 per cent tariff on Canadian goods and products will be devastating for Ottawa, which is Washington's second largest trade partner after Mexico. For the full year of 2025, total bilateral trade in goods and services is estimated to have crossed $900 billion, racking up a surplus of more than $85 billion.",US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100 per cent tax on Canada if it strikes a trade deal with China.

US Says 25% Tariff Forced India Oil Shift, Signals Removal, Slams EU Silence On Russian Crude

: US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled a prospective removal of the 25 per cent penalty tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil, citing “success” in Washington’s pressure tactics while appearing to disapprove the outreach of the European Union, which is on the verge of concluding a Free Trade Agreement with New Delhi.""We put 25 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and the Indian purchases by their refineries of Russian oil have collapsed. So that is a success. The tariffs are still on. I would imagine there is a path to take them off, so that's a check and a huge success,"" Bessent said in remarks at Davos, even as the US and India continued efforts to narrow gaps to conclude their own trade agreement.Bessent noted that pre-Ukraine invasion, Russia supplied only 2-3% of India's oil, which rose into the high teens but has now come down due to the US pressure via tariffs. By some estimates, there has been a 29% month-on-month reduction in Russian crude imports by India—going down to their lowest levels since 2022, but not reaching zero.He also contrasted this approach with that of Europe, criticizing the EU for not imposing similar tariffs on New Delhi and instead buying refined Russian oil products from India, calling it an ""ultimate act of irony and stupidity"" for indirectly funding Moscow’s war effort.Some critics have pointed out that the US itself was buying Russian uranium till very recently and the Trump administration’s deference towards Russia on the Ukraine issue is not helping end the war either.Bessent’s remarks came even as the EU and India are on the verge of concluding a free trade agreement that has been in the works for nearly 20 years, a development that appeared to irk Washington, which is on the rampage against rest of the world claiming the US has been “ripped off.”In a separate development, President Trump lashed out at Canada for its recent trade deals with China, threatening a 100 per cent tariff against Ottawa for turning itself into a “drop-off port” for channeling Chinese goods into the US.While Bessent held out the possibility of removing the Russian oil tariffs on India, his colleague commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, suggested last week that the U.S-India trade deal was held up because Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not picked up the phone to call President Trump.But New Delhi has rejected the claim, saying PM Modi had spoken to the President at least three or four times since op sindoor to discuss a wide range of issues. The Indian side acknowledged that he did not discuss the nitty-gritty of the trade deal, because under the Indian system, it is the officials’ remit; the prime minister does not negotiate the details.PM Modi will be happy to call President Trump when the trade deal is concluded, they said, while not putting a timeline on its conclusion.",US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled a prospective removal of the 25 per cent penalty tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil. He also criticized the EU for not imposing similar tariffs on New Delhi and instead buying refined Russian oil products from India.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127409660,imgsize-717764,width-400,resizemode-4/article-63.jpg"

We also want their research discoveries to be shared openly, to contribute to the global knowledge commons,” Teo said.The investment marks the latest in a series of measures by Singapore to deepen its AI ecosystem.

The United States has extended a temporary operating licence for Serbia's sanctioned oil company, the latter's energy minister confirmed on Friday, as negotiations continue over the exit of Russian majority shareholders.Washington's sanctions on the Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), part of its crackdown on Russia's energy sector, have previously forced a months-long shutdown of the country's only oil refinery.Production restarted earlier this month after a temporary reprieve was granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which was due to expire at midnight.But according to Serbian Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic Handanovic, the licence has now been extended until February 20.""We have secured almost an additional month for NIS to continue operating, to be supplied via the Adriatic Oil Pipeline, JANAF, and for crude to continue arriving in Serbia,"" Handanovic told local TV Pink.A previous March 24 deadline remains for negotiations over the full exit of Gazprom's interest in the company, with Hungarian energy giant MOL agreeing to basic terms with Russian firm earlier this week.After months of delay, Washington imposed sanctions on NIS on October 9, cutting off supplies to the refinery.The move has had a strong impact in Serbia, a close Kremlin ally and one of the few European states not to sanction Russia over the war in Ukraine.NIS employs about 13,500 people in Serbia and contributed over two billion euros ($2.5 billion) in tax revenue in 2024 or nearly 12 percent of the national budget.The company operates around 330 petrol stations, roughly one in five nationwide, and if acquired by MOL, the combined network would exceed 380 stations.The company also operates in Bosnia, Romania, Bulgaria and Angola.Serbia sold a majority stake in NIS to Gazprom in 2008 for 400 million euros ($470 million), with several billion invested since.NIS is currently 45 per cent owned by Gazprom Neft, which is under US sanctions, while the parent company, Gazprom, transferred its 11.3 per cent stake in September to its affiliated firm, Intelligence.The Serbian state owns nearly 30 percent, with the rest held by minority shareholders. Officials say the state intends to raise its stake by 5 percent after a sale.MOL has also confirmed that it is in talks with ADNOC, the national oil company of the United Arab Emirates, to join as a minority shareholder.",Washington's sanctions on the Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS) have previously forced a months-long shutdown of the country's only oil refinery.

US markets today: Wall Street drifts lower into quieter close; tariff walk-backs cap volatility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-markets-today-wall-street-drifts-lower-into-quieter-close-tariff-walk-backs-cap-volatility/articleshow/127297722.cms,"Photo credit- AP

US stocks edged lower on Friday as a turbulent week marked by tariff threats and reversals headed toward a calmer finish, with investors turning cautious amid limited clarity on trade and geopolitical signals.In early trade, the S&P 500 slipped 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 258 points, or 0.5%, AP reported. The Nasdaq Composite was largely flat. Markets were on track to end a second straight week with modest losses after sharp swings earlier in the week.Sentiment remained guarded after US President Donald Trump said he had reached a “framework” with Nato on Greenland, even as details remained sparse and no agreement has been signed. Trump had earlier walked back tariff threats against several European allies, which had triggered heavy volatility earlier in the week.Stock-specific moves added to pressure. Intel tumbled sharply after issuing a weaker-than-expected forecast for the first quarter, citing supply constraints despite beating profit expectations. The stock’s slide weighed on broader technology sentiment.Bond and currency markets were relatively subdued compared to earlier turbulence.Long-term Japanese government bond yields eased after spiking to record levels earlier in the week, helping calm global markets. The 40-year Japanese bond yield slipped below 4% after breaching that mark previously.In Europe, markets were mixed in midday trade, with Germany’s DAX marginally higher while France’s CAC 40 slipped. Asian markets closed mostly higher, led by gains in Japan after the Bank of Japan held rates steady and slightly upgraded its outlook for inflation and growth.Commodities traded firmer. Gold rose 0.6% to around $4,945 an ounce, while silver jumped more than 3%, nearing the $100 level, reflecting continued safe-haven demand. In energy markets, US crude rose above $60 a barrel, while Brent crude climbed past $65.Overall, markets appeared to be catching their breath after a volatile week, with investors awaiting clearer signals on trade policy and the global economic outlook.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 258 points, or 0.5%.

It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice,” Trump said. He also credited the app for boosting his appeal among younger voters, saying it “was responsible for my doing so well with the Youth Vote in the 2024 Presidential Election”.Trump further added, ""I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok."" He also thanked US vice president JD Vance and others in his administration who supported the agreement and also acknowledged Chinese President Xi Jinping for approving the arrangement, saying, “I would also like to thank President Xi, of China, for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal. He could have gone the other way, but didn’t, and is appreciated for his decision. ”Trump’s remarks came as TikTok confirmed it has finalised the formation of TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, a newly created entity intended to run its business in the United States and avoid a long-threatened ban linked to ByteDance’s Chinese ownership.Company said that the joint venture will cater to more than 200 million American users and about 7.5 million businesses. It will also operate with tighter safeguards around data protection, cybersecurity, content moderation, and the app’s recommendation algorithm.Under the ownership structure, US and international investors will jointly control 80.1% of the venture, while ByteDance will retain a 19.9% stake.

US inflation data: Fed’s preferred gauge stays above target; January rate cut pause in focus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-data-feds-preferred-gauge-stays-above-target-january-rate-cut-pause-in-focus/articleshow/127182448.cms,"Borrowing To Look Powerful? Pakistan Pays $1bn For Trump's Gaza Peace Seat While Seeking UAE Rescue

The US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure remained elevated in November, reinforcing expectations that policymakers are likely to pause further interest rate cuts as they assess the impact of earlier easing and new trade-related pressures.Data released by the US Department of Commerce on Thursday showed that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.8% year-on-year in November, marginally higher than 2.7% in October and still above the Fed’s long-term 2% inflation target, AFP reported. On a monthly basis, inflation rose 0.2% in both October and November.Consumer spending continued to show resilience, increasing 0.5% month-on-month in both October and November, though economists cautioned that the momentum may be built on weakening fundamentals.The data, which was delayed due to the prolonged US government shutdown in late 2025, is not the most current snapshot of the economy. Nevertheless, it is expected to factor into the Federal Reserve’s policy deliberations when it meets next week.After three consecutive interest rate cuts in 2025, which brought the benchmark policy rate to a range of 3.50% to 3.75%, the central bank is widely expected to hold rates steady in January.Policymakers are seen preferring to evaluate the cumulative impact of earlier rate reductions, especially as President Donald Trump’s tariff measures begin filtering through supply chains.The Fed continues to balance inflation risks against labour market conditions while adjusting borrowing costs. The persistence of inflation above target underscores the complexity of that task.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, core PCE inflation rose 2.8% year-on-year in November, up from 2.7% in October, signalling limited progress toward disinflation.Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said inflation is still likely to undershoot the Fed’s own projections over time. This, they noted, is due to “the relatively low level of tariff revenues, negligible momentum in new rents, and signs that wage growth is set to slow further.”However, they warned that despite “surprisingly resilient” consumer spending, the expansion appears fragile. “This strength looks built on increasingly shaky foundations,” economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen said in a note, pointing to pressures on real after-tax incomes.The report also showed that the personal saving rate slipped to 3.5% in November, down from 3.7% in October, a level Pantheon described as “unsustainably low.”","US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure remained elevated in November.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

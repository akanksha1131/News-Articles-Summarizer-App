Gold and silver price prediction: MCX Gold and MCX Silver have shown considerable fluctuations recently, influenced by global political events and the impact of Donald Trump's decisions regarding tariffs on market confidence. Despite gold's conventional status as a secure investment option, gold rate has declined from recent highs over the past few trading sessions.Gold prices have resumed their primary upward trend after a brief consolidation phase within the 96,000–94,500 range. This consolidation acted as a healthy pause, allowing the market to absorb previous gains before continuing its bullish momentum. The breakout from this range signals renewed buying interest and reinforces the underlying positive sentiment in the precious metals market.Currently, prices are showing strong upward momentum and are poised to test the 98,000 level in the near term. This move is supported by favorable macroeconomic conditions, including ongoing geopolitical tensions, a weak currency, and persistent inflationary concerns, all of which typically enhance gold’s appeal as a safe-haven asset.Additionally, the technical setup also suggests continued strength, with price action forming higher highs and higher lows, indicating sustained buying pressure.The overall bias remains positive as long as gold sustains above the key support level of 94,500. Any dips toward this zone may attract fresh buying interest from investors and traders looking to capitalize on the broader bullish trend. In summary, with momentum building and fundamentals supporting the move, gold prices are likely to maintain their upward trajectory, with 98,000 emerging as the next potential resistance zone.MCX Silver prices continue to exhibit strong bullish momentum, maintaining their upward trajectory with a series of higher highs and higher lows. This consistent price action reflects strong investor confidence and sustained buying interest, suggesting that the current rally has more room to run. The overall market sentiment remains positive, supported by both technical and fundamental factors.Silver prices have broken past key resistance levels in recent sessions, reinforcing the bullish trend. With this momentum, prices are expected to move towards the next significant level at 1,01,800. This target is well within reach if the current momentum persists, backed by robust demand from industrial and investment sectors. Moreover, ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, including inflationary pressures and currency volatility, continue to drive safe-haven buying in precious metals, especially silver.Technically, the structure of higher highs and higher lows is a clear indication of an ongoing uptrend. As long as this formation remains intact, we will maintain a bullish outlook. Any short-term corrections or pullbacks are likely to be viewed as buying opportunities, rather than a change in trend. In conclusion, the outlook for MCX Silver remains firmly positive, with the 1,01,800 level as the next potential target in the current upward move.CMP: 98000TARGET: 101800STOP LOSS: 95800","Gold prices have resumed their primary upward trend after a brief consolidation phase within the 96,000–94,500 range.

Nvidia announced impressive first-quarter results on Wednesday, reporting a 69% year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching $44.1 billion, surpassing Wall Street's forecast of $43.28 billion. However, the company's net profit of $18.78 billion was slightly below the anticipated $19.49 billion.Earnings per share came in at 73 cents, an increase from 61 cents a year prior.

Nvidia has warned that these restrictions could lead to $5.5 billion in charges, with CEO Jensen Huang estimating a $15 billion loss in potential sales.Analysts at Susquehanna estimated the curbs cost Nvidia about $1 billion in sales in the final three weeks of the April quarter. Wedbush analysts projected a quarterly hit between $3 billion and $4 billion. Gross margins were also expected to take a hit, forecasting an 11 percentage point drop to 67.7 per cent, partly due to write-downs related to H20 shipments, which could reduce margins by as much as 12.5 per cent.Now that Nvidia has released its financial results for the first quarter of 2026, all eyes will be on how the company navigates the twin challenges of regulatory restrictions in China and rising AI infrastructure costs.

According to Bajaj Broking Research, Aurobindo Pharma, and Gokaldas Exports are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for May 30, 2025:

Index View: NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in the broad range of 56,000-53,500 in the last 5 weeks.

A key technical observation on the daily chart is that the index has already taken 26 sessions; it has retraced just 38.2% of the prior 9-session rally (49,157–56,098), indicating a shallow pullback that suggests underlying strength and potential higher bottom formation.

We expect the index to extend the last 5 weeks’ consolidation in the range of 53,500-56,000. Only a move above 56,000 levels will signal acceleration of the up move towards 56,700 levels in the coming sessions.

Within consolidation we believe dips should be used as a buying opportunity. Key support placed at 54,000-53,500 as it is the confluence of the lower band of the last 5 weeks range, key retracement and 50 days EMA.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices extended consolidation for the second week in a row amid stock specific action. Nifty is seen consolidating in the range of 24,400-25,200. Despite facing multiple global macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds — including heightened geopolitical tensions, persistent global trade tariff uncertainties, and elevated U.S. bond yields — the Indian equity market continues to exhibit a resilient upward bias. The benchmark Nifty 50 index has sustained its positive trajectory and is now placed around the 24,800 level.From a short-term technical perspective, the market sentiment remains constructive. The index is expected to find strong demand in the support zone of 24,400–24,500. As long as this key support range is held, we anticipate the Nifty 50 to continue its bullish momentum towards the resistance at 25,200-25,300 levels in the short term.Short-term support for Nifty is placed at 24,400–24,500 levels being confluence of 20 days EMA, previous breakout area and the last 2 weeks lows.While on the higher side 25,200-25,300 remains a key hurdle area being the previous major high and 80% retracement of the entire decline (26.277-21,744).Factors that support the positive momentum in the market 1) Rate cut expectations in the monetary policy outcome (2) Above normal Monsoon Forecast by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) (3) Brent crude prices have remained in a downward trajectory, offering a major tailwind to the Indian economy, which is a net importer of crude.The stock is rebounding taking support at the rising trendline support joining lows of the last 3 months signaling buying demand at lower levels.The daily stochastic is rebounding from the oversold territory and has generated a buy signal moving above its three periods average thus validates positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 1278 levels in the coming months being the 80% retracement of the previous decline (1356-1010) and the high of April 2025.The stock is witnessing buying demand from the previous major breakout area and the confluence of 20- & 50-days EMA signaling strength and offers fresh entry opportunity.It is currently trading above the short- and long-term moving averages signaling strength and overall positive bias.The daily stochastic is rebounding from the oversold territory and has generated a buy signal moving above its three periods average thus validates positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 1090 levels in the coming months being the 123.6% external retracement of the previous decline (1060-925).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Aurobindo Pharma, and Gokaldas Exports are the top stock picks for today.

What triggers refund interest, and who pays?

Refund interest isn't a windfall for taxpayers

Interest burden manageable for the government

ITR refund is not dependent on deadline

ITR processing operational challenges

What about other interest provisions?

Final takeaway



NEW DELHI: With the Income Tax Return (ITR) filing deadline for Assessment Year 2025–26 extended from July 31 to September 15, 2025, a key question has surfaced: will this extension increase the government's interest liability on tax refunds?TOI reached out to multiple tax experts to understand the implications of this move on both taxpayers and the exchequer. What emerged is a detailed view of how refund-related interest works under Section 244A of the Income Tax Act, the potential financial burden on the government, and why taxpayers may still be better off filing early.Shalini Jain, Tax Partner, EY India, explained: “The ITR filing extended deadline (for Assessment Year 2025-26, i.e., Financial Year 2024-25) may result in the government paying more interest on tax refunds in certain cases. Considering an example where excess TDS has been deducted from the taxpayer or the taxpayer has paid excess advance tax during the Financial Year (FY), Section 244A(1)(a) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides that the taxpayer will be eligible to receive interest on the refund amount at the rate of 0.5% per month or part of a month calculated from the 1st day of April of the Assessment Year (i.e. , April 1, 2025, for AY 2025-26) up to the date on which the refund is granted.”She further noted that the interest is payable only when the refund exceeds 10% of the assessed tax liability.“Therefore, the extension of due date of filing the tax return from July 31, 2025, to September 15, 2025 may lead to higher interest being paid to taxpayers in eligible cases. Further, the taxpayers should also keep in mind that the interest received on refund is taxable in their hands as ‘income from other sources,’” Jain added.ALSO READ: ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): Deadline to file income tax returns extended from July 31 - check new date Highlighting the administrative side of the extension, Jain also pointed out a practical benefit for the Government“While there may be additional interest liability for the Government, the extended time allows the Government to make their systems ready for additional changes brought about in the income tax returns forms and accurately capture the information from TDS/TCS statements filed by tax deductors/collectors, thereby facilitating a smooth and convenient filing experience for the taxpayers.”Even with the extension, taxpayers are still entitled to receive interest on their tax refunds—provided they file their returns by the new due date of September 15, 2025.“If the Government extends the due date of filing, it would have to pay interest on refunds for the additional time of extension. The Government will need to compensate taxpayers for the extra months that their refunds are delayed,” said Ritika Nayyar, Partner at Singhania & Co., in an exclusive interaction with TOI Online.She added that interest on refunds is calculated at 0.5% per month or part thereof under Section 244A. If the return is filed on or before the due date, interest is calculated from April 1 of the assessment year until the refund is granted.To illustrate how the extended due date could impact pay-outs, Abhishek Soni, CEO and Co-founder of Tax2Win shared a breakdown of refund interest scenarios for returns filed on September 15, 2025, and processed the next day, on September 16, 2025:In another example, if the same return is filed on September 15, 2025, but the refund is processed on October 3, 2025, the interest period extends to 7 months. Here's how that plays out:These scenarios highlight how a longer refund window directly translates into higher interest payouts—an added cost that will be borne by the Income Tax Department.CA Shefali Mundra, Tax Expert at ClearTax, highlighted “If the return is filed on or before the due date u/s 139(1): Interest begins from 1 April of the assessment year till the date of grant of refund.If the return is filed after the due date u/s 139(1): Interest begins from the date of return filing to the date of grant of refund.”She illustrated the interest payable on tax refunds when ITRs are filed on September 15, 2025, with the refunds processed on September 16 and October 3, 2025, respectively.“Interest is payable only if the refund results from excess payment of TDS, TCS or advance tax and is more than 10% of the total tax liability,” Nayyar clarified. “The extra interest due to the extended deadline will be borne by the Government of India, specifically the Income Tax Department.”Despite longer interest accrual periods, delaying returns doesn’t provide major benefits to taxpayers. “There's no significant benefit by delaying to file the tax return since the government pays interest upto 6% per annum, which is almost at par, if not lower, than what banks are paying these days,” said Ankit Jain, Partner at Ved Jain and Associates.Jain pointed out that while filing closer to the deadline might earn you more interest, it’s only marginal.“If one has a refund of Rs 1,00,000 and his return is filed on September 15 with the refund processed on October 3, he gets Rs 3,500 as interest. Had he filed on July 31 and refund issued on August 18, the interest would be Rs 2,000. That’s just Rs 1,500 more—hardly a compelling reason to delay,” he explained.He added that the cost to the government is not heavy because “the coupon rate of Government borrowing is almost at the same rate.”Some tax professionals echoed the view that while the extension increases interest outflow, it’s not alarming. “Extending the ITR filing deadline could lead to the Government incurring extra interest costs under Section 244A on refunds, assuming the average ITR processing time remains consistent with the past two years. However, this additional interest would generally apply only in cases where refunds result from TDS, TCS, or advance tax payments, as interest in such instances accrues from April 1 (of the Assessment Year) until the refund is issued, provided the ITR is filed within the due date. ” said Ashish Karundia, Founder of Ashish Karundia & Co., Chartered Accountants.According to S. Sriram, Partner at Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan Attorneys, refunds are more a function of actual filing and processing than of deadlines.“Granting of a refund is not dependent upon the due date for filing of tax returns but on the actual filing of the return and its processing by the CPC. If the return is filed by July 31, the CPC can process the return earlier and grant the refund quickly,” he told TOI.He warned that filing late—even within the extended deadline—would delay refund processing and result in longer interest periods, which the Government would then have to fund.Even with a push to expedite ITR processing, challenges remain. “To mitigate the potential rise in interest liability, the Government may consider accelerating processing at the CPC,” said Ashish Karundia.He noted that refund timelines also depend on various factors: the complexity of the ITR form, nature of income, taxpayer risk profile, claims made, and cross-verification with third-party data. “Processing times can vary significantly based on these elements,” he said.Aarti Raote, Partner at Deloitte India, brought another dimension into the picture—interest under Sections 234A and 234B. While the extension waives 234A interest (for delayed return filing), taxpayers still remain liable under 234B if they failed to pay sufficient advance tax.“Taxpayers should note that while the tax return filing deadline is extended and hence interest under section 234A for delayed filing will not be triggered if the return is filed by September 15, interest under 234B continues till the date of actual payment if there is default in advance tax,” Raote said.She added that from a government perspective, “delayed processing means delayed scrutiny and delay in the process overall. The Government also pays interest, which starts from the date of filing of the tax return.”However, according to Abhishek Soni, CEO and Co-founder of Tax2Win, ""The extension of the ITR filing deadline from July 31 to September 15, 2025, does not increase the interest paid by the government on tax refunds. Interest continues to be calculated from April 1, 2025, up to the date the refund is issued, provided the return is filed by the extended due date. However, if the return is filed after the deadline, the interest amount may be reduced. ""While the extension provides relief to those needing more time to file, the consensus among tax professionals is clear: taxpayers should aim to file early.“While the ITR filing deadline extension provides taxpayers with additional time to file their returns, it also results in a longer waiting period for refunds. Consequently, eligible taxpayers will accrue more interest on their refunds due to the extended processing time. Taxpayers should file their returns promptly once filing is live to expedite the refund process.” said CA Shefali Mundra, Tax Expert, ClearTax.",Extended ITR deadline may lead to higher refund interest. Interest still payable if returns filed by extended deadline. How much more interest could be paid? How long will it take to process the returns? What are the implications of this for taxpayers and the exchequer?,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121480358,imgsize-566204,width-400,resizemode-4/121480358.jpg"

NEW DELHI: With the contours of the revamped PM SVANidhi scheme having been finalised, street vendors will be getting higher subsidised loans, as well as credit cards with a limit of Rs 30,000, on account of banks coming on board. The credit cards will be issued by banks to street vendors who have repaid the earlier three tranches of subsidised loans, of Rs 10,000, Rs 20,000 and Rs 50,000.TOI has learnt that the revamped scheme will soon be placed before Cabinet for approval. Sources said the subsidised loans will now also be granted to street vendors from rural areas who migrate to cities to make a living. Though the housing and urban affairs ministry did not respond to queries, sources said an additional Rs 10,000 would be provided as part of the enhanced loan amount.Sources said the credit card facility will allow street vendors with a better credit rating to have access to more rolling capital for business, with the repayment norms being decided by banks.In her Budget speech, FM Nirmala Sitharaman had said the scheme launched in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, has provided more than 68 lakh street vendors with respite from high-interest informal sector loans.

Asian stock markets slipped on Friday after a court ruling in the United States that gave president Donald Trump’s tariff policies a temporary reprieve. The stocks had improved the previous day when a lower court had termed them unconstitutional.The Nikkei in Tokyo and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 1.4% on Friday, while Shanghai’s Composite Index slipped 0.5%. Sydney and Seoul also fell, though markets in Wellington and Manila showed modest gains. The yen gained strength after inflation data from Tokyo came in higher than expected, increasing the likelihood of an interest rate hike by the central bank in July.The decline in Asian equities comes after Wall Street ended flat, with slight gains across the Dow and other main indexes. Weak US economic data, including a revised GDP contraction in early 2025 and disappointing jobless and housing numbers, added to the cautious mood.The legal tug-of-war over Trump’s tariffs is now expected to reach the Supreme Court. A federal judge had earlier ruled that the administration exceeded its authority in imposing the levies, a judgment Trump called “horrible” and urged to be overturned. ""Backroom 'hustlers' must not be allowed to destroy our nation!,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.A separate ruling by a federal district judge in Washington, DC also declared some of the tariffs unlawful, giving the administration 14 days to file an appeal.Despite the legal blocks, Trump allies insist that the administration will continue pushing its trade agenda. AFP quoted economists like Rodrigo Catril of National Australia Bank, warning that the fight only adds another layer of uncertainty. ""The only thing that looks more certain is more uncertainty, which is set to lead to a further pullback in investment decision and hiring,"" said Cartil.","The Nikkei in Tokyo and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 1.4% on Friday.

BENGALURU: The Supreme Court has admitted two appeals in the ongoing insolvency proceedings of Think & Learn, the parent entity of Byju's. The appeals were filed by the company's promoters and cricket body BCCI. The apex court has scheduled the next hearing for July 21.The cases stem from the insolvency application filed by the BCCI, which alleged unpaid dues from Byju's, a former Team India sponsor. However, both BCCI and Byju's claimed that a Rs 158-crore settlement was reached and executed before the constitution of the committee of creditors (CoC). The promoters are seeking withdrawal of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) based on this pre-CoC agreement.Senior advocate KK Venugopal, appearing for the Byju's promoters, argued that the BCCI settlement was ""fully agreed upon, paid, and formally communicated to the interim resolution professional well before the CoC was constituted."" Supporting the plea, senior counsel Guru Krishna Kumar told the court that the company's US assets are at risk, alleging that the resolution professional withdrew American legal proceedings initiated by Think & Learn against its lenders.The promoters' legal challenge comes after the NCLAT refused to allow the insolvency withdrawal, citing the formation of CoC.The dispute adds a fresh layer to the legal troubles surrounding Byju's, which has been under intense scrutiny from regulators, creditors, and investors over the past year. The July 21 hearing could determine whether Byju's can exit the insolvency process based on the timing and validity of the BCCI settlement.","The Supreme Court has admitted two appeals in the ongoing insolvency proceedings of Think & Learn, the parent entity of Byju's.

MUMBAI: The Tata Sons board has exonerated company secretary Suprakash Mukhopadhyay of any breach of the Tata code of conduct. This comes after the board, on Thursday, reviewed an internal investigation report regarding his involvement and connection with Divinion, a financial services company owned by his family.The directors reviewed and accepted the report, which concluded Mukhopadhyay did not intentionally violate the code of conduct despite failing to make necessary disclosures to the appropriate authority within Tata Sons, sources familiar with the matter said.Mukhopadhyay faced scrutiny for facilitating or seeking investments from present and past Tata employees, and external parties associated with Tata Sons. N Chandrasekaran , chairman of Tata Sons, had commissioned the report after concerns were raised about potential conflict of interest between Mukhopadhyay's connection to Divinion Advisory Services and his role within the group.""The board extensively discussed the report and ultimately gave Mukhopadhyay a clean chit,"" sources said.

MUMBAI: Coca-Cola is pivoting towards an ""all-weather"" strategy to get consumers to spend on soft drinks beyond summers - the peak sales season for beverage firms worldwide as companies increasingly contend with the scourge of climate change and vagaries of weather.""An all-weather mindset is very important. It reduces dependence on seasonality,"" said Henrique Braun, global chief operating officer and executive VP at The Coca-Cola Company. Implementing an all-weather strategy in India would mean creating more occasions to consume beverages.Coca-Cola is betting big on festivals to drive more consumption of cold beverages in India. ""India is a developing market... there are too many occasions that we need to develop in order for the seasonality to be lower. It takes time, but that's the game in the long term,"" Braun said in a media roundtable on Thursday, indicating that the early arrival of monsoons in India this year may impact summer sales. ""You might have an impact on a daily basis, weekly basis, but you need to overcome these over time, and that's what the (all-weather) strategy is,"" Braun said.The monsoon hit Kerala on May 24, eight days ahead of its normal arrival date on June 1, the earliest onset since 2009.Rains have also advanced to other parts of the country, impacting sales of soft drinks, cold beverages, and ice creams. Braun's trip to India, the second executive visit from Coca-Cola's global leadership team this year after CFO John Murphy, comes at a time when the local beverage space has become more competitive after Reliance's Campa entered the market with its cheaper-priced cola variants. ""The barrier to entry is not that big, but the barrier to stay and scale is very high,"" said Braun, who discussed growth opportunities with the India team and studied the trends shaping up in the market during his visit.Coca-Cola, which continues to see ""resilient"" demand in India despite a broader slowdown in consumption over the past few quarters, will offer a wide selection of choices to consumers and build a varied portfolio across pack sizes amid a push towards healthier options among certain sections of the population. ""More than two-thirds of our products globally have zero-calorie offerings from the same brands. There's always a product for a consumer need state in a size and serving that they want and the formulations that they can enjoy with the best taste. That's our approach. Our job is to continue to provide the right portfolio and let choice be the driver,"" Braun said.Coca-Cola said it wants to build more billion-dollar brands out of India. Over the years, it has built two homegrown brands, Maaza and Thums Up (which were acquired by the company in the 1990s), into billion-dollar brands and took them global. Sprite (not local) is the other one to have reached that mark in India.","Coca-Cola is pivoting towards an ""all-weather"" strategy to get consumers to spend on soft drinks beyond summers.

Japan, America's primary Asian ally, continues to urge Trump to withdraw tariffs on Japanese imports and eliminate the 25% duties on steel, aluminium and automobiles.The ruling caused a significant rise in the dollar against the Japanese yen, reaching 146.06 yen early Thursday, up from 144.87 yen late Wednesday.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 increased 0.3% to 8,418.90.South Korea's Kospi index climbed 1.4% to 2,707.77, benefiting from export considerations and the Bank of Korea's decision to reduce its key interest rate to 2.5% from 2.75%.US stocks declined on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 falling 0.6% to 5,888.55, remaining within 4.2% of its peak following optimism about reduced trade tensions. It had previously dropped approximately 20% below this level.The Dow industrials decreased 0.6% to 42,098.70, whilst the Nasdaq composite declined 0.5% to 19,100.94.Market activity remained subdued before Nvidia's latest quarterly earnings announcement on Wednesday after trading hours.

Abercrombie & Fitch jumped 14.7% after beating earnings and revenue forecasts. CEO Fran Horowitz credited global growth and strong performance from the Hollister brand, which helped offset weaker results from Abercrombie.Dick’s Sporting Goods rose 1.7% after surpassing analyst estimates and reaffirming its full-year outlook.The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield edged up to 4.47% from 4.43% on Tuesday.

Security benefits on the Rise

Compensation for CEOs at S&P 500 companies jumped nearly 10% in 2024, as stock prices surged and corporate profits swelled, continuing a trend of widening pay gaps between executives and average employees.According to data analyzed for The Associated Press by Equilar, the typical pay package for S&P 500 CEOs who served at least two full consecutive fiscal years rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7% from the previous year. In contrast, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419 — a 1.7% increase year over year, AP reported.The AP’s annual survey includes data from 344 executives who filed proxy statements between January 1 and April 30.Despite economic concerns such as lingering inflation and elevated interest rates, the stock market soared in 2024. The S&P 500 gained more than 23%, while corporate profits rose over 9%, driving up performance-based compensation. Many companies have shifted CEO pay toward stock-based awards, which are often conditional on future targets like share price increases or improved profitability.“2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,” said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.Rick Smith, CEO of Axon Enterprises, led the list with a $164.5 million pay package. Nearly all of it consisted of stock awards tied to future performance through 2030. Axon, the maker of Tasers and body cameras, posted a record $377 million in net income and saw its shares more than double last year.Other high earners included:Most of these packages were heavily weighted toward stock and options. According to Equilar, the median value of stock awards climbed nearly 15%, while base salaries grew by only 4%.“For CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,"" said Melissa Burek, another partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. ""Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.”Jackie Cook of Morningstar Sustainalytics noted that linking CEO pay to stock performance may reflect shareholder priorities but warned it has “led to a ‘phenomenal rise’ in CEO compensation ‘tracking recent years' market performance,’ which has ‘widened the pay gap within workplaces.’”Some well-known CEOs were excluded from the rankings due to the survey's eligibility criteria. For instance, Starbucks’ Brian Niccol, whose 2024 compensation was valued at $95.8 million, only became CEO in September. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s $49.9 million package was not included as the company filed its proxy after the survey's deadline.Warren Buffett, known for his modest salary, was listed at $405,000—about five times the median worker's pay at Berkshire Hathaway. Tesla’s Elon Musk reported no compensation for 2024, although his 2018 stock package worth up to $56 billion remains under court review.The median CEO earned 192 times what the median worker at their company made. In some industries, the disparity is even more striking. Carnival Corp. reported a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of nearly 1,300:1, and McDonald's was close behind with a 1,000:1 gap.Private-sector wages rose 3.6% in 2024, with the average U.S. worker earning $65,460 annually, or $92,000 including benefits.“With CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,” said Sarah Anderson, director of the Global Economy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies. ""These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value – they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates. ”The number of women on the list rose to 27, the highest since 2014. Their median compensation was $20 million — a 10.7% rise compared to 9.7% for male CEOs, who earned a median of $16.8 million.Top-earning female CEOs included:“There are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we’re really not moving the needle significantly,” said Christy Glass, a sociology professor at Utah State University. She cited the broader slowdown in corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts.Equilar found companies are increasingly offering security-related perks as part of executive compensation, possibly influenced by incidents such as the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.Among 208 companies reviewed, median spending on executive security rose from $69,180 in 2023 to $94,276 in 2024. Notable increases came from companies like Centene and Intel.","The median CEO earned 192 times what the median worker at their company made.

Importantly, key trade partners, including China, India, the European Union, and Japan, currently engaged in discussions with the Trump administration, face a strategic choice. They must evaluate whether to continue pursuing trade deals actively or adopt a measured approach to negotiations, given their potentially strengthened position following this development.

What the Trump administration may do

US President Donald Trump ’s reciprocal tariffs strategy to negotiate trade deals favouring America has been thrown into complete turmoil by a US trade court ruling. The US court has issued a rare rebuke to Trump, striking down tariffs that his administration sought to levy and enforce on various countries.The judicial panel, comprising three judges, determined that Trump overstepped his presidential powers in utilising the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency as justification for the broad-ranging tariffs.These tariffs represented a departure from long-standing American trade practices, causing substantial disruption to international trade flows, instability in financial markets, and increased the likelihood of inflation and economic downturn both domestically and internationally.The judicial ruling prevents the implementation of tariffs that Trump imposed in April on nearly all trading partners of the United States, along with the duties he had earlier enforced on China, Mexico and Canada.However, the court's decision maintains other Trump-era tariffs, specifically those affecting foreign steel, aluminium and automobiles. These particular duties were enacted under separate legislation that necessitated a Commerce Department investigation and could not be implemented solely based on presidential discretion.Also Read | ‘Overstepped his authority…’: What are the scathing observations made by US trade court in ruling against Donald Trump’s tariffs? The implementation timeline for the court ruling remains uncertain, with authorities having a 10-day window to execute administrative procedures for tariff removal.Upon enforcement, the ruling would swiftly eliminate the newly imposed 30% US tariffs on Chinese imports, 25% duties on Canadian and Mexican goods, and 10% levies on most other international imports entering the US.Whilst financial markets responded positively to potential tariff relief, questions remain about the lasting impact of this ruling on Trump's international trade agenda.Evaluating the ruling's effect on India-US trade deal negotiations, Ajay Srivastava, GTRI's founder, emphasised that India must stand firm against any agreements influenced by threats or founded on illegal measures.Srivastava pointed out that the tariffs implemented during Trump's presidency contravene both WTO regulations and US domestic legislation, as per the federal court's decision.""With the Trump tariffs standing on shaky legal ground, India must pause and reassess its negotiation strategy before committing to an FTA that could disproportionately favour U.S. interests,"" said Srivastava in a statement.Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said during a Thursday morning press conference in Tokyo that the administration will ""thoroughly examine the content of the ruling and its implications and respond appropriately.""Also Read | ‘Sergey Brins of the world came as students..’: Raghuram Rajan warns about risks to US economy if foreign students are curbed by Trump The Australian Trade and Tourism Minister Don Farrell indicated that his government remains committed to pursuing discussions and actively seeking the elimination of what he termed as ""unjustified"" tariffs.A Georgetown Law School professor and former WTO judge, Jennifer Hillman, questioned the logic of negotiating over tariffs that have been deemed unlawful. ""I don't know why any country would want to engage in negotiations to get out of tariffs that have now been declared illegal,"" she told Bloomberg. ""It's a very definitive decision that the reciprocal worldwide tariffs are simply illegal.""Hillman emphasised that the court's ruling specifically addressed the improper use of tariffs as a negotiating tool. ""What the court is saying is creating leverage is not a legitimate use of tariffs,"" she explained. ""To me it's a very, very important decision.""Wendy Cutler, who previously served as a US trade official and currently holds the position of vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, indicates that the court's ruling has created significant uncertainty in the president's trade strategy.She told the Associated Press that during the 90-day tariff suspension period, negotiating partners might be reluctant to offer additional concessions to the US whilst awaiting clearer legal direction.Additionally, businesses will need to review their supply chain operations, potentially accelerating their US-bound deliveries to mitigate possible risks should the tariffs be restored following an appeal.Also Read | Remittances tax: How Donald Trump's 'The One Big Beautiful Bill’ may turn out to be ugly for Indians in the US The court's decision highlighted that Trump maintains authority under the Trade Act of 1974 to implement tariffs for addressing trade imbalances. However, this legislation limits tariff rates to 15% and allows implementation for only 150 days with nations where the US experiences significant trade deficits.Legal specialists, including Hillman, acknowledge that Trump maintains access to alternative legal mechanisms. However, none of these options provide the extensive authority available under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) that Trump previously utilised.Critics have pointed out the administration's previous resistance to judicial decisions, and Trump's supporters have questioned judicial impartiality, raising concerns about compliance with this latest court order.Trump retains the ability to implement sector-specific or country-targeted tariffs, similar to his previous term's actions. Recently, he utilised national security provisions to enforce duties on foreign steel, aluminium and automobiles, whilst initiating seven additional investigations covering pharmaceuticals, lumber, critical minerals and other sectors.""The Trump administration's toolbox won't be completely empty,"" Dmitry Grozoubinski, director of ExplainTrade and author of the book ""Why Politicians Lie About Trade"" said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. But as for IEEPA, ""if they comply with this ruling that takes that toy out of the toy box.""A spokesperson from the White House has rejected the court ruling, stating it was made by 'unelected judges' who shouldn't possess authority 'to decide how to properly address a national emergency'.""Foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment of the United States has fueled America's historic and persistent trade deficits,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. ""These deficits have created a national emergency that has decimated American communities, left our workers behind, and weakened our defense industrial base – facts that the court did not dispute.""Also Read | Big export boom: India benefits from Donald Trump’s tariffs; Indian firms see competitive position in the US tariff scenario","US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs strategy to negotiate trade deals favouring America has been thrown into complete turmoil by a US trade court ruling.

The Commerce Department released the revised estimate Thursday, slightly improving on its initial figure.The drop in gross domestic product (GDP) — the broadest measure of economic output — follows a 2.4% gain in the fourth quarter of 2024. The contraction was primarily driven by a sharp increase in imports as companies rushed to stockpile foreign goods ahead of Trump’s sweeping tariff hikes, AP reported.“First-quarter growth was brought down by a surge in imports as companies in the United States hurried to bring in foreign goods before the president imposed massive import taxes,” the report said.Imports surged at a 42.6% pace, the fastest since the third quarter of 2020, subtracting more than five percentage points from GDP growth. At the same time, consumer spending slowed considerably, while federal government spending fell at a 4.6% annual rate — the steepest decline in three years.Although trade deficits mathematically subtract from GDP, the effect is largely accounting-based. GDP only includes domestic production, so imports — even if counted as consumer spending — must be excluded to avoid overstating domestic economic activity.The import spike is seen as temporary and may not weigh on GDP in the April–June quarter.Despite the headline contraction, business investment surged 24.4% during the quarter. A buildup in inventories, as firms stocked up in anticipation of tariffs, contributed more than 2.6 percentage points to GDP.A measure of core economic strength — which excludes trade, inventories, and government spending — rose at a solid 2.5% annual rate in Q1, down slightly from 2.9% in the previous quarter.Trump’s broad tariff regime has created added uncertainty for the economic outlook. He has imposed 10% levies on nearly all US trade partners, in addition to targeted tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles.On Wednesday, a US federal court blocked the 10% tariffs along with duties on specific imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, ruling that the president had exceeded his legal authority.Thursday’s release was the second of three estimates of first-quarter GDP.

The White House immediately appealed the decision, and it remains unclear whether the administration will comply during the legal process.“The ruling was, at the least, ‘a brief respite before the next thunderclap,’” said Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management. “Just when traders thought they’d seen every twist in the tariff saga, the gavel dropped like a lightning bolt over the Pacific.”Despite the uncertainty over future appeals, investors were encouraged by the prospect of easing trade tensions.

Markets Cheer As Federal Court Strikes Down Trump’s Global Tariffs In Unanimous Ruling

US President Donald Trump’s tariffs being struck down by a US trade court should make India tread with caution on a potential trade deal, says the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). The GTRI has advised India to exercise prudence in its current Free Trade Agreement (FTA) discussions with the United States.On May 28, a federal court in Manhattan deemed invalid Trump's initiative to levy reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners, establishing that such tariff impositions require Congressional approval rather than presidential emergency powers.The court's verdict explicitly stated that tariffs, including those enacted under emergency economic authority, were not legally valid.According to an ANI report, GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava, whilst evaluating the ruling's implications on trade discussions, has emphasised that India should not accept any arrangements influenced by threats or founded on illegal measures.Also Read | ‘Overstepped his authority…’: What are the scathing observations made by US trade court in ruling against Donald Trump’s tariffs? Srivastava noted that the tariffs from Trump's administration contravene both World Trade Organisation (WTO) regulations and US domestic legislation, as confirmed by the federal court ruling.""With the Trump tariffs standing on shaky legal ground, India must pause and reassess its negotiation strategy before committing to an FTA that could disproportionately favour U.S. interests,"" said Srivastava in a statement.India and the United States are set to finalise the initial phase of the anticipated Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) prior to July.The trade agreement between India and the US would represent a crucial development in the economic partnership between these major economies, creating potential opportunities for trade and investment collaboration.The United States maintained its position as India's primary trading partner for the fourth successive year in 2024-25, with trade between the nations reaching USD 131.84 billion. During this period, India recorded a goods trade surplus of USD 41.18 billion with the US.Following the US federal court's significant decision, global stock markets responded favourably, particularly in prominent Asian markets. Japan's Nikkei and Korea's Kospi indices recorded increases of two per cent post-ruling.Also Read | ‘It can either be big or beautiful, not both…’: Elon Musk disappointed by Donald Trump's ‘Big beautiful bill'; sign of fracture in key relationship?","The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has advised India to exercise prudence in its current Free Trade Agreement (FTA) discussions with the United States.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-104762027,imgsize-23138,width-400,resizemode-4/104762027.jpg"

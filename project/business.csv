The U.S. has announced a 90-day temporary pause on the imposition of the higher reciprocal tariffs on its trading partners. In a notable policy shift, the announcement came just hours after higher reciprocal tariffs had taken effect. While the temporary pause signals a potential softening of the tariff approach amid ongoing negotiations, the universal 10% base tariff on all imports will remain in place during this period. At the same time, the U.S increased tariffs on goods from China to 125%, citing China’s ""lack of respect"" after the country retaliated by announcing an 84% on U.S. imports.The U.S. reciprocal tariffs on China are set to cause major disruptions to global supply chains, forcing American companies to explore alternative suppliers. This creates a significant opportunity for India to step up as a key trading partner, especially as trade conflicts with China continue. As global businesses look to further diversify their supply chains away from China, India has the chance to strategically position itself as a viable alternative, capitalizing on this shift to boost exports, attract investments, and enhance its manufacturing capabilities.Electronics is one of the key sectors for India to gain with India's exports valued at nearly USD 14 Bn.Electronics play a critical role in global trade, with countries like China dominating the exports landscape (i.e., with a market share of >30%). Though India’s export market share is in low single digits and steadily growing, the US's 125% tariff on Chinese electronics imports, including smartphones, laptops, and other electronic devices, makes Indian manufactured products more competitive in the American market. Global brands such as Apple, which already use India as a key export hub, would likely increase production in the country to avoid higher costs associated with Chinese imports. This could lead to a surge in Indian exports of finished electronic devices and even components like batteries, circuit boards, and displays.The additional demand for non-Chinese suppliers, also presents a unique opportunity for Indian Electronics manufacturers to expand and scale up operations and capture a larger share of the global market. India’s strategic initiatives such as the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes for smartphones, IT hardware, telecom products, and the newly introduced PLI for electronics component manufacturing, can collectively enhance India’s competitiveness by lowering cost barriers for exports.As a strategic move, the Trump administration continued the exclusion of semiconductors from reciprocal tariffs, acknowledging their irreplaceable role. Semiconductors being crucial for national security and technological advancement, disrupting their supply could have led to significant implications.The U.S. is actively promoting domestic semiconductor manufacturing through the U.S. CHIPS Act, which allocates $52 Bn for local semiconductor production. With significant investments already being made in new facilities and technologies by large chip makers of world like Intel & TSMC, exempting reciprocal tariffs supports this domestic growth strategy. Further, the current global semiconductor supply chain is deeply entrenched and complex, with maximum production already taking place in Taiwan & South Korea, disrupting this network would be challenging and relocating the existing capacity would take decades and investment of very large scale.It is expected that the current pause offers a window for diplomatic engagement for initiating negotiations for trade agreements with the U.S. The pause in reciprocal tariffs aligns with India’s broader efforts to enhance US-India trade relations as both nations actively work towards a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) aimed at doubling bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. To maintain a strong position in global trade and further strengthen its role as an alternative global manufacturing hub, India can look to deepen economic cooperation with the US, forging strategic partnerships and collaborations with U.S. that promote mutual benefits, minimize reciprocal tariff and drive sustained long-term export growth.While the coming months will shape the future of global trade dynamics, the temporary suspension of US reciprocal tariffs provides India a unique window to enhance its bilateral relations. By addressing existing challenges, improving market access to the US, and leveraging strategic initiatives like ""Make in India,"" India can position itself as a reliable global supplier and accelerate its economic growth trajectory.","The U.S. has announced a 90-day temporary pause on the imposition of the higher reciprocal tariffs on its trading partners.

Index View: NiftyAfter completing its 24k target and reclaiming above the 200 DMA, this is the third consecutive day wherein the index has closed above the same after a 10% flash rally. Given the geopolitical developments and a stretched rally looking tired on charts, we shift our stance to sideways from buy on dip with a short term support seen at 23900 below which weakening momentum could pick up. Despite a strong handover from the global front this morning, charts do not warrant an immediate upside after a flash rally seen in the past 10 trading days.Bank NiftyBank Nifty continued to lead the charge amongst the widely tracked indices with staging a 1800 odd point rally for this week at yesterday’s high. An additional 2000 points target had opened up on charts after its strong closing on Thursday. Yesterday was the first instance since the panic lows of 7th April that Bank Nifty underperformed Nifty marking an end to its upper hand in this leg.Any closing below 55240 is likely to drag the index on a negative momentum from here on. We shall further the case after Bank Nifty’s reaction near the 56200 levels, as it looks extremely overbought daily and hourly charts. Ambuja Cements stock has found strong support from its 5 year trendline earlier this month and this is its 6th touch base on this trendline in the past 5 years , making it all the more stronger. In the short term the 200 DMA has also been reclaimed along with the index as this helps in establishing its short term trend northwards.QSR stocks had been sliding since the start of this calendar year. Marking an end to the slide, Jubilant FoodWorks has given a breakout of a 3 month long correction while making a higher bottom formation all through the past 4 weeks. A quick 6-8% upside follows through this breakout on the stock.SBI Cards and Payment Services stock has closed at a fresh 22 month high with repeated lower high formation suggesting accumulation on every dips being observed. The scrip has held its neck above its 200 DMA as well as 200 WMA for the past 8-10 weeks now suggesting that its short term as well as medium term trend has now been established northwards and dips are likely to get bought into.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Ambuja Cements, Jubilant FoodWorks and SBI Cards and Payment Services are the top buy calls for today.

The shift offered investors much-needed relief, with market sentiment buoyed by Trump’s decision not to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell and speculation that trade tariffs on Chinese goods could be reduced.The greenback had been under pressure, lingering near three-year lows amid uncertainty over Trump’s tariff policies and repeated criticism of the Federal Reserve. However, comments from both Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested a possible thaw in US-China relations and signalled a willingness to engage in deeper economic collaboration.Trump, speaking from the Oval Office, said: “I have no intention of firing him,” referring to Powell. “I would like to see him be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates.” The remark came after days of speculation over the Fed's independence, which had rattled investors and triggered volatility in global markets.The dollar index rose 0.297% to 99.86 in early Asian trading, before stabilising as cautious optimism returned. The euro slipped 0.86% to $1.132, reversing gains made earlier in the week.Helen Given of Monex USA said the renewed dialogue with China was a key factor: “People are very relieved that there's potential for discussions between the two countries.”Bessent reinforced that message in Washington, suggesting any easing of tariffs would not be unilateral and would depend on progress in talks with Beijing. He also voiced strong criticism of the IMF and World Bank but affirmed US support for their roles, distancing the Trump administration from earlier proposals advocating a US withdrawal.Meanwhile, Trump hinted at further tariffs if no deals were made. “If we don’t have a deal... we’re going to set the tariff,” he said. He also suggested auto tariffs on Canada could increase, despite existing exemptions under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement.The markets responded positively. Dow futures jumped 1.9%, S&P 500 rose 2.6%, and Nasdaq gained 3% before the opening bell. Tech stocks surged, with Tesla up 7% after Elon Musk pledged to focus more on the company and less on Washington politics. Apple and Meta also rose sharply despite EU fines.","Dollar index rose 0.297% to 99.86 in early Asian trading. Euro slipped 0.86% to $1.132, reversing gains made earlier in the week.

Businessmen and professionals often under-report their income to avoid paying taxes, prompting tax authorities to widen the ambit of TCS and tax deducted at source.Based on the data received by the department, tax returns are matched with the purchases made, and often taxpayers are nudged to cough up the right amount of tax with a provision allowing them to update their returns.

RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra views current economic conditions as conducive to easing, minutes of the central bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting held on April 9, which were released on Wednesday, showed. With inflation hovering near the 4% target and growth still moderate, Malhotra argued that monetary policy should now focus on strengthening domestic demand to sustain and accelerate momentum.The MPC voted unanimously to lower the policy rate by 25 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) and shift its stance to accommodative, reinforcing the central bank's growing confidence in inflation containment.""Coming to the imposition of tariffs, in my view, the implications for inflation are two-sided. On the upside, uncertainties may lead to possible currency pressures resulting in imported inflation. On the downside, a slowdown in global growth will further soften commodity and crude oil prices, which would ease the pressure on inflation,"" said Malhotra. His comments point to a balancing act between external risks and domestic priorities, with the latter increasingly taking centre stage.Voting for a cut in interest rates, Malhotra said, ""Going forward too, considering the evolving growth-inflation trajectories, monetary policy needs to be accommodative.""A research note from Barclays described the minutes as 'dovish', pointing to RBI's continued liquidity operations since the April 9 meeting. These include bond purchases worth Rs 40,000 crore and long-dated variable rate repo operations totalling Rs 1.5 lakh crore. Amendments to the liquidity coverage ratio framework, effective from April 2026, are also expected to release Rs 1 lakh crore of loanable funds into the banking system.Among MPC members, Nagesh Kumar stressed the need to stimulate private consumption and investment through both fiscal and monetary tools, particularly in an environment of persistent global uncertainty. He flagged a downgraded growth outlook for 2025-26 and warned that turbulence in global markets could dampen foreign direct investment and private capex. The recent decline in inflation, he argued, provides room for a more accommodative stance.Saugata Bhattacharya acknowledged the risks posed by global trade disruptions and underscored the importance of supporting growth in the face of possible external shocks. He noted that unless trade tariffs are scaled back, both global trade and India's growth may weaken. However, he stopped short of recommending aggressive policy measures, citing the underlying resilience of domestic economic activity.

This indicates that the virus is in circulation, reaching an endemic stage. The number of fever cases in the city has decreased drastically in April compared to March.""We had one of the longest flu seasons in 2024.

IMF warns of 'intensified' risks to public finances amid US trade war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/imf-warns-of-intensified-risks-to-public-finances-amid-us-trade-war/articleshow/120560050.cms,"'Heightened uncertainty'

Different paths

Donald Trump's tariff plans have increased the risks to public finances, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday, warning countries to get their spending plans under control and prepare for ""sharper"" trade-offs.The US president's on-again, off-again introduction of levies against top trading partners has sent market volatility soaring and unnerved investors, who are attempting to chart a path through the increased uncertainty.Over the past six months, ""global economic prospects have significantly deteriorated, and risks to the economic output are elevated and tilted to the downside"" Vitor Gaspar, the head of the IMF's Fiscal Affairs department, told reporters on Wednesday at the launch of the Fund's Fiscal Monitor report.The forecast for public finances was published as part of the Fund and the World Bank's Spring Meetings of global financial leaders currently under way in Washington.Under its new projections, which incorporate some -- but not all -- of the recently announced tariffs, the IMF now expects global general government debt to rise to more than 95 percent of economic output this year, and to approach 100 percent of GDP by 2030.In the forecasts, the IMF expects public debt to rise by about the same amount as the combined increases seen in 2023 and 2024, Gaspar told AFP in an interview ahead of the report's publication.""There is a pronounced trend in public debt around the world,"" he said.The IMF warned in its report that the ""heightened uncertainty"" about tariffs and economic policy, combined with rising bond yields in major economies, widening spreads in emerging markets, foreign aid cuts, and increased defense spending in Europe had all complicated the global debt outlook.""Fiscal policy now faces a sharper trade-off between reducing debt, building buffers against uncertainties and accommodating spending pressures, all amidst weaker growth prospects, higher financing costs, and heightened risks,"" it added.While public spending levels may pose political challenges, the right policy can also ""be a source of confidence and support in potentially very demanding macroeconomic circumstances,"" Gaspar told AFP.""Communities may be severely affected by trade dislocations, and targeted and temporary support... could be a way forward,"" he added.The IMF expects that more than a third of the world's economies, who collectively account for 75 percent of global GDP, will see a rise in indebtedness this year.This includes many of the world's largest economies, including the United States, China, Germany, Britain, and France.But these countries will face very different realities when it comes to handling that debt, Gaspar said in the interview.""Both China and the United States are continental economies,"" he said. ""They have a space that other economies don't have.""""The United States has an ample set of options, both on the revenue side and on the spending side, that it can deploy to control the deficit, stabilize the level of public debt and decrease the level of public debt, if it chooses to do so,"" he added.""How it's going to happen depends on... the choices made in the context of the US political system,"" he said.For China, Gaspar noted that the authorities would ""eventually"" need to tackle its public debt, but should focus their attention at this moment in time on providing targeted support to transform the economy.""Fiscal support in China is welcome right now,"" he said. ""It is something that helps rebalancing China growth towards the domestic economy.""""By doing so, it helps reduce the external imbalance.""","IMF warns of ""sharper"" trade-off between reducing debt, building buffers against uncertainties.

Boeing CEO confirms China 'stopped taking delivery' amid Beijing-Washington tariff row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-ceo-confirms-china-stopped-taking-delivery-amid-beijing-washington-tariff-row/articleshow/120556393.cms,"Boeing CEO: We're on target for positive free cash flow in second half of year

Boeing on Wednesday said that China has ""stopped taking delivery"" of its aircraft, as tensions between Washington and Beijing over tariffs continue to disrupt the global aviation market.The company will now begin marketing the planes to other airlines after Chinese carriers returned the planes, Aerospace giant CEO Kelly Ortberg said in an interview with CNBC.Boeing would be “pretty pragmatic” in finding alternative buyers for the aircrafts, he added.The remarks came after reports of multiple Boeing 737 MAX jets , originally bound for Chinese airlines, were flown back to the United States. One such aircraft, destined for Xiamen Airlines, made an unplanned return to Boeing Field in Seattle on Sunday.The shift came after US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145% earlier this month to which the latter retaliated with its own 125% tariffs on US-made goods, including aircrafts. The decision rendered Boeing’s bestselling 737 MAX, with a market value of around $55 million, far less affordable for Chinese airlines.The financial pressure reportedly pushed Beijing to consider measures to help its domestic carriers, especially those leasing Boeing jets.The company reported a narrower-than-expected loss of $123 million for the first quarter, with revenues rising 18% to $19.5 billion.In an earnings statement, Ortberg said the numbers show the company is “moving in the right direction.”Boeing also reaffirmed plans to boost aircraft production, stating it will raise monthly output of the 737 MAX to 38 by 2025, and increase 787 Dreamliner production from five to seven per month.","Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg says China has ""stopped taking delivery"" of its aircraft.

Trump’s tariff tumble: The twist in US-China trade war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-tariff-war-on-china-xi-jinping-us-china-trade-war/articleshow/120556560.cms,"Beijing isn’t biting

For now, Beijing appears in no rush to respond. And that, experts say, is precisely the point.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has maintained radio silence even as Trump continues to dangle public invitations for dialogue. The response from Beijing has been calculated - and increasingly cold.

has maintained radio silence even as Trump continues to dangle public invitations for dialogue. The response from Beijing has been calculated - and increasingly cold. According to the Kobeissi Letter, state-backed Chinese funds have begun pulling back from US private equity investments under pressure from the government. Major players like the China Investment Corporation have halted planned commitments, and Chinese investors are avoiding US-linked deals, even when managed offshore.

The message: China is not only refusing to blink — it’s preparing to go without.

This week, China’s commerce ministry issued a blunt warning: it “firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests.” It’s a posture steeped in nationalism and, increasingly, leverage.

‘We have an embargo now’

'The more he talks, the more anxious he looks'

A self-inflicted wound?

If Trump’s goal was to pressure Beijing into concessions, analysts argue he may have misjudged the moment - and his opponent.

The 145% tariffs have hurt Chinese exporters, but they’ve also fueled inflation in the US, raised costs for American businesses, and alienated allies. China, by contrast, appears increasingly insulated. Years of preparation — diversifying trade routes, investing in domestic supply chains, and cultivating new markets in Asia, Africa, and Europe — have paid off.

Beijing has been methodical, and perhaps more importantly, patient.

US-China relations are in ""effectively a state of economic war,"" Susan Thornton, who served as acting top US diplomat for East Asia during Trump's first administration, told AFP.

""China views Trump's stated intent to... erect a 'tariff wall against China' as illegal and an existential threat,"" Thornton, now a senior fellow at Yale's Paul Tsai China Center, said.

Meanwhile, Washington is bleeding goodwill - and time.

No deal, no summit

By all appearances, Donald Trump is looking for a way out. Just months into his second presidency, the US President is signaling a retreat - or at least a recalibration - on one of his most aggressive economic fronts: the trade war with China.At a White House press conference on Tuesday, Trump appeared to temper his earlier hardline stance on tariffs, saying duties on Chinese imports “will come down substantially” but “won’t be zero.” His tone was markedly less confrontational: “We’re going to be very nice and they’re going to be very nice,” he said, striking an oddly conciliatory note for a man who just weeks ago called Chinese trade practices “cheating at a planetary scale. ”To some, this sounded like strategy. But to many experts and investors, it sounded more like anxiety.“Trump is panicking due to the markets plummeting and still very high US treasury yields,” said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, in comments to the South China Morning Post. “He needs a deal - and quick. China does not need to offer anything big in such circumstances.”Despite the White House’s optimistic language, the broader reality is grim.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent privately admitted in a closed-door investor summit that the current status quo - 145% tariffs by the US and 125% retaliatory duties from China — amounts to “a two-way embargo.” Though he predicted “de-escalation” in the near future, he conceded that formal negotiations haven’t even begun.“No one thinks the current situation is sustainable,” Bessent said. But he also acknowledged the absence of a road map.Markets responded favorably - temporarily. The S&P 500 rose 2.5% on the day, buoyed by hopes that Washington might finally relent. But the deeper concern is structural: the tariffs have roiled financial markets, triggered selloffs in US Treasuries, and spooked investors who once viewed the dollar as a safe haven.As the New York Times noted, Trump's personalized approach - ratcheting up pressure to force a top-level summit - has so far failed. Xi Jinping, it seems, won’t be strong-armed into a phone call, the NYT said.Trump’s own remarks may be undercutting his leverage. “In reality, there hasn’t been any substantial progress or change in the US-China tariff negotiations,” said Chen Zhiwu, a professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong. “This is [Trump’s] way of signaling to China.”“But the more he talks like this, the more it shows how anxious the US side is,” Chen told the SCMP. “Trump and his team are under pressure, but China isn’t showing any signs of impatience.”Others agree that Trump’s apparent softening is likely a reflection of pressure at home — not progress abroad.“Rising living costs, economic disarray, and popular discontent will eventually force a definite pivot,” said Xu Tianchen of the Economist Intelligence Unit. For now, he said, Trump’s tariff comments appear more like improvisation than strategy. “Things are still pretty fluid.”Even the possibility of a Trump-Xi summit now seems remote. “Trump has torched any realistic chance of a near-term meeting,” said Wu Xinbo of Fudan University. “His behavior is seen as rude and unreasonable — there’s no trust.”Others echo that view. “Neither Trump nor Xi will want to convey that he has yielded to the other,” Ali Wyne of the International Crisis Group told AFP. “They both want to look strong. But Xi has the advantage of time.”For Beijing, a deal now - under economic duress and political chaos in Washington - would look like capitulation. That is politically untenable for Xi, who has spent years cultivating an image of strength and resolve.(With inputs from agencies)","Beijing has been methodical, and perhaps more importantly, patient.

US stocks kicked off Wednesday’s trading session with a powerful rally, fuelled by renewed investor optimism after key political developments helped ease recent market tensions. Following weeks of volatility driven by concerns over interest rates, central bank independence, and global trade, Wall Street welcomed signs of stability from Washington.Markets surged after President Donald Trump backed off threats to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and suggested a potential thaw in the trade standoff with China. Trump’s more measured comments came as a relief to investors worried about policy uncertainty and its potential impact on the broader economy.By 9:49 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had surged 1,048.76 points, or 2.68%, to 40,235.74. The Nasdaq Composite soared 675.65 points, or 4.14%, to 16,976.07, leading the charge thanks to strong rebounds in major technology names. The S&P 500 followed suit, up 172.46 points, or 3.26%, to 5,460.22.The continued rally came amid growing optimism that recent tensions between the White House and the Federal Reserve may ease, and that trade talks with China could resume with less friction.Tech stocks, in particular, appeared to benefit from a combination of regulatory clarity and investor rotation back into growth assets.Risk appetite surged while safe-haven assets declined. Gold dropped sharply by 3.51% to $3,299.50 per ounce, reflecting a shift in investor sentiment. Oil held mostly steady, down just 0.11% at $63.60 a barrel.In bond markets, the yield on the US 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.311%, down 7.8 basis points, suggesting continued demand for fixed-income assets even amid the stock market rally The VIX, a key gauge of market volatility, dropped 9.06% to 27.80, indicating that investor anxiety was easing significantly as equities climbed. Meanwhile, the euro slipped slightly against the US dollar, with the EUR/USD pair down 0.152% to 1.136.ALSO READ | Global markets surge as Trump eases Fed, China trade concerns Meanwhile, Global markets including US markets future opened with strong gains Wednesday after President Donald Trump said he had no plans to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, easing concerns over political interference in the central bank.Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average had jumped 1.9% ahead of the open, while S&P 500 futures rose 2.6% and Nasdaq futures climbed 3%.Trump, frustrated that the Fed was not cutting interest rates aggressively enough, previously suggested he could remove Powell. But on Tuesday, he told reporters, “I had no intention of firing him.”The president had been pressuring the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate to help boost economic growth. However, Powell and other central bank officials signaled a more cautious stance, citing economic uncertainty driven in part by Trump’s own tariffs and persistent inflation above the Fed’s 2% target.Most legal scholars agreed that Trump could not remove Powell from the Fed’s board of governors, and there was no legal precedent for firing a Fed chair. The legality of removing him as chair specifically remained murky.Markets also reacted positively to comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said the ongoing trade war with China was “unsustainable” and predicted a “de-escalation” in tensions. His remarks added to hopes of a more stable trade environment.“Markets clearly followed every shift in tone from the White House on trade policy,” said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade. “Investors saw these developments as a sign of reduced risk in the near term.”Despite the day’s rally, analysts cautioned that markets would likely remain volatile, swinging with investor sentiment around potential trade deals and the possibility of further economic slowdown.Tesla shares rebounded sharply, rising 7% in early trading after CEO Elon Musk promised to spend less time in Washington and more time focused on the company. The announcement came shortly after Tesla reported a steep drop in quarterly profits—from $1.39 billion to $409 million—amid a wave of protests, vandalism, and boycotts tied to Musk’s cost-cutting work with the US government.Technology stocks also rallied. Nvidia jumped 5.5%, while Apple and Meta rose 3% and 4.5%, respectively. The gains came despite hefty EU fines—€500 million for Apple and €200 million for Meta—for breaching digital competition laws.Markets overseas shared in the optimism. In Europe, France’s CAC 40 rose 2.4%, Germany’s DAX climbed 2.6%, and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 added 1.4%. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 finished 1.9% higher, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong jumped 2.4%, although China’s Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1%.Energy prices ticked up, with US crude rising 55 cents to $64.22 a barrel. Despite the uptick, oil was still on track for its worst monthly performance since October 2023.

Global stock markets rallied Wednesday after US President Donald Trump moved to reassure investors by confirming he has “no intention” of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell , while also indicating a possible reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods Markets, already shaken by an ongoing trade war, had been further rattled earlier in the week when Trump lashed out at Powell, calling him a “major loser” and “Mr. Too Late” for not cutting interest rates. Reports that Trump was considering removing the Fed chief raised fears over the central bank’s independence and the broader economic outlook, according to news agency AFP.However, the president sought to calm nerves Tuesday, telling reporters, “I have no intention of firing him.” The statement helped steady sentiment, with analysts suggesting the worst of recent market turbulence may be behind us.“These comments have given markets a sense of optimism that recent chaos might have peaked and we’re heading towards calmer waters,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.European stocks responded strongly: Frankfurt’s DAX jumped 2.5%, Paris’ CAC 40 rose 2.1%, and London’s FTSE 100 gained 1.3%.In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index soared 2.4% on a tech rally led by Alibaba and Tencent, while Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 climbed 1.9%.

Shanghai, however, dipped slightly, down 0.1%.Wall Street also enjoyed strong gains overnight, with all three major US indices rising more than 2%.Trump’s remarks extended to trade, hinting at a possible shift in stance. The US currently imposes tariffs of up to 145% on various Chinese imports, with Beijing responding with 125% duties.

China on Wednesday signaled a renewed willingness to engage in trade negotiations with the United States, declaring that ""the door for talks is wide open"" amid ongoing tariff tensions.The statement follows recent comments by US President Donald Trump , who hinted that the sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports—some as high as 145 percent—could be significantly reduced once a trade agreement is in place. The tariffs, introduced during Trump’s second term, have escalated a long-running trade war between the two global powers.Speaking at a regular press briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun reiterated Beijing’s preference for dialogue over confrontation. “We do not wish to fight, nor are we afraid of fighting,” he said. “If necessary, we will fight to the end. But the door for talks is wide open.”Also read: Tariffs 'hurt multilateral trade and world economic order,' says China Guo also issued a subtle warning to Washington, cautioning that expressing an interest in negotiation while simultaneously exerting maximum pressure would be counterproductive. “One cannot seek cooperation while resorting to coercion,” he noted.The remarks come as markets remain on edge amid fears that continued economic hostilities between the US and China could deepen global financial instability.Despite this, Beijing’s message appears to underscore a strategic openness to de-escalation—on its own terms.China's statements comes while Trump earlier revealed his intentions to lower tariffs on China. Speaking from the Oval Office on Tuesday, he told reporters the 145 per cent tariff rate would “come down substantially.” He said, ""145 per cent is very high, and it won't be that high. No, it won't be anywhere near that high. It'll come down substantially. But it won't be zero ‒ used to be zero. We were just destroyed. China was taking us for a ride. "" He added, “We’re going to be very nice, they’re going to be very nice, and we’ll see what happens. But ultimately, they have to make a deal because otherwise they’re not going to be able to deal in the United States.”Trump’s softer tone followed a warning from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who reportedly told investors at a JP Morgan forum that the trade standoff is “untenable” and “no one thinks the current status quo is sustainable.”The trade conflict has resulted in US tariffs of 145 per cent on Chinese imports, with China responding with 125 per cent duties on US goods. Some items, like smartphones and semiconductors, are exempt, but a 20% blanket tariff linked to fentanyl concerns remains.While formal talks haven’t started, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said over 100 countries are interested in new trade deals after Trump’s global tariff announcement—though China isn't one of them yet. She insisted the administration is “setting the stage” for a future deal and is “doing very well” on trade.Markets responded positively, with US stock indexes rising over 2% after Bessent’s remarks, suggesting investors are hopeful about easing tensions.Also read: End to US-China trade war?

Financial educator and best-selling author Robert Kiyosaki has made a bold projection for Bitcoin value as investors deal with the current global economic turmoil. According to the Rich Dad Poor Dad author, Bitcoin could surpass $1 million per coin by 2035, with gold hitting $30,000 per ounce and silver reaching $3,000 per coin.In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Kiyosaki emphasized that even those struggling financially today still have a chance to become wealthy - if they take decisive action now. “If a poor person bought a few ounces of gold or silver, or 1/2 of a Bitcoin,” he wrote, “I predict they may become the new rich… once this Depression is over.”""I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be over $1 million dollars. Gold will be $30k and silver $3,000 a coin,"" he further asserted.His statement comes amid growing fears of a deepening financial downturn. With US credit card and national debt at historic highs, unemployment rising, and retirement accounts shrinking, many Americans are feeling the pressure. But Kiyosaki believes this crisis — which he refers to as the ""Greater Depression"" - ""may be the opportunity of your lifetime"".“This may be the easiest money you ever make. Those who wait in fear….may be the biggest losers” Kiyosaki further stated, pointing to alternative assets like Bitcoin and precious metals as potential lifelines for those willing to step outside traditional systems.Kiyosaki also highlighted the significance of mental attitude alongside financial guidance in building wealth. Based on his life experiences and personal history, he observed that an individual's approach to discussing money significantly influences their financial future.""Poor people are poor because they speak and think poor words—like 'I can't afford it' or 'I'll wait.' Words become flesh,"" he said. Simply said “poor people speak poorly about themselves,"" he added.","Financial educator and best-selling author Robert Kiyosaki has made a bold projection for Bitcoin value as investors deal with the current global economic turmoil.

Asian markets rose on Wednesday, encouraged by US President Donald Trump's reassurance that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will remain in his position.The Indian equity benchmarks opened on a positive note on Wednesday, with the BSE Sensex crossing 80,200 and trading at 80,140.02, up 544 points or 0.68 percent, as of 9.21 AM. The Nifty50 also advanced, reaching 24,326.10, up 159 points or 0.66 percent. The rally was supported by continued foreign institutional investor (FII) buying, with net purchases worth Rs 1,290 crore on Tuesday. Positive sentiment was also driven by accommodative measures from the Reserve Bank of India and optimism over potential India-US trade agreements. Global cues were favorable after US President Donald Trump reassured markets by expressing support for the Federal Reserve Chair and indicating a possible easing in US-China trade tensions . Despite global uncertainty and regional instability, Indian markets remained resilient. Experts suggest staying invested in high-quality large-cap stocks while remaining cautious of potential profit booking as markets approach overbought levels.The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo climbed 1.7 percent to 34,797.22, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 advanced 1.6 percent to 7,943.00. South Korea’s Kospi added 1.2 percent to 2,515.19, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.7 percent to 21,927.92.The Shanghai Composite remained largely unchanged at 3,298.33.Trump addressed speculation about Powell’s job security on Tuesday, stating, ""I have no intention of firing him."" Investor confidence also got a boost from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who indicated that the current trade tensions with China are unsustainable and signaled possible relief from tariffs.US stock markets rebounded sharply on Tuesday. The S&P 500 rose 2.5 percent to 5,287.76, the Dow Jones surged 1,106.57 points to 39,186.98, and the Nasdaq gained 2.7 percent to close at 16,300.42. Analysts cautioned that volatility may persist, depending on the outcome of ongoing trade negotiations. The IMF, meanwhile, downgraded its global growth forecast from 3.3 percent to 2.8 percent, citing trade uncertainties.Positive corporate earnings reports helped support Wall Street’s rally. Elon Musk’s announcement of renewed focus on Tesla operations lifted investor mood, even as the company continues to face protests, vandalism, and boycotts due to Musk's role in advising government spending cuts. Tesla’s after-hours earnings showed a drop in profits to 409 million dollars from 1.39 billion, falling short of analyst expectations.Earlier, Trump had also signaled de-escalation in the ongoing trade war with China claiming that he'll lower tariffs ""significantly"".""145% is very high, and it won't be that high,"" Trump said.

Donald Trump vs Jerome Powell: Can US President really oust the US Federal Reserve chairman?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-vs-jerome-powell-can-us-president-really-oust-the-us-federal-reserve-chairman/articleshow/120524145.cms,"AI generated image

What if Trump tries anyway?

US President Donald Trump fired a fresh salvo against Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, escalating attacks for resisting further interest rate cuts. The clash is rattling financial markets, raising a critical question: Can Trump actually fire Powell?The answer is murky—and the implications could be huge.Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, members of the Fed's Board of Governors are appointed to 14-year terms and can only be removed ""for cause,"" widely interpreted to mean serious misconduct—not policy disagreements. However, the law is less clear when it comes to the Fed chair’s four-year leadership term, which lacks explicit removal restrictions.According to Reuters, no US president has ever tried to oust a Fed chair, making any such move legally uncharted territory. Several unrelated legal cases involving Trump’s past efforts to remove leaders of independent agencies are now making their way through the courts—and could serve as precedent if Trump tries to push Powell out.In theory, Trump could attempt to remove Powell solely as chair while allowing him to remain a governor until his term ends in 2028. That would still leave Trump the opportunity to elevate another governor—potentially someone more aligned with his policy views—to the chair position.However, Fed independence is deeply valued, even among Trump’s own appointees, such as Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. That complicates any assumption that a leadership shakeup would lead directly to rate cuts.Trump has no direct control over the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the panel that sets interest rates. By custom, the FOMC picks the Fed chair as its own leader, but it could, in principle, choose another member, even if Powell remains on the board.Attempting to fire Powell entirely—as a governor—would be the boldest move. If successful, it would create a board and chair vacancy, giving Trump a chance to reshape Fed leadership in his own image. But such a step would almost certainly face a legal challenge.Powell, a former lawyer and investment banker, has repeatedly insisted that the law protects his position. If fired, he could mount a federal court case using his personal wealth to fund the effort.Reuters also reports that Trump has floated the idea of replacing Powell with former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, though Warsh reportedly advised against the move, urging Trump to allow Powell to finish his term, which ends in May 2026.White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett—also rumored as a potential successor—confirmed last week that the idea of removing Powell is under review within the administration.So—can Trump fire Powell? Legally uncertain. Politically explosive. Economically risky.But one thing is clear: the showdown over central bank independence may be just beginning.","US President Donald Trump fired a fresh salvo against Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

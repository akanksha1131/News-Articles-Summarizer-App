Top stock market recommendations:Nifty has broken out from its 3 week consolidation and now stands at an eight month closing highs. With the index holding above 25050 resistance level for the past 3 consecutive days. This confirms a breakout from the range for higher targets of 25400 / 25600 however the support is far below at 24650. This is because for the past two days markets have closed lower than its open despite ending in green.Bank Nifty broke out into fresh all-time highs after the monetary policy announcement as the index reclaimed its wall of worry. Outperformance of Bank Nifty is likely to continue for this week’s trade as well as the index resumes further upside towards 57200 / 57600 odd, however fresh longs are likely to provide good risk to reward only on dips towards 56200.Tata Motors stock has seen a 5-7% corrective consolidation in the past 3 weeks of trade which was an after effect of a sharp 40% rally before that. With supportive news flow for domestic players in the new EV policy acting as tailwind, passenger vehicle stocks are likely to see further momentum.Tata Motors is a cleaner set up amongst the peers on charts for another 6-8% rally from CMP.After trading at an 18 month low in April, Mphasis has been rising in a steep upward moving channel. A typical higher high – higher low formation underlines the bullish set up and inflows on the counter. The stock has widely outperformed its benchmark NIFTYIT index on a YTD basis which is down over 12% while LTIM is down 6% in the same period of 2025. A move towards the higher range of the bullish channel is likely to unfold for a target of 2850-2900.Having run up nearly 30% from its recent low in March – Hero Motocorp is now on verge of breaking out from an inverse head and shoulder pattern formation for fresh upside retesting its December 2024 highs. A bullish flag breakout is about to commence for targets aimed 10% higher from CMP.","According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Tata Motors, Mphasis, and Hero Motocorp are the top buy calls for today.

'Bully U.S. Won't Stop': China MOCKS Trump Just After His Big Trade Deal Announcement With Xi

Wall Street futures slipped on Wednesday morning, even as the United States and China reached a broad consensus on advancing a trade deal after months of tit-for-tat tariffs.The agreement followed two days of high-level talks in London, building on earlier discussions in Geneva.Despite the positive steps in diplomacy, US market showed a muted reaction. Dow futures fell by 110 points, while S&P 500 futures dipped slightly below the flat line, and Nasdaq futures dropped 60 points.However on Tuesday, the major US indexes inched closer to record highs as talks between the world’s two largest economies carried into a second day.S&P 500 rose 0.5% to 6,038.81, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2% to 42,866.87, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6% to 19,714.99, as investors kept a close eye on the ongoing US-China negotiations.Share prices had significantly recovered since falling approximately 20% below their record two months ago, following Donald Trump's unexpected announcement of severe tariffs that sparked recession concerns.The market's upward trajectory was largely driven by expectations that Trump would reduce tariffs after securing trade agreements globally, bringing the S&P 500 within 1.7% of its February record.""The talks with China were going 'really, really well,'"" US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick stated Tuesday evening in London, where negotiations were taking place.Both nations have suspended many of their announced tariffs during ongoing discussions.The late Tuesday agreement boosted Asian markets, with Hong Kong and Shanghai leading the gains, alongside positive performance in Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Wellington, Taipei and Manila.The US benchmark indices moved closer to their record highs on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq outperforming, boosted by a third straight day of gains in Tesla, which has nearly erased its losses from June 4 and 5.Tesla shares jumped 5.7% to $326.09, climbing back above after last week's slump, which was partly triggered by tensions between Elon Musk and Donald Trump.Investor sentiment was further lifted after Musk announced that Tesla’s long-awaited robotaxi service is ""tentatively"" set to launch in Austin on June 22.Meanwhile, J M Smucker saw its stock plunge 15.6% despite beating earnings estimates. Investors reacted to weaker-than-expected revenue and a disappointing profit outlook for the year ahead.On Tuesday, the World Bank lowered its global growth forecast for 2025 to 2.3%, down from 2.7% projected in January, citing ongoing trade tensions and economic uncertainty. It also cut the US growth forecast for 2025 to 1.4%, down sharply from the 2.8% growth expected in 2024.","Dow futures fell by 110 points, while S&P 500 futures dipped slightly below the flat line, and Nasdaq futures dropped 60 points.

If the rollout happens as planned, it would mark a major milestone in Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) program—a technology that has faced years of delays and criticism.Musk also revealed that the first Tesla to fully ""drive itself from the factory end of line all the way to a customer house is June 28.""Earlier, Musk responded to a video on X showing what appears to be one of Tesla's first robotaxis in Austin, a Model Y carrying a passenger with no driver behind the wheel.The car had a ""Robotaxi"" logo on its side.""These are unmodified Tesla cars coming straight from the factory, meaning that every Tesla coming out of our factories is capable of unsupervised self-driving!"" Musk wrote on X.Investors, analysts, and Tesla fans have been closely watching for this moment since Musk said earlier this year that the robotaxi service would launch in Austin sometime in June.In an interview with CNBC last month, Musk outlined initial plans for the service, stating that the vehicles would operate under remote supervision and ""geofenced"".He indicated plans to begin with approximately 10 vehicles, with rapid expansion planned for other metropolitan areas including Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Francisco.Musk has spent years promising fully self-driving Teslas “next year,” but now the pressure is real as the company begins rolling out its robotaxi service. Tesla's electric vehicle sales have recently dipped, hit by rising competition, the revamp of its popular Model Y, and the backlash from Musk’s political statements.The Austin launch coincides with a reported clash between Musk and US President Donald Trump over tax policy. Some analysts worry this could lead to more scrutiny from federal safety regulators if problems arise with the robotaxis.Still, Wall Street remains hopeful.

Gold Price Outlook

Gold Price Weekly View: Cautious Upside (1 – 2 Weeks)

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold rate is expected to see a limited upside in the short-term, feel analysts. As global trade tensions show signs of easing with progress on US-China trade deal talks, the safe haven appeal of gold is not as strong right now. What should investors do? What is the gold price outlook for the coming days and should investors shift focus on silver? Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers shares his views and recommendations:Gold prices ended last week with marginal gains (weekly close $ 3310) despite prices soaring to above $ 3400 per oz earlier in last week in Spot as steady macro cues from US along with ease in trade tensions between US & China weighed on sentiments and limited its upside trajectory.US President Donald Trump announced that Chinese President Xi Jinping has agreed to resume the export of rare earth minerals and magnets to the United States. The statement was made aboard Air Force One, as reported by Reuters, highlighting a potential easing of trade tensions between the two economic giants. The US had also indicated it may soften certain restrictions on technology exports in exchange for the same.Modest US jobs growth in May lifted the dollar marginally last week. Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) in the United States (US) climbed as came in stronger than the market expectation as Federal Fund Futures pointed to a larger chance that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) may keep its benchmark interest rate steady at its next two monetary policy meetings.In other news, China’s central bank expanded its gold reserves for a seventh straight month in May, furthering its bid to diversify holdings despite ongoing price fluctuations. The People’s Bank of China added 60,000 troy ounces of the metal to its reserves last month, taking the total to 73.83 million fine troy ounces, according to data released Saturday. However the same indicated a slowdown in pace of accumulation by the central bank which did not bring in any substantial hike in prices during the start of the current week.Traders to closely monitor US CPI (May) and PPI (May) data as any unexpected surprise in readings could lead to indications of delayed rate hike keeping sentiments muted.Market attention also remains fixed on the London discussions, where US and Chinese officials have indicated progress in trade deal.Meanwhile Silver, witnessing a breakout to 13 year highs last week had finally started to join the rally that gold started months ago. More than 8% move seen in silver prices since last week were on account of safe haven demand, due to escalating geopolitics on the Russia-Ukraine front combined with trade uncertainties and also driven by Industrial demand.We continue to expect limited upside in Gold for a short term perspective as any spike towards $3360 - 3390 per oz in Spot (CMP $3330 per oz) still remains a selling opportunity for the yellow metal.On MCX Aug futures (CMP Rs. 97,075/10 gm) prices could trade in a broad range of Rs 98,500 – 95,000 per 10 gm for the coming week. MCX Silver is expected to remain steady as compared to Gold while may trade in a broad range of Rs 1,04,500 – 1,09,000 per kg. in July futures contract as a combined Sell gold/Buy silver strategy could remain favourable on short to medium term perspective.Also silver looks set to outperform gold in the current year as we expect silver to continue to rise in the range of $ 38.70 - 41.50 per oz in International spot markets (CMP $ 36.65 per oz) in the current year. This translates to a level of Rs 1,15,000 – 1,23,000 per kg. in the MCX futures market in 2025 providing further returns of almost 15 – 20% from current levels.","Gold price prediction today: Gold rate is expected to see a limited upside in the short-term, feel analysts.

Full India-US trade pact may take time; govt awaits clarity on Trump’s policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/full-india-us-trade-pact-may-take-time-govt-awaits-clarity-on-trumps-policy/articleshow/121789433.cms,"India-US trade deal (Representative AI image)

NEW DELHI: While India and the US work towards finalising an ""initial tranche"" of the proposed trade deal before July 9, the full bilateral trade agreement may take a few months as the Trump administration is yet to spell out its policy on trade, beyond using tariffs to get countries on the negotiating table.A long-lasting agreement will require the US to move beyond a case-by-case approach, which can form the basis for a durable agreement, sources said. Besides, there are issues, such as how the tariff cuts committed by the US Trade Representative will be implemented, as there is no clarity on whether the reduction will need to be cleared by the US Congress. Already, the legal challenge to Trump's reciprocal tariffs has created some uncertainty on how the duties cuts will be negotiated.After a meeting between PM Modi and Trump in Feb, the two countries had agreed to negotiate a bilateral trade deal by Fall (Sept-Oct), before the US President decided to roll out reciprocal tariffs on April 2, only to suspend it later.Even the deal that the Trump administration has managed to negotiate with the UK and China are not final agreements but are in the nature of interim trade agreements, given the repeated flip-flops.These also include the American president focusing on certain sectors. For instance, while successive US administrations have made a case for lower duty for Harley Davidson (although it uses its Asia plant to ship superbikes), the push to lower duties for cars was seen in the context of Tesla boss Elon Musk's close ties with Trump, until the bitter fallout last week.While negotiating the agreement with the US, govt has some key factors in mind: One, it wants to secure the best possible deal for its businesses so that they can get market access in return for lower duties in India. Sources have argued that an agreement will give American companies access to a market of close to 1.5 billion people.Two, govt is keeping a close eye on how the tariffs are being reset for other countries as competitiveness is a key parameter for Indian exporters. Unlike some of the countries, which offer dollops of subsidy for their businesses, govt only provides refunds of actual taxes and duties. Three, govt is keen to ensure that its sensitivities in several segments, such as agriculture, in segments like staples are fully on board.In any case, the current negotiations are focused on goods trade, along with trade facilitation & customs and rules or origin, with India's interests in services not getting addressed at the moment.","India and the US work towards finalising an ""initial tranche"" of the proposed trade deal before July 9.

Flex-fuel drive: Ministry seeks lower GST on crude ethanol,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gadkari-seeks-gst-cut-on-crude-ethanol-to-boost-flex-fuel-vehicles/articleshow/121790036.cms,"NEW DELHI: At a time when the Centre and states are discussing the rationalisation of the GST structure, road transport minister Nitin Gadkari sought a reduction in the levy on crude ethanol from 18% to 5% to encourage the manufacturing and sale of flex-fuel vehicles.At present, GST on ethanol used for blending with petrol under the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme is 5%. Sources said Gadkari suggested parity in the GST rate for both crude ethanol and the green fuel used for blending in petrol. Currently, around 400 fuel pumps sell 100% ethanol, but demand remains muted.“Why will people go for these vehicles if the price of crude ethanol is equal to or more than that of petrol? Hence there is a need to bring down the GST rate,” a source said.The suggestion for lower taxes comes at a time when the Centre has taken up a holistic review of the GST structure, instead of limiting it to a select set of goods and services such as life and health insurance. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and a team of officials at the Centre are looking at the issue in detail before they present the proposals and seek to evolve a consensus.At least two groups of ministers comprising representatives from the states were set up, but the suggestions made by them were not seen to be complete.A third group of ministers is tackling the issues of cesses as the compensation cess is due to end in March.While there is reluctance from state finance ministers to tinker with the four slabs of 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, there is growing demand from industry that rationalisation is the need of the hour given that there are several items on which classification concerns have emerged since the regime kicked in eight years ago.Besides, the structure is such that almost two-thirds of the collections come from the 18% slab, although a majority of the items are in the 5% bracket, which yields very little revenue. In the past, there have been discussions around merging the 12% and 18% slabs and putting items in these two brackets at 15-16%. While it will result in some revenue loss, there could also be a political challenge given that items in the 12% bracket will see a higher levy.","Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari sought a reduction in the levy on crude ethanol from 18% to 5% to encourage the manufacturing and sale of flex-fuel vehicles.

The company surpassed $1 billion in revenue during the financial year 2022-23, demonstrating a year-on-year growth of 22.4% in constant currency terms. Digital engineering company Nagarro’s revenue crossed $1 billion in the 2023 financial year, up from $908 million in the corresponding period last year. Nagarro follows a January to December financial year. The company recorded a growth of 9.4% in constant currency in 2023. Of Nagarro’s 18,000 employees, 12,000 are based in India across 12 cities.While these companies were growth-ready, former Cognizant India CMD Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, in a LinkedIn post, said three powerful forces have redefined their trajectory. Seasoned leaders from tier-1 firms brought strategic clarity, global perspective, and execution muscle—sharpening the edge of mid-tier companies.Private equity as a growth engine and an imbibed long-term value mindset accelerated transformation and scaling ambitions. Mid-tier players rapidly built and scaled advanced digital capabilities—closely aligned with evolving client expectations.Ramamoorthy said, “One of the best things that happened to Indian IT after Y2K is senior management attrition. Seasoned leaders who built and ran large portfolios in IT companies such as Cognizant, Infosys, and HCL took on CXO roles in mid-sized firms and built the much-needed muscles to gracefully scale these companies. With more such leaders being made available today, in the years to come, we should see a larger number of companies get past the magical $1 billion in revenue, ably compete with Tier-1 players, and catalyse growth. ” He is also a partner in tech growth advisory firm Catalincs.In the last four months, nearly a dozen mid-sized firms saw top deck changes. LTIMindtree welcomed Venu Lambu as their new chief executive, while Virtusa brought in Nitin Banga from Global Logic to lead as their CEO. Rohit Kedia, who brings 28 years of experience in technology and digital engineering, was appointed CEO at ChrysCapital-owned digital engineering company Xoriant. He previously served as chief growth officer at LTIMindtree. Engineering services firm Cyient appointed Sukamal Banerjee as CEO of its DET (digital, engineering and technology) business.“Also, with dozens of PE firms making a beeline for the IT industry, the investee companies are a big draw for these leaders not only for CXO roles but also for Board positions. These firms bring in global best practices across all aspects of business—people, process, platforms, partnerships, among others—which also helps fast-track the journey to a billion dollars and more.”Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and chairman of US-based IT advisory Everest Group, said, “However, perhaps the most important factor has been the PE firm’s ability to change the mindset of these firms and attract some of the industry’s most capable executives to run them. The combination of first-rate executives, acquisitions, and focused investments in sales and marketing has proven a sure-fire recipe to drive highly profitable and fast growth. ”These shifts have repositioned mid-tier companies as credible contenders, not just fast followers—rewriting what growth looks like in the industry’s next chapter.","15 mid-tier IT firms have crossed the $1 billion revenue mark in the past decade.

HC orders refund of input tax credit on closure of operations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hc-orders-refund-of-input-tax-credit-on-closure-of-operations/articleshow/121789843.cms,"MUMBAI: The Sikkim high court has ruled that businesses are entitled to a refund of unutilised input tax credit (ITC) even upon the discontinuation or closure of operations. The order follows a writ petition filed by SICPA India, a private limited company, which had sought a refund of about Rs 4.4 crore in unutilised ITC after ceasing its manufacturing activities in Sikkim.SICPA, which was a manufacturer of security inks and solutions, had decided to discontinue its Sikkim operations in Jan 2019, selling off its machinery and facilities by March 2020. The company had appropriately reversed ITC on asset sales but was left with a significant unutilised balance in its electronic credit ledger.The company challenged earlier orders from the assistant commissioner and the appellate authority, which had rejected SICPA India's refund application. The authorities had maintained that Section 54(3) of the CGST Act, 2017, limits ITC refunds to only two specific circumstances, neither of which includes business closure.However, SICPA argued that section 49(6) of the CGST Act provides for the refund of balances in the electronic credit ledger, subject to Section 54. They contended that the exceptions carved out in Section 54(3) cannot negate a vested right to ITC and its refund.Ankit Kanodia, one of the advocates which represented the company told TOI, ""The HC examined the provisions of Sections 49(6) and 54(3) of the CGST Act and relevant case laws, including that of the Karnataka HC, in the case of Slovak India Trading, where refunds of unutilised credit were allowed upon business closure. The HC held that there is no express prohibition in the CGST Act against refunding unutilised ITC upon business closure and that retention of tax without authority of law is impermissible. ""The judgment stated, ""Although, Section 54(3) of the CGST Act deals only with two circumstances where refunds can be made, however the statute also does not provide for retention of tax without the authority of law."" Consequently, in a significant judgment, the HC held that SICPA is entitled to the refund of unutilised ITC claimed by them.","The Sikkim high court has ruled that businesses are entitled to a refund of unutilised input tax credit (ITC) even upon the discontinuation or closure of operations.

Putin's Men TORCH Ukrainian Positions With Deadly Flamethrowers | Watch Chilling Donetsk Battle





Argentina's highest court upheld a six-year prison sentence for former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner in a ruling Tuesday that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.The explosive Supreme Court ruling left Fernandez, Argentina's charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, subject to arrest and sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital, and blocking major highways in protest.The court asked Argentina's security ministry to set up a detention centre to hold 72-year-old Fernandez. Her defense lawyer Carlos Beraldi told C5N, a television station in Buenos Aires, that he had requested Fernandez be allowed to serve her sentence in house arrest given her age.The ruling bars Fernandez from running in this fall's Buenos Aires legislative elections just days after she launched her campaign.Fernandez, who dominated Argentine politics for two decades and forged the country's main left-wing populist movement known as Kirchnerism, after her and her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner, rejects the charges as politically motivated.During Fernandez's eight years in office (2007-2015), Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs.But her governments funded the unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for massive budget deficits and sky-high inflation.Critics blamed Argentina's years of economic volatility on Fernandez's policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country's bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian President Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.The ruling dealt a severe blow to Milei's opposition during a crucial midterm election year. He celebrated the ruling, writing on social media: ""Justice. Period.""Fernandez was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She was convicted in 2022 in this corruption case, which centred on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to Lazaro Baez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate ally in a scheme that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.The high court rejected Fernandez's request for the court to review her prison sentence in March. In a resolution obtained by The Associated Press, the court said that the prison sentence ""does nothing more than to protect our republican and democratic system.""The Kirchner governments carried out ""an extraordinary fraudulent maneuver"" that harmed the interests of the government and resulted in the embezzlement of roughly $70 million at the current exchange rate, the resolution said.Supporters of Fernandez and her political movement blocked main roads into Buenos Aires and stormed the offices of Argentina's two main cable networks that are widely considered critical of the ex-leader, Channel 13 and Todos Noticias, smashing televisions, vandalising cars and shattering windows. There were no injuries reported.Fernandez rejected the decision, calling the court justices ""puppets"" of those wielding economic power in the country.""They're three puppets answering to those ruling far above them,"" she told supporters in a rousing speech outside her party's headquarters. ""It's not the opposition. It's the concentrated economic power of Argentina's government.""Gregorio Dalbon, one of Fernandez's lawyers, vowed ""to take this case to all international human rights organisations.""Fernandez has questioned the impartiality of the judges. She claims her defense didn't have access to much of the evidence and that it was gathered without regard to legal deadlines.Fernandez faces a series of other upcoming trials on corruption charges.","Argentina's highest court upheld a six-year prison sentence for former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.

MUMBAI: Zeeshan Akhtar (22), a Punjab resident and wanted key conspirator in the murder of NCP politician Baba Siddique, has reportedly been detained in Canada, it was learnt on Tuesday.While police here are yet to receive a confirmation, sources said Akhtar had been detained on Interpol's notice and had been in Canadian police custody for over a week.Linked to the Lawrence and Anmol Bishnoi gang. Akhtar is the second accused to be detained in Canada after Anmol.Akhtar is accused of planning the killing and funding it through over 10 bank accounts.Investigators say Akhtar coordinated with jailed shooter Gurmel Singh and other accused, and arranged weapons and shelter for the assailants. He left Mumbai a month before the murder in Oct to avoid suspicion.So far, 26 accused have been arrested, including Shivkumar Gautam alias Shiva, who is accused of firing the shots at Siddique,from various places, including Pune, Bahraich (Uttar Pradesh), Haryana, Dombivli and Karjat.A chargesheet is set to be filed against all 26 under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).The 66-year-old Siddique was shot dead by three assailants outside his son Zeeshan's office in Bandra (East) on the night of Oct 12.While Zeeshan alleged that a builder lobby carrying out an SRA project was behind his father's murder, police ruled out this angle. The police chargesheet claimed that Lawrence's Canada-based brother Anmol was behind the murder. It stated that the murder was a fallout of Siddiqui's alleged links with Dawood Ibrahim and Salman Khan.","Zeeshan Akhtar, 22, is a suspect in Baba Siddique's murder.

BSE share price plunges: BSE Ltd shares declined 4% to Rs 2,885.20 on the NSE on Wednesday after the exchange placed the stock under Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework, leading to wariness amongst investors.BSE share price has increased by 116.6% over three months and 225.6% in the past year. BSE shares have risen approximately 32% in the previous month and 58.5% over six months. The substantial appreciation in share value likely prompted regulatory attention, as exchanges commonly implement ASM measures to address excessive volatility and speculation.The ASM framework serves as a regulatory instrument utilised by exchanges to supervise and regulate unusual price fluctuations. Securities under ASM face stricter oversight and trading constraints, including elevated margin requirements and restrictions on intraday transactions, aimed at protecting investors and ensuring market stability.The inclusion follows a notable increase in BSE's share price and trading volume. Stock exchanges generally incorporate shares into the ASM category when they observe substantial price movements unsupported by fundamental factors or unusual trading patterns, according to an ET report.BSE shares currently maintain positions above most crucial simple moving averages (SMAs), specifically the 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, 50-day, 100-day, 150-day, and 200-day markers. The stock has, however, dipped beneath the 5-day SMA, indicating recent softening in performance, the report said.The RSI reading of 80.9 exceeds the overbought level of 70, suggesting a potential downward correction. Nevertheless, the MACD maintains a strong positive value of 208.2, positioned above its centre and signal lines, which confirms ongoing bullish sentiment despite the midweek decline.BSE has demonstrated remarkable financial performance, with its recent stock surge supported by exceptional fourth-quarter results. The exchange recorded a substantial 362% year-on-year increase in net profit, reaching Rs 494 crore during January-March 2025. Operational revenue witnessed a 75% year-on-year growth to Rs 847 crore.The operating EBITDA, inclusive of core Settlement Guarantee Fund (SGF) contributions, showed remarkable improvement, rising to Rs 594 crore from Rs 95.7 crore in the previous year. The EBITDA margins showed substantial improvement, reaching 70%.Transaction charges, which constitute a significant revenue source tied to trading volumes, increased by 112% year-on-year to Rs 612 crore, compared to Rs 288 crore in the corresponding period. Investment income improved to Rs 70 crore from Rs 55.2 crore in Q3 FY25, whilst treasury income decreased to Rs 44.3 crore from Rs 58 crore the previous year.The exchange's board announced a combined dividend of Rs 23 per share, comprising Rs 5 as a special dividend commemorating BSE's 150th anniversary and Rs 18 as the standard dividend.","BSE Ltd shares declined 4% to Rs 2,885.20 on the NSE on Wednesday after the exchange placed the stock under Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework.

'Great numbers': Trump pushes US Fed for 'one full point' rate cut after CPI data; markets weigh US-China trade deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/great-numbers-trump-pushes-us-fed-for-one-full-point-rate-cut-after-cpi-data-markets-eye-policy-shift-amid-easing-price-pressures/articleshow/121781837.cms,"US President Donald Trump renewed his call for a full percentage point interest rate cut on Wednesday, citing “great” inflation numbers just released by the Labor Department.“CPI JUST OUT. GREAT NUMBERS! FED SHOULD LOWER ONE FULL POINT. WOULD PAY MUCH LESS INTEREST ON DEBT COMING DUE. SO IMPORTANT!!!” Trump posted on Truth Social, amplifying pressure on the Federal Reserve to act decisively.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% in May from a year earlier, slightly higher than April’s 2.3% but still within a relatively tame range. Core inflation—which excludes food and energy—remained steady at 2.8% for the third straight month. On a month-over-month basis, both headline and core inflation ticked up just 0.1%.The mild headline figures mask complex undercurrents. Grocery prices rose 0.3% from April to May, and are up 2.2% on the year. Price increases were also seen in toys, games, and large appliances—areas potentially exposed to tariffs. Yet declines in the cost of new and used cars, airfares, and hotel stays helped offset the broader impact, at least temporarily.Economists say these soft readings may not last.“You can point to seeing tariffs in this report, but the more important message is that you're seeing inflation soften enough elsewhere that overall, price pressures continue to subside for the US consumer,” said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, as quoted by AP. “I don’t think this report signals an all clear—that tariffs are not going to be a concern for the inflation picture.”Trump’s new tariff regime—55% on all Chinese imports, 10% on goods from all other countries, and 50% on steel and aluminum—has so far had a delayed effect on prices. Analysts attribute this to companies front-loading inventories before duties kicked in and holding off on price hikes amid fluctuating trade announcements.However, that buffer may be ending. Bryan Eshelman, managing director at AlixPartners, expects retail prices—especially for back-to-school items like backpacks and clothes—to jump between 5% and 15% by July.The J.M. Smucker Company has already raised coffee prices in May and plans another hike in August, citing rising costs from 10% tariffs on imports from Brazil and Vietnam. CEO Mark Smucker said green coffee imports—500 million pounds annually—are currently their largest tariff exposure.The Federal Reserve, facing inflation that still runs above its 2% target, is likely to remain cautious. Chair Jerome Powell and others have said they will wait for clearer signs of how tariffs are affecting the economy before moving on rates.","The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% in May from a year earlier, slightly higher than April’s 2.3% but still within a relatively tame range.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 94 points, or 0.2%, as of 12:24 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite edged 0.2% higher.Markets saw more movement in the bond space, where Treasury yields fell after a report showed that inflation in May rose less than economists had expected. Consumer prices were 2.4% higher than a year earlier—slightly above April’s 2.3% rate, but still below the 2.5% forecast by Wall Street.Investors have been concerned that Trump’s broad tariffs might fuel inflation just as the rate appeared to be stabilizing near the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, down from its 9% peak three summers ago. So far, that fear has not materialized, though economists warn that the full impact of the tariffs could take months to emerge.For now, many companies may be relying on existing inventory, instead of immediately passing on higher import costs to consumers.“Another month goes by with little evidence of tariffs, but the longer-term inflation challenge they pose remain,” said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, as quoted AP.Financial markets showed little immediate reaction to the conclusion of two days of US-China trade talks in London. President Trump announced that China will supply rare-earth minerals and magnets to the US, while the US will allow Chinese students to attend American universities as part of a broader agreement still awaiting final approval by both Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.“President XI and I are going to work closely together to open up China to American Trade. This would be a great WIN for both countries!!!” Trump said Wednesday on social media.Markets remain hopeful for a larger, more comprehensive trade agreement that could ease tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. Optimism over potential deals has been a major force behind the S&P 500’s rebound, which has nearly reclaimed its record level after dropping about 20% earlier this year. Without such agreements, high tariffs could raise inflation and risk pushing the US economy into a recession.In corporate news, Chewy shares slid 9.3% after the pet supply retailer reported quarterly profits below analyst expectations, despite a strong year-to-date rally of nearly 37%.Tesla shares rose 1.7%, helping to support broader markets. The stock has been rebounding after last week’s losses stemming from Elon Musk’s public fallout with President Trump. Musk has since softened his remarks, saying on Wednesday that some of his previous comments “went too far.”In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.43% from 4.47% on Tuesday. Shorter-term yields—more sensitive to Fed rate expectations—declined even more.The moderate inflation reading has increased speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates at least twice before year-end. So far in 2025, the Fed has kept rates steady after last year’s cuts, watching carefully to see how tariffs might influence inflation. Lowering rates now could help support growth but also risks reigniting inflation.“The Fed could be justified in doing some preemptive rate cuts,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “They were afraid that inflation would rise before growth would slow, but the script has been flipped and they will likely change their tune.”Globally, European stock indexes fell, while Asian markets mostly rose. South Korea’s Kospi led the gains with a 1.2% jump.","The S&P 500 was down just 0.1%, keeping it only 1.8% below its all-time high.

Price pressure hits America : US inflation ticks up to 2.4% in May; rate-cut hopes dim as CPI rises,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/price-pressure-hits-america-us-inflation-ticks-up-to-2-4-in-may-food-costs-rise-as-rate-cut-hopes-dim/articleshow/121779841.cms,"US inflation crept higher in May as rising grocery bills nudged annual consumer prices up to 2.4%, rekindling questions about the Federal Reserve’s room to lower interest rates amid a fresh wave of trade tariffs.Core inflation — which excludes volatile food and energy prices — held steady at 2.8% for the third consecutive month, remaining above the Fed’s 2% target. The monthly inflation increase slowed to 0.1%, both for overall and core measures, from 0.2% in April.Grocery costs rose 0.3% month-on-month, led by cereals, frozen foods, and produce. Egg prices fell for a second straight month but remain over 40% higher than a year ago.The data, released Wednesday by the US Labour Department, signals continued pressure on consumers even as overall inflation has moderated from pandemic-era highs.President Donald Trump’s expansive tariff regime looms large in the inflation outlook. The White House this week confirmed that all Chinese imports will face a 55% tariff — up from 30% — while a 10% base tariff will apply to goods from all other countries.Steel and aluminum imports will face a 50% duty.Though some categories such as apparel and travel services saw price declines in May, economists warn that tariffs could fuel cost increases in cars, food, and durable goods in the second half of the year.“Trump’s tariffs may already be lifting some prices, but their full impact will likely play out in the coming months,” said one analyst.That uncertainty has led the Fed to signal a pause on any immediate interest rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank will keep its key rate steady until the inflation trajectory becomes clearer, especially in light of trade policy shifts.Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is scaling back the scope of its data collection — a move that has sparked concern among economists. While the reduction is not expected to drastically change inflation readings, analysts say it could introduce more volatility to future reports.Inflation trends had shown signs of aligning with the Fed’s target before the tariff hikes. Core prices, once stuck between 3.2% and 3.4% for nearly a year, have declined to 2.8% since February. But with new trade barriers in place, the path to rate relief may now be less certain.","Grocery costs rose 0.3% month-on-month, led by cereals, frozen foods, and produce.

Trump raises China tariffs to 55% even as rare earth deal advances; rights group flags forced labour risks in Xinjiang mineral supply chains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trade-truce-tested-trump-raises-china-tariffs-to-55-even-as-rare-earth-deal-advances-rights-group-flags-forced-labour-risks-in-xinjiang-mineral-supply-chains/articleshow/121779631.cms,"Photo credit- AP

US President Donald Trump said the United States will receive magnets and rare earth minerals from China under a new deal, even as tariffs on Chinese goods are set to rise to 55%. The development comes amid renewed scrutiny over supply chains tied to China’s Xinjiang region, where human rights groups allege the use of forced labour.The rare earth announcement and tariff hike followed two days of trade talks in London, where the US and China reached a tentative framework to resume stalled negotiations. The discussions reportedly focused on easing mineral and technology-related disputes that had threatened to unravel a fragile truce reached in Geneva last month, AP reported.The move comes as a new report by Netherlands-based Global Rights Compliance identified 77 Chinese companies in the titanium, lithium, beryllium, and magnesium sectors operating in Xinjiang—many allegedly linked to state-run “labour transfer programs” involving Uyghur and other Turkic minorities.According to the report, these supply chains potentially impact global brands such as Avon, Walmart, Nescafe, Coca-Cola, and Sherwin-Williams, who may source materials like titanium from Xinjiang. These minerals are used in a range of products, from commercial paints and thermos cups to aerospace and auto components.“Mineral mining and processing in Xinjiang rely in part on the state’s forced labour programs for Uyghurs and other Turkic people in the region,” the report stated, urging companies to re-evaluate their sourcing.China’s Foreign Ministry rejected the findings, calling them fabricated. “No one has ever been forcibly transferred in Xinjiang under work programs,” said spokesperson Lin Jian. “The so-called allegation of forced labour is nothing but a lie concocted by certain anti-China forces.”While the companies named in the report have not commented, the issue echoes long-standing concerns. A 2022 UN report said China may have committed crimes against humanity in the region, citing arbitrary detention of over 1 million Uyghurs.Under US law signed in 2021, imports from Xinjiang are blocked unless companies can prove their goods are free of forced labour. Initially targeting solar panels, tomatoes, and textiles, enforcement has since expanded to cover aluminum and seafood.The International Energy Agency recently warned that global critical mineral supply is becoming highly concentrated, with China dominating the refining and processing of lithium, cobalt, graphite, and other key inputs—many of which originate in or pass through Xinjiang.Despite the intensifying scrutiny, Trump’s announcement signals that the US continues to rely on China for essential mineral supplies, even as broader trade tensions escalate.","US President Donald Trump said the United States will receive magnets and rare earth minerals from China under a new deal.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

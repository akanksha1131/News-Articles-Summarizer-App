"Oil prices hold steady near $68 ahead of US–Iran talks, OPEC+ supply plans keep markets cautious",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/oil-prices-hold-steady-near-68-ahead-of-usiran-talks-opec-supply-plans-keep-markets-cautious/articleshow/128403955.cms,"Representative AI image

Global oil prices remained steady on Monday as markets closely watch upcoming talks between United States and Iran. While concerns over potential disruptions in oil supply due to US-Iran tensions kept prices stable, OPEC+ is considering increasing production from April. The day saw Brent crude futures slightly down at $67.72 per barrel, while US WTI crude stood at $62.86.The market's cautious stance comes ahead of crucial negotiations between Washington and Tehran in Geneva on Tuesday. These talks aim to resolve their long-running dispute over Iran's nuclear program. Both benchmarks had declined last week after US President Donald Trump suggested a possible deal with Iran within a month.An Iranian diplomat revealed that Iran seeks a nuclear agreement offering mutual economic benefits, including investments in energy and mining sectors, along with aircraft purchases. However, market analyst Tony Sycamore said, ""With both sides expected to hold firm on their core red lines, expectations are low that a deal can be reached and this is likely to be the calm before the storm,"" as quoted by Reuters.Military tensions have escalated, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the region.However, Iran's Revolutionary Guards have threatened to retaliate against US military bases if their territory is attacked.Meanwhile, OPEC+ is considering resuming oil production increases after a three-month pause to meet summer demand. ""The market reacted reasonably well to those reports,"" Sycamore commented, adding ""If that geopolitical premium or support wasn't there, crude oil would likely be trading sub $60 this morning.""Trading activity is expected to be quiet on Monday with several Asian markets, including China, South Korea, and Taiwan, closed for holidays.","Brent crude futures slightly down at $67.72 per barrel, while US WTI crude stood at $62.86.

The acquisition of Ecom Express has significantly strengthened Delhivery’s network reach and accelerated consolidation within the logistics sector, enabling the company to gain share as smaller players face margin stress. In 3QFY26, performance remained robust, with EBITDA margins expanding to 7.4%, supported by strong volume traction in the Express Parcel and Part Truck Load segments.Segment-level margin improvement to 18.1% and 11%, respectively, highlights the benefits of operating leverage and improved realizations. With the heavy investment phase largely complete and capital intensity moderating, free cash flow generation is set to improve.Management continues to target steady-state margins of 16–18% in core transportation, with additional upside from Supply Chain Services and newer offerings such as Delhivery Direct and Rapid, positioning the company for structurally stronger profitability ahead.Britannia delivered a resilient 3QFY26 with revenue growth of 9.5% YoY, impacted in October by GST-led trade disruptions but witnessing normalization thereafter, with ~12% growth in November–December driven by healthy volumes across biscuits and adjacent categories.Profitability was a key highlight, with gross margin expanding 450bp YoY to 43.3% on stable commodity prices, leading to EBITDA margin of 20.7% and APAT growth of 23% YoY.While dual price points in LUP packs created temporary trade distortion, this is expected to stabilize. With a large share of portfolio in INR5/INR10 packs, improving e-commerce salience, brand investments under new leadership, and focus on distribution expansion and premium adjacencies, Britannia remains well positioned to drive sustained earnings momentum, supporting a constructive long-term view.","The acquisition of Ecom Express has significantly strengthened Delhivery’s network reach and accelerated consolidation within the logistics sector.

Gold price prediction today: Is gold set to exhibit a bullish bias in the near term?

Gold price prediction

today:

Gold prices have pulled back from recent highs, but there is an underlying bullish bias, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

Below is his outlook for gold prices today and this week, along with top factors that will influence the movement of the yellow metal:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold is hovering around $5,000 after weaker-than-expected US inflation reinforced expectations of Fed easing, driving the 10-year US Treasury yield lower with market participants to price nearly 50% odds of a third rate cut by December. Inflation data last week was reported 0.1% lower than estimates.Recent comments from Kevin Warsh signaling a preference for lower policy rates add to expectations of two 25bp cuts in March and June, which would further compress real yields and support gold inflows. Geopolitical risks remain elevated, with reports of Washington deploying the USS Gerald R. Ford to the Middle East amid stalled Iran nuclear talks boosting safe-haven demand.Meanwhile, markets are increasingly focused on the potential inflationary impact of renewed tariff threats from Trump, alongside lingering questions over Fed credibility.Notably, gold is trading at a discount for the first time in nearly a month even as Chinese demand strengthens, with Shanghai warehouse stocks crossing 100 tonnes, highlighting robust physical buying interest.Focus this week will be on FOMC meeting minutes, PCE price index. The US market remains shut amidst the President's day holiday while China’s market remains shut for the week amidst lunar new year.Technically, MCX Gold on the daily chart continues to maintain a broader bullish bias despite the recent pullback, with price holding well above the key medium-term support zone near 148,000–150,000, which coincides with the 20-day moving average and prior breakout levels. Immediate resistance is seen around 158,000–160,000, where recent highs and upper supply zones are clustered; a sustained close above this band could open the path toward fresh highs.Fibonacci retracement levels suggest strong structural support near the 0.382 and 0.5 zones around 139,000–134,000 on a deeper correction, keeping the broader uptrend intact unless these levels are decisively breached. Volume patterns indicate that the sharp spike seen during the recent sell-off was not followed by sustained heavy distribution, suggesting profit booking rather than trend reversal.From a Bollinger Band perspective, price recently touched the upper band during the rally and has since cooled toward the middle band (20-SMA), indicating volatility compression and potential base formation; if price stabilizes above the mid-band and bands begin to expand again, it would favor a continuation move higher, whereas a decisive break below the middle band could trigger short-term corrective pressure toward lower supports.","Gold prices have pulled back from recent highs, but there is an underlying bullish bias, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Gold is hovering around $5,000 after weaker-than- expected US inflation reinforced expectations of Fed easing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128408481,imgsize-43512,width-400,resizemode-4/gold-price-prediction.jpg"

“Delhi Fully Prepared For AI Summit,” Says Kuljeet Chahal As NDMC Unveils Grand Illumination Drive

In just a few hours, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to open India’s biggest global AI summit as top technology leaders and global government heads descend in New Delhi for the AI Impact Summit 2026.The summit, running from February 16 to 20 at the sprawling Bharat Mandapam conference complex in the national capital, marks the first time a major global AI forum of this scale is being held in the Global South.It indicates India’s growing clout in the rapidly-evolving world of AI, especially as around 40 technology heads will be speaking at the event including Google’s Sundar Pichai , OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, Adobe’s Shantanu Narayen, Qualcomm’s Cristiano Amon, Ericsson Group President & CEO Borje Ekholm, Meta Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, and Microsoft’s Brad Smith. PM Modi is also slated to host a dinner and address a CEO roundtable.The heads of state set to visit the conference include French President Emmanuel Macron , Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Switzerland’s President Guy Parmelin, Spain’s President Pedro Sanchez Perez, Netherlands’s Prime Minister Dick Schoof, and Estonia’s President Alar Karis.The govt has identified ‘Three Sutras’ which are shaping a sustainable AI future.These are ‘People’, ‘Planet’ and ‘Progress’. “People means AI must serve humanity in all its diversity, preserving dignity and ensuring inclusivity. Planet means AI innovation must align with environmental stewardship and sustainability, and Progress means AI's benefits must be equitably shared, advancing global development and prosperity,” a top official of the IT Ministry said.“India looks forward to welcoming the world to the AI Impact Summit in February 2026. We have picked the theme of Sarvajana Hitaya, Sarvajana Sukhaya or welfare for all, happiness for all,” PM Modi said in a pre-opening message.IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said India’s AI strategy is based on the vision to democratize the use of technology. “It aims to address India centric challenges, create economic and employment opportunities for all.”The summit marks another step in the fast-shifting global dialogue on how artificial intelligence should be governed and developed. The conversation first took structured shape at the AI Safety Summit held at Bletchley Park in November 2023, where 28 nations endorsed the Bletchley Declaration, committing to assess and address emerging risks linked to advanced AI systems.By May 2024, the Seoul Summit widened the lens, moving beyond safety to also highlight innovation and equitable access. The Paris AI Action Summit in February 2025 shifted the focus yet again — this time toward real-world deployment and economic potential — even as concerns around safety and security received comparatively less attention.According to organisers, more than 35,000 registrations have been recorded, with delegates expected to participate in hundreds of sessions that explore the transition from AI research to real-world impact and implementation. The programme has been designed to go beyond abstract debate, aiming to generate actionable recommendations on issues such as ethical AI, data governance, infrastructure, skills and equitable access.","The summit, running from February 16 to 20 at the sprawling Bharat Mandapam conference complex in the national capital, marks the first time a major global AI forum of this scale is being held in the Global South.

What's helping venture capitals to strike out on their own,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/whats-helping-venture-capitals-to-strike-out-on-their-own/articleshow/128403491.cms,"MUMBAI: Earlier this month, when three managing directors at Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia India and Southeast Asia) quit abruptly, that too when the firm was in the thick of closing a fresh billion dollar fund, it became a talking point across investment circles. Ashish Agrawal, Ishaan Mittal and Tejeshwi Sharma will start a new venture capital (VC) firm.It is not really unusual for VC investors to strike out on their own-back in 2015, for instance, when the Indian startup and VC ecosystem was still up and coming, three senior executives quit Helion Ventures to start their own firm Stellaris Venture Partners. Quite a few other instances followed-consider Orios Venture Partners for one, which saw two executives leaving the firm in 2023.What, however, has changed is that more VCs now have the wherewithal to start their own funds. High net worth individuals and family offices are keen on investing in hot tech startups and are more than willing to partner or back new, emerging VC funds. Besides, the govt has lent a helping hand to boost growth of the industry-the Sidbi Fund of Funds, set up with an initial Rs 10,000 crore corpus has allowed many investors some cushion.The fund essentially backs VC firms, enabling them to invest in startups. Another Rs 10,000 crore such fund was announced last year.""They constitute around 30% of various VC funds. VC fundraising has become easier as the asset class has become mainstream,"" said Siddarth Pai, founding partner at 3one4 Capital. Compared to a decade ago, there is materially more capital available for technology in India. The perception of tech businesses has matured, and public markets are more receptive to tech IPOs,"" said Anup Jain, who left as the managing partner at Orios Venture Partners alongside Rajeev Suri to start their own VC firm BlueGreen Ventures in 2024. Large exits or profits accrued from large deals also helps investors to put money into new funds.Starting a fund, however, has its own set of challenges. Investors, when working with established funds typically tend to focus more on investments and the returns they can generate. They do not have a lot of expertise in raising funds. ""Those GPs (general partner) who have had prior experience at handling investor relations, fundraising and compliances in addition to purely investing have an easier ride than those who have only done prior investing,"" said Jain.Even so, having delivered successful bets and scaling startups to growth as well as getting access to the LP (limited partners) network, many VCs are now taking the plunge and starting funds. The recent exits of Agrawal, Mittal and Sharma at Peak XV happened due to disagreements over economics and payouts, MD Shailendra Singh said publicly.While Agrawal parted ways due to what is understood to be discontent over payouts related to Groww whose stellar Rs 6,632 crore IPO delivered big returns for Peak, the rest two followed him. Agrawal in a social media post said he led Groww investment which went on to become the second-most valued new-age public company in India.“As the Indian venture ecosystem matures, spinouts will become increasingly frequent. That’s because there’s both more investment opportunities and more LP capital available in the market. There are too few, not too many, high-quality venture firms in India. When professionals leave to start their own firm, there’s a multiplier effect–founders have another pedigreed venture firm to go to, new investment strategies get funded, and a new class of investment professionals get groomed. Of course, like any entrepreneurial venture, starting a new VC firm is fraught with risk,” said Ritesh Banglani, partner at Stellaris Venture Partners who quit Helion alongside Rahul Chowdhri and Alok Goyal to start the fund in 2016, adding that it took the company more than two years to raise a $90 million fund. “Our own journey at Stellaris has been extremely fulfilling. In hindsight, we should’ve started years before we actually did,” said Banglani.","Three managing directors at Peak XV Partners quit abruptly earlier this month.

Buyouts help PE firms steer companies' future plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/buyouts-help-pe-firms-steer-companies-future-plans/articleshow/128403478.cms,"MUMBAI: India's private equity playbook is evolving. Traditionally, PE investors took minority stakes and let founders run the show. Now, they are increasingly acquiring majority or controlling stakes, shaping companies' futures more directly.While minority investments still dominate deal value, buyouts are gaining ground. Between 2021 to 2025, they made up 24% ($71 billion) of India's total private equity investments of $303 billion, making them the third-largest investment category after growth and startup investments, EY-IVCA data showedIn a transaction last week, US-based Carlyle agreed to acquire a majority stake in Edelweiss's home finance business for $230 million, adding to the growing list of buyouts reshaping India's deal landscape, particularly in financial services, technology, and healthcare.These transactions are largely led by foreign firms such as Blackstone, Brookfield, Carlyle, Advent, EQT and KKR.Unlike in the past, when founders and business families were reluctant to sell to PE, there has been a ""sea change"" in attitude, as PE is now seen as a reliable partner, said Vivek Soni partner (PE services) at EY. ""Succession issues, exits from non-core businesses, buying out other family members or earlier PE investors, and managing volatility risks are key triggers for control trades,"" he added.""Historically, India has seen minority stakes and growth capital play out, but the attractive returns and exit certainty of buyout investments eventually took centre stage,"" said Puncham Mukim, India head of private equity at Everstone Capital, adding that ""From a founder's perspective, the new generation has been more open to control transactions and has undertaken large secondary sales to create family offices. ""While most pure-play buyouts (excluding infrastructure and real estate) have involved sponsors selling controlling stakes to other sponsors, industry expects founders and families to become the largest source of such trades in the coming years.Mukim added ""Sponsors are increasingly acting like strategic investors-building platforms rather than making passive investments."" Their ability to attract seasoned professional managers and strengthen governance has helped them run and scale businesses that were previously family-managed.Soni said PE is doubling down on pure-play buyouts as exit returns have been ""good"". EY-IVCA data showed they realised $48 billion between 2021 and 2025 through exits. Secondary sales accounted for the largest share, followed by strategic exits and stock market listings.While buoyant capital markets offer PE an attractive exit route through IPOs at strong valuations, they are also the biggest competitor in striking control trades. Elevated equity markets raise seller expectations, widen the bid-ask gap between founders and PE buyers, thereby slowing deal closures.","India's private equity playbook is evolving.

It also said that Indian officials have not confirmed that statement, but major refineries have reduced purchases of Russian crude in recent months. India’s crude imports from Russia dropped 27% year-on-year in Sept and 34% in Oct.The US will cut its base tariff rate on goods from India to 18% from 50% under a new trade agreement. This brings down the effective tariff rate from an estimated 25% to around 15%, after key exemptions, said the report.It said India imports more than 30% of its domestic energy needs from Russia, so a pivot away from Russian crude will be pricey.","India-US trade deal goes some way to alleviate stress on Indian exports.

By Jan-end 2026, the incremental credit-deposit (CD) ratio had climbed to 96.9%, sharply higher than the outstanding CD ratio of 82.3%, indicating that banks lent out nearly Rs 97 for every Rs 100 of fresh deposits raised during the year.Data from the Reserve Bank of India showed aggregate deposits grew 10.2% in the financial year to Jan 31, with banks adding Rs 23 lakh crore. Credit expanded faster, rising 12.2% or Rs 22.3 lakh crore over the same period. In the year-ago period, deposits had grown 8.1% and credit 8.7%.On a year-on-year basis, credit growth accelerated to 19-month high of 14.6% as of end-Jan 2026, compared with 11.4% a year earlier, while deposit growth improved to 12.5% from 10.3%. The sustained gap underscores that credit demand remains strong relative to deposit accretion.Non-food credit rose Rs 25.7 lakh crore year-on-year to Rs 203.9 lakh crore. Bankers said the bulk of lending is being funded through household savings rather than surplus central bank liquidity, making credit growth more closely tied to economic activity and GDP expansion.Reflecting the momentum, lenders have raised growth targets, which was communicated in their third quarter earnings call.C S Setty, chairman of State Bank of India, said the bank was ""balancing resource costs alongside growth visibility of at least 10% in corporate credit over the next two quarters, supported by a Rs 7 lakh crore pipeline"", while gaining market share in home and auto loans.

Bain Cap must address stakes in arms for Manappuram buy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bain-cap-must-address-stakes-in-arms-for-manappuram-buy/articleshow/128403131.cms,"MUMBAI: Bain Capital will need to address its holdings in Tyger Capital and Tyger Housing Finance, acquired from the Adani group, to meet regulatory pre-conditions set by RBI for completing its proposed acquisition of joint control in Manappuram Finance, according to disclosures after the central bank granted approval.RBI has cleared Bain entities to acquire up to 41.7% stake and joint control in Manappuram Finance, but the approval is subject to conditions. Any increase in shareholding beyond 26% after one year, other than through warrant conversion under the approved structure, will require prior RBI approval. The regulator has also asked Bain to submit an action plan within a stipulated timeline to ensure that it does not control more than one non-banking financial company or housing finance company of the same category.The approval makes the Manappuram transaction contingent on separate regulatory clearances for its subsidiaries Asirvad Micro Finance and Manappuram Home Finance, and on completion of the mandatory open offer to public shareholders. The investment agreement for the deal was signed in March 2025, and the transaction cannot be consummated until all conditions are met.These requirements draw attention to Bain’s exposure to Tyger Capital and Tyger Housing Finance.The Adani group entities operate in segments overlapping with Manappuram’s businesses, including agriculture finance, MSME lending and affordable housing.

Blackstone leads $1.2 billion raise for homegrown AI firm Neysa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/blackstone-leads-1-2-billion-raise-for-homegrown-ai-firm-neysa/articleshow/128403035.cms,".

BENGALURU: In a big-ticket bet, Blackstone is leading a $1.2 billion funding round in AI cloud platform Neysa, bolstering the company's push to build large-scale AI infrastructure. Blackstone and its co-investors committed up to $600 million in equity, with the company planning to secure an additional $600 million in debt financing, subject to documentation. Other equity investors include Teachers' Venture Growth, TVS Capital, 360 One Asset, and Nexus Venture Partners.Following the investment, the private equity giant will hold a majority stake in the homegrown AI platform. The funding is expected to accelerate Neysa's expansion plans, including scaling its GPU capacity in India to over 20,000 from about 1,200 currently, backing the country's AI buildout. Neysa's AI cloud platform enables enterprises, startups, and PSUs to securely and cost-effectively deploy and scale AI workloads. Neysa, which counts Justpay, Swiggy, and Perfios as key customers, previously raised $50 million.Sharad Sanghi, cofounder of Neysa, said the planned deployment of 20,000 GPUs aligns with India's sovereign AI push. ""India's AI mission is enabling foundational model training by research institutions and private companies.Enterprises increasingly want sovereign AI to ensure data remains within the country, with many financial institutions opting for air-gapped GPUs or private cloud setups-both of which we support. We see strong demand from enterprises, startups, govt bodies, research institutions, and global frontier labs driving rapid growth. With roughly 50,000-60,000 GPUs in India today, we expect that number rises sharply over the next few years."" Following the tax holiday, he said global frontier labs are also increasingly exploring the establishment of inferencing clusters in India. Sanghi, who previously cofounded Netmagic with Anindya Das in 1998 with the goal of becoming India's premier managed hosting service provider, sold the company to Japanese telecom giant NTT Communications in 2012.Ganesh Mani, senior managing director at Blackstone Private Equity, told TOI that it is among the largest investors in AI infrastructure globally and a major owner of data centres, with investments spanning the entire value chain-from cloud platforms to AI labs. ""In India, the GPU infrastructure market is still nascent at about 60,000 units, but we believe it could expand nearly 30-fold to around 2 million in a short period. We are backing what we view as the No 1 management team in this space, with proven technical capabilities and customer validation. Beyond capital, we bring access to our global ecosystem, help secure critical supply chains such as data centre capacity and GPUs, and support go-to-market efforts,"" Mani said.With Neysa raising $600 million in debt, TOI asked about the risks of using GPUs as collateral for high-interest loans. Sanghi said the exposure is largely mitigated by strong contracts, often with AAA-rated companies. He added that while global financing against GPUs can reach loan-to-value ratios of 85%-90%, the company is adopting a more conservative stance at around 50%.Apart from scaling to 20,000 GPUs, Neysa said its roadmap includes enhancing its orchestration platform, expanding its applications marketplace, strengthening security, and building an observability layer to efficiently manage tens of thousands of GPUs. Sanghi added that the company plans to hire talent to support its infrastructure buildout, including systems engineers, network and storage specialists, software developers, and GenAI experts.","Neysa's AI cloud platform enables enterprises, startups, and PSUs to securely and cost-effectively deploy and scale AI workloads.

MUNICH: US secretary of state Marco Rubio has said that India has committed to stop buying Russian oil, days after New Delhi reiterated that ""national interests"" would be the ""guiding factor"" for energy procurement.US President Donald Trump, while announcing a trade deal with New Delhi early in Feb, had said India had agreed to not procure crude oil from Russia. Since then, the US has made this claim multiple times.Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Rubio said, ""In our conversations with India, we've gotten their commitment to stop buying additional Russian oil."" He was responding to a question on the Russia-Ukraine war and the sanctions imposed on Moscow.Responding to a question on whether the trade deal with the US would affect energy ties with Russia at the same conference, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had earlier said India remained firmly committed to strategic autonomy ""because it's a part of our history and our evolution. It's something which is very deep, and something which cuts across the political spectrum as well.""The minister described the global oil market as complex and dynamic. ""Oil companies in India, as in Europe, as probably in other parts of the world, look at availability, look at costs, look at risks and take the decisions that they feel are in their best interest,"" Jaishankar said.After announcing the deal, Trump had in an executive order rolled back the additional 25% tariffs on India that he imposed in Aug over procurement of crude oil from Russia.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio says India has committed to stop buying Russian oil.

IT majors take the biggest hit

Broad-based selloff weighs on markets

The combined market valuation of six of the top-10 most valued firms eroded by more than Rs 3 lakh crore last week, with IT majors Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys emerging as the biggest laggards amid a bearish trend in equities.The 30-share BSE Sensex declined 953.64 points, or 1.14 per cent, during the week.Besides TCS and Infosys, HDFC Bank , Reliance Industries , Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), and Bharti Airtel faced erosion in their valuations.In contrast, State Bank of India (SBI), Bajaj Finance, Larsen & Toubro and ICICI Bank were the gainers.TCS saw its market valuation tumble by Rs 90,198.92 crore to Rs 9,74,043.43 crore, while Infosys’ valuation eroded by Rs 70,780.23 crore to Rs 5,55,287.72 crore.HDFC Bank’s market capitalisation declined by Rs 54,627.71 crore to Rs 13,93,621.92 crore. Reliance Industries’ valuation plunged Rs 41,883 crore to Rs 19,21,475.79 crore.LIC’s market capitalisation dropped Rs 23,971.74 crore to Rs 5,46,226.80 crore, while Bharti Airtel’s valuation declined Rs 19,244.61 crore to Rs 11,43,044.03 crore.On the other hand, SBI’s valuation jumped Rs 1,22,213.38 crore to Rs 11,06,566.44 crore.Bajaj Finance added Rs 26,414.44 crore, taking its market cap to Rs 6,37,244.64 crore, while Larsen & Toubro’s valuation increased Rs 14,483.9 crore to Rs 5,74,028.93 crore. ICICI Bank’s market capitalisation rose Rs 5,719.95 crore to Rs 10,11,978.77 crore.Reliance Industries remained the most valued firm, followed by HDFC Bank, Bharti Airtel, SBI, ICICI Bank, TCS, Bajaj Finance, Larsen & Toubro, Infosys and LIC.The erosion in market capitalisation came amid a broader selloff in equities. On Friday, the Sensex tumbled 1,048.16 points, or 1.25 per cent, to close at 82,626.76, while the NSE Nifty plunged 336.10 points, or 1.30 per cent, to settle at 25,471.10.On a weekly basis, the Nifty declined 222.6 points, or 0.86 per cent.The market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms eroded by Rs 7,02,017.71 crore to Rs 4,65,46,643.20 crore ($5.13 trillion).Weak global cues, a softer earnings season and emerging pressure on technology stocks amid concerns over AI-led disruption dampened sentiment, traders said.Siddhartha Khemka, head of research, wealth management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said the benchmarks nosedived following weaker-than-expected results and continued pressure in technology stocks.“The Nifty IT index touched a 10-month low during the session before closing 1.4 per cent lower, even as selective buying helped it recover from intraday lows. The sector continues to face headwinds amid rising concerns that rapid AI advancements could disrupt traditional service models and weigh on future revenue visibility,” he noted, as quoted by news agency PTI.Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Investments Limited, said sentiment gains from the US-India trade deal have faded as renewed AI-driven disruption fears weigh on risk appetite.“Markets worry that Indian IT firms dependent on the labour arbitrage model may face tougher competitive pressure than their Nasdaq peers,” he said, as per PTI.Sectorally, metal stocks led the decline, falling 3.21 per cent, followed by Realty and Commodities (2.27 per cent each), Utilities (2.26 per cent), Energy (1.94 per cent), Oil & Gas (1.86 per cent), Power (1.85 per cent), FMCG (1.74 per cent) and Services (1.72 per cent).Foreign institutional investors bought equities worth Rs 108.42 crore on Thursday, while domestic institutional investors were net buyers of Rs 276.85 crore, according to exchange data.Overall, last week’s sharp erosion in the valuations of IT heavyweights, coupled with broad-based selling pressure, weighed on the top-10 most valued firms even as select banking and financial stocks bucked the trend.","The 30-share BSE Sensex declined 953.64 points, or 1.14 per cent, during the week.

China Defies UN Sanctions, Helps Iran Rearm After War With Israel, Says Report

US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House on Wednesday to reportedly discuss plans for reducing Iran's oil sales to China, which currently handles over 80 per cent of Iran's oil exports. The agreement comes amid ongoing nuclear talks between US and Iranian officials through Omani mediators.A senior US official told Axios, ""We agreed that we will go full force with maximum pressure against Iran, for example, regarding Iranian oil sales to China,"" as reported by Reuters. This move could significantly impact Iran's oil revenue.The diplomatic efforts coincide with the US positioning a naval fleet in the region. The American military is said to be preparing for potential extended operations against Iran that could last several weeks, according to various media reports.China's response to these developments remains unknown, as no official statement has been given amid the Lunar New Year holiday.In a separate development around US-Iran relations, exiled son of Iran’s last shah Reza Pahlavi, on Saturday called on US President Donald Trump to help the Iranian people, saying it was “time to end the Islamic republic.”Speakingat the Munich Security Conference, Pahlavi said, “It is time to end the Islamic republic.”“This is the demand echoing from the bloodshed of my compatriots who are not asking us to fix the regime but to help them bury it,” he added, as quoted by AFP.Reza Pahlavi directly appealed to Donald Trump, telling reporters, “The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them.”Earlier, Trump had said on Friday that a change of government in Iran would be “the best thing that could happen,” as a second aircraft carrier was deployed to the Middle East to intensify military pressure on the Islamic republic. He had earlier warned of possible military action in support of nationwide protests that peaked in January and were followed by a harsh crackdown that rights groups say left thousands dead.","US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House on Wednesday.

China will remove tariffs on imports from almost all African countries starting May 1, Chinese President Xi Jinping said, according to state media, in a move expected to deepen trade and economic engagement between Beijing and the continent, AFP reported.China already operates a zero-tariff policy for imports from 33 African countries, but Beijing had announced last year that it would expand the policy to all 53 African countries with which it has diplomatic relations.Under the expanded framework, zero levies will apply to all African nations except Eswatini, which maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan. China claims the democratic island as its own and has not ruled out the use of force to assert control over it.China remains Africa’s largest trading partner and has played a major role in infrastructure development across the continent through its Belt and Road Initiative.The move comes at a time when several African countries are diversifying trade relationships, particularly after US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs globally last year.Xi said the zero-tariff arrangement “will undoubtedly provide new opportunities for African development”, while announcing the timeline as leaders across Africa gathered in Ethiopia for the annual African Union summit.The expansion of tariff-free access is expected to strengthen China’s economic influence in Africa while boosting trade flows and market access for African exporters.","China will remove tariffs on imports from almost all African countries starting May 1.

Short-term loan dependence puts Pakistan’s economic stability at risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/short-term-loan-dependence-puts-pakistans-economic-stability-at-risk/articleshow/128338198.cms,"Representative image (AI)

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence

The economy of Pakistan is in a risky state due to its over-reliance on short-term foreign loans, according to business leaders and economists. Key figures are calling for urgent negotiations with friendly nations to extend loan repayment periods and implement structural reforms, as reported by Express Tribune.Vice chairman of the Pakistan industrial and traders associations front (PIAF) Raja Waseem Hassan warned that without extending loan maturities, the country will continue to face balance-of-payments problems. While foreign reserves have grown to $21 billion in January 2026, experts say this improvement relies too heavily on temporary support from international institutions and friendly countries.""The government must immediately begin serious negotiations with friendly nations to secure longer repayment periods and ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves,"" said Hassan. He welcomed recent positive diplomatic developments with Gulf states and the United States but cautioned that these relationships can change quickly.The country's trade performance remains concerning. Exports stood at $32 billion in FY25, while imports continue to exceed export earnings. Dr. Saleem Ahmed, a senior economist, warned that Pakistan can't rely forever on rollovers and short-term deposits. He suggests the country needs 5-6 per cent annual growth to stabilize its debt-to-GDP ratio, which currently hovers around 70 per cent.Economic growth prospects remain modest. The IMF expects 3.6% GDP growth for FY26, while the State Bank of Pakistan projects 3.75-4.75%. Though inflation has dropped from its 38% peak in 2023, strict monetary policies have slowed industrial growth and business lending.Experts recommended focusing on export-oriented sectors like textiles, IT, and agricultural processing. They suggest improving tax collection, reducing energy waste, and boosting remittances, which could reach $42 billion in FY26. They also stress the need to increase foreign direct investment beyond its current annual level of $1.5-2 billion to reduce dependency on external borrowing.Hassan pointedout that while Pakistan's military importance can help in diplomacy, economic strength is crucial for long-term stability. ""Economic strength must be the real shield. Without strong buffers and self-reliance, external partnerships alone cannot guarantee stability,"" he said.","Pakistan's economy is in a risky state due to its over-reliance on short-term foreign loans.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 109 points, or 0.2%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3%, AP reported.Treasury yields declined in the bond market after data showed inflation cooled more than economists had expected last month. Consumer prices were 2.4% higher year-on-year, lower than December’s 2.7%, though still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. An underlying inflation measure — considered a better predictor of future price trends — slowed to its lowest level in nearly five years.“It’s still too high, but only for now, not forever,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management.Cooling inflation could provide the Federal Reserve greater room to cut interest rates if required. While the Fed has paused rate cuts for now, markets broadly expect easing to resume later this year.Lower borrowing costs could support economic growth and equity markets, though they also carry the risk of reigniting inflation.The broader economic backdrop also appears stronger compared to late 2025, supported by easing inflation and stronger-than-expected job market data last month.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell to 4.06% from 4.09% on Thursday.On Wall Street, stocks of companies previously seen as vulnerable to AI disruption stabilised.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has added several major Chinese companies, including Alibaba and Baidu, to a Pentagon list of firms allegedly supporting China’s military, increasing pressure on Beijing ahead of an expected meeting between leaders of the two countries, according to a Reuters report.The Pentagon’s 1260H list does not directly impose sanctions on the companies. However, under a new US law, the Department of Defense will be barred in the coming years from contracting with or procuring from companies included on the list.Other companies added on Friday include automaker BYD, biotech firm WuXi AppTec and AI-driven robotics company RoboSense Technology Co Ltd. Meanwhile, memory chip maker YMTC was removed from the list.Inclusion in the list also signals to Pentagon suppliers and other US government agencies the military’s assessment of these firms. Some companies listed earlier have challenged their inclusion through legal routes.Responding to the move, an Alibaba spokesperson told Reuters that there was no basis for the inclusion and indicated possible legal action. “Alibaba is not a Chinese military company nor part of any military-civil fusion strategy.”The update to the list could strain ties between Washington and Beijing, particularly after a trade truce agreed between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in October.The list already includes major Chinese firms such as Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL. Tencent had earlier said its business would remain unaffected and that it would seek reconsideration, while CATL said it was “not engaged in any military-related activities”.US lawmakers had earlier urged the Pentagon to expand the list to include several Chinese technology companies, including AI firm DeepSeek, smartphone maker Xiaomi and display manufacturer BOE Technology.Along with YMTC, some firms included last year --such as COSCO SHIPPING Finance Co Ltd and ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc -- have now been removed from the list.","US President Donald Trump has added several major Chinese companies to a Pentagon list of firms allegedly supporting China's military.

UNMISSABLE: Names Of 6 'HIDDEN' Global Figures Finally Released In Unredacted Epstein Files | WATCH

Dubai-based port operator DP World on Friday announced new leadership, replacing long-time chief Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem after documents linked to the Epstein files revealed frequent correspondence between him and the convicted sex offender.""DP World announced the appointment of His Excellency Essa Kazim as Chairman of its Board of Directors and the appointment of Yuvraj Narayan as Group Chief Executive Officer,"" the group said in a statement published by the Dubai media office.The statement did not reference Sulayem.Previously serving as group chairman and chief executive officer of DP World, one of the world’s largest port operators, Sulayem was described by Jeffrey Epstein as one of his “most trusted friends.”He is cited more than 9,400 times in documents recently released by the US Department of Justice, which detail what they describe as close ties between the two men.According to the records, they maintained regular correspondence from 2009 to 2018, exchanging messages on personal matters, meetings, introductions and business opportunities.At the time, Epstein portrayed the wealthy Emirati businessman as being close to Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid.The correspondence also indicates that Sulayem visited Epstein at his residence in the United States on multiple occasions, including trips to his private island.DP World is one of the world’s largest port operators, responsible for a significant share of global container traffic.Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, has long been known for cultivating ties with powerful individuals across sectors. The newly released files underscore that even after his conviction, Epstein continued to connect with influential figures.For example, other reporting on the 2026 release shows Epstein’s role in facilitating meetings between business leaders and politicians, including those linked to UAE-Israel diplomatic backchannels and investment networks.","Long-time DP World chief Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem replaced by Essa Kazim.

"US inflation cools to 2.4% in January, near five-year low as gas and housing costs ease",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-cools-to-2-4-in-january-near-five-year-low-as-gas-and-housing-costs-ease/articleshow/128310871.cms,"A key measure of US inflation fell to nearly a five-year low in January as apartment rental price growth slowed and gas prices declined, offering some relief to consumers after years of sharp cost increases.Inflation dropped to 2.4% in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.7% in December and moving closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, AP reported. Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.5% year-on-year in January, down from 2.6% the previous month and marking the smallest increase since March 2021.The data suggests inflationary pressures could be easing, though it comes after prices of food, fuel and housing surged following the pandemic, leaving overall consumer prices about 25% higher than five years ago. The broad rise in costs has become a major political issue around affordability.On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.2% in January from December, while core prices increased 0.3%.The report may signal cooling inflation, though economists note that prices often rise more in January as companies reset pricing at the start of the year. While gas prices are expected to have declined, grocery costs could see upward pressure after rising in December.Inflation had surged to 9.1% in 2022 amid strong consumer spending and supply chain disruptions following the pandemic. It declined through 2023, stabilised around 3% by mid-2024, and has since improved only gradually.Inflation softened slightly in late 2025, partly reflecting distortions caused by a six-week government shutdown that disrupted data collection, leading to estimates for housing costs that economists said may have artificially lowered inflation readings.At the same time, wage growth has slowed as hiring momentum weakened, reducing workers’ bargaining power. Lower wage growth can ease inflation pressure as businesses face less cost pressure to raise prices.More moderate wage gains are a key reason many economists expect inflation to continue easing this year.“We're not expecting inflation to start up again by any stretch,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust, AP quoted him as saying.Some businesses are still absorbing tariff-related costs, though economists expect companies may raise prices in coming months to offset those expenses. However, most forecasts suggest inflation will decline further by the second half of the year and move closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target by the end of 2026.","Inflation dropped to 2.4% in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.7% in December.

India in talks with China’s Ant International to link UPI with Alipay+ for cross-border payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/india-in-talks-with-chinas-ant-international-to-link-upi-with-alipay-for-cross-border-payments/articleshow/128307429.cms,"Mending India-China ties

India is in discussions with China-related Ant International to allow integration of the digital payments platform Alipay+ with the country’s instant payments system, Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The move could ease cross-border transactions for Indian travellers across merchants that have signed up with Alipay+, Reuters reported, citing two government sources.This would heavily simplify the overseas spending and reduce the costs associated with cross-border payments.Ant International, headquartered in Singapore and founded by China’s Ant Group, now operates independently.According to Reuters, talks between Indian government and central bank officials with the firm indicate a thaw in bilateral economic engagement between New Delhi and Beijing.Alipay+ currently connects about 1.8 billion user accounts with more than 150 million merchants across over 100 markets, including several in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.Meanwhile, UPI has become a cornerstone of India’s fintech infrastructure, handling nearly 18 billion transactions monthly.Indian authorities have been keen to extend UPI’s international reach to enable smoother digital payments in Indian rupees for travellers and overseas Indians.However, final approval for the Alipay+ integration will depend on security evaluations.“There are sensitivities involved in terms of geopolitical positioning or in securing the country’s digital infrastructure and data because of Alipay’s roots in China,” Reuters reported, citing sources.India continues to enforce strict investment regulations for Chinese firms introduced after the 2020 border standoff, and those curbs remain in place.Strained relations between India and China after their 2020 border standoff slowed the flow of capital, technology and talent between the two neighbours, with New Delhi tightening scrutiny of investments by China-based firms or those with China-linked ownership, according to Reuters. The curbs have stalled or delayed several projects, including Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD’s proposed 1 billion dollar investment plan in an India EV venture.In the past year, however, India has begun cautiously rekindling engagement with Beijing as it navigates punishing U.S. tariffs and shifting global trade patterns, officials said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China in 2025 for the first time in seven years and discussed ways to improve ties in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.","India is in discussions with China-related Ant International to allow integration of the digital payments platform Alipay+ with the country’s instant payments system, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) The move could ease cross- border transactions for Indian travellers across merchants that have signed up with the platform.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128307560,imgsize-750127,width-400,resizemode-4/upi-and-alipay-talks.jpg"

'Hegemony Unacceptable, Will Resist': Ramapshosa Denounces Trump Trade Onslaught, Tariff Blackmail

The United States and Taiwan deepened their commercial relations on Thursday, signing a trade deal. Under the agreement, Taiwanese imports to the US will be getting lower tariffs while the island nation has committed to purchase and invest in American products.The step confirms a framework first presented in January. Under that plan, duties applied by Washington on numerous Taiwanese exports are being reduced from 20% to 15%, alongside efforts to bring in more Taiwanese capital into the US technology industry.Before it can take effect, the pact must pass review in Taiwan’s parliament, which is controlled by the opposition. US trade representative Jamieson Greer said the deal ""will eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers facing US exports to Taiwan.""""This agreement also builds on our longstanding economic and trade relationship with Taiwan and will significantly enhance the resilience of our supply chains, particularly in high-technology sectors,"" he added in a statement.Taiwanese vice premier Cheng Li-chiun said that the outcome improves the island’s competitive position, placing it on a ""fair footing to compete with our rivals.""""Compared with our competitor countries, we have even gained a relative advantage, because the gap created by FTAs that previously left us behind has effectively been closed this time,"" Cheng told a press conference in Washington, referring to free trade agreements.He said Taipei had obtained ""Most Favored Nation"" treatment and achieved a reduction in the average charge ""on our exports to the US from an initial 15 percent, without stacking reciprocal tariffs, further down to an average of 12.33 percent.""A fact sheet from the US Trade Representative’s office sets out Taiwan’s intention to drive a ""long-term increase in its purchases of important US goods"" through 2029.Those purchases are expected to cover $44.4 billion in liquefied natural gas and crude oil, $15.2 billion in civil aircraft and engines, and another $25.2 billion spanning power equipment, electricity grids and other items.The document also notes that the United States agreed to ease its tariff levels on Taiwanese products after Taipei committed to taking ""significant steps to advance a stronger and more reciprocal trade relationship.""In addition, Taiwan has undertaken to cut most of its own tariff barriers and open the way for preferential access for American industrial and agricultural exports.","The United States and Taiwan deepened their commercial relations on Thursday, signing a trade deal.

China EXPLODES At Israel's Invasion Bid After Trump & 8 Muslim Nations | 'Not Your TERRITORY'

China has intensified efforts to cement its dominance over rare earth metals as the United States moves to build a broad international coalition to secure critical mineral supply chains, official and media reports said.Chinese Premier Li Qiang this week visited Ganzhou in Jiangxi province — one of the world’s largest heavy rare earth production bases — underscoring Beijing’s strategic focus on the sector that underpins advanced manufacturing and technology. Li inspected key producers, research institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Ganjiang Innovation Academy, and held talks with local business leaders and scientists, according to Chinese state media Xinhua.South China Morning Post quoted Li as saying, “The value of rare earths in boosting advanced manufacturing and green, low‑carbon transformation is increasingly prominent,” highlighting the role of these metals in high-tech and clean-energy industriesChina currently accounts for around 70 % of global rare earth mining and nearly 90 % of processing capacity, giving it substantial leverage in disputes with the United States and other major economies.Beijing’s tightened export controls last year led to disruptions in supply to the US, the EU, India, and other nations, prompting Washington to accelerate efforts to diversify sources of the minerals, which are essential for electronics, automobiles, wind turbines, and defence equipment.According to news agency PTI, China’s restrictions on rare earth supplies previously forced US President Donald Trump to agree to resume shipments to Washington in exchange for tariff concessions and lifting a semiconductor export ban.In response, the Trump administration this month launched a major initiative to form a metallic alliance with more than 50 nations, including India, aimed at securing critical mineral supply chains and reducing reliance on China. As part of this strategy, the US has unveiled a USD 12 billion stockpile plan dubbed “Project Vault” to finance domestic and allied mining and processing.Li also chaired a State Council meeting to push AI-driven innovation, emphasising the integration of data, computing, electricity, network resources, and hardware-software synergy to strengthen China’s technological edge, South China Morning Post reported.",China has intensified efforts to cement its dominance over rare earth metals.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

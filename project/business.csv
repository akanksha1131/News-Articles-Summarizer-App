Gold futures on MCX are trading near ₹1,54,700 after failing to sustain the recent upward momentum.

The short-term structure has turned weak, and rallies toward the resistance band are likely to attract fresh selling pressure.Price is trading below the short-term EMA cluster, with the 8 EMA slipping beneath the 21 EMA, indicating a bearish crossover. The ₹1,55,500 zone aligns with this moving average resistance area, strengthening it as a sell-on-rise level.Gold has moved below the mid-Bollinger band, confirming downside pressure. The lower band near ₹1,53,500–₹1,53,000 could act as the next support zone if selling intensifies.The chart reflects a breakdown from consolidation, followed by sideways movement below resistance. Until price reclaims ₹1,56,500 decisively, the intraday bias remains negative.RSI is at 37.9, below the neutral 50 mark, reflecting weakening momentum and supporting continuation of the downside move.MACD remains in negative territory with the histogram showing bearish expansion, indicating sustained selling momentum.Gold’s intraday technical structure remains weak, supported by bearish EMA alignment, sub-50 RSI reading, and negative MACD momentum.

"Income Tax notice alert! Senior executives with over Rs 50 lakh salaries under radar for ‘underreporting income’, misusing exemptions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/income-tax-notice-alert-senior-executives-with-over-rs-50-lakh-salaries-under-radar-for-underreporting-income-misusing-exemptions/articleshow/128541666.cms,"The Income Tax Department has flagged cases involving non-disclosure of overseas assets and foreign income. (AI image)

Why Income Tax Notices Are Being Sent

Tax notices

Income Tax Notice alert! The Income Tax Department is cracking down on alleged misreporting of income by senior executives across multinational companies and startups. Several such executives earning over Rs 50 lakh have received tax notices from the I-T Department.The tax department has alleged that in all these cases the income has either been underreported, misreported, or false exemptions have been claimed to reduce tax outgo.The Income Tax Department has flagged cases involving non-disclosure of overseas assets and foreign income, understatement of stock-based compensation, and inflated claims of benefits such as accommodation and travel allowances aimed at lowering taxable income.According to officials quoted in an ET report, the Income Tax Department authorities have issued notices to these individuals — including chief executives and managing directors at multinational corporations — asking them to correct discrepancies in their filings before any action is taken.Executives from industries including, information technology, fast-moving consumer goods, hospitality, engineering and construction, and automobiles have received such notices.Officials cited in the report said that several founders and senior leaders from startups have also attracted the tax department’s scrutiny.In many instances, the taxpayers are alleged to have sought tax relief by reporting bogus donations to religious bodies, charitable organisations, or educational institutions.We are examining more than two dozen cases involving investments in high-value properties, over 50 instances where substantial secondary income was received from foreign clients in cryptocurrencies, and cases featuring significant contributions to political parties that are neither officially recognised nor participating in elections, a senior official was quoted as saying.These irregularities came to light following closer scrutiny of income tax returns filed by high earners during the ongoing assessment period. Under its ‘Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable (Nudge)’ initiative, the department has prompted several executives to submit revised returns to address inconsistencies.An official noted that some taxpayers assumed overseas acquisitions and holdings would escape detection. However, with the government getting important financial information through automated data-sharing arrangements and monitoring linked to the Permanent Account Number (PAN), concealing such foreign dealings has become far more challenging.Among the undeclared assets that have been identified are properties registered in the names of spouses and minor children, foreign equity investments, cryptocurrency-based income, and funds maintained in overseas bank accounts.The review also revealed a striking trend: many taxpayers represented by the same chartered accountants were contributing to identical institutions. The official added that separate proceedings are being initiated against those chartered accountants.This enforcement drive is part of the government’s wider effort to strengthen compliance through data-centric oversight. In recent years, authorities have increasingly relied on artificial intelligence-powered analytics to detect mismatches between reported income, tax deducted at source records, and information obtained from third-party financial sources.So far in the current financial year, over 2.1 million taxpayers have revised their returns for assessment years 2021-22 through 2024-25, resulting in additional tax payments exceeding Rs 2,500 crore. Additionally, more than 1.5 million returns have already been updated for the ongoing assessment year.In the 2026-27 Budget, the Centre introduced a one-time six-month compliance window allowing individuals to disclose foreign assets. The measure is intended to offer relief to taxpayers, including professionals with unreported employee stock option holdings and students who continued to hold funds in overseas accounts.","Executives from industries including, information technology, fast-moving consumer goods, hospitality, engineering and construction, and automobiles have received such notices.

The index formed a sizable bearish candle on the daily chart and slipped below the lower boundary of the 25,500–26,000 consolidation range, indicating a decisive loss of short-term momentum. The sharp decline has brought Nifty close to its previous swing low, thereby shifting the near-term bias to cautious and signalling the need for stability at lower levels.Technically, the index has broken below both the 50Day EMA and the 21day EMA in a single move, reflecting strong selling pressure.The 200-day EMA, placed near 25,200, is now the next crucial short term support zone and appears vulnerable if follow-up selling persists in the coming sessions.On the downside, immediate supports are seen at 25,350 and 25,000, which may act as key cushions in case of further weakness.On the upside, resistance is placed at 25,650, followed by 25,720, where any pullback is likely to face selling pressure.The index surrendered most of the gains from the previous two sessions and formed a large bearish engulfing candle on the daily chart, indicating strong profit booking near all-time high levels.It witnessed sharp selling from the highs and eventually closed near the day’s low, reflecting sustained weakness throughout the session.The 21-day EMA, placed around 60,300, emerges as the key level to watch, as the index has found support near this average on multiple prior occasions. Immediate support is seen at 60,300, followed by 60,000.On the upside, near-term resistance is positioned at 61,500 and 61,750. In the near term, the index is likely to trade within a broad range of 60,000–61,500, and a decisive breakout on either side could trigger fresh directional momentum.On the weekly chart, IndusInd Bank shows a steady recovery after a prolonged downtrend, with price holding above the 21 EMA, indicating improving momentum.The stock appears to be forming a rounding base and is now consolidating near the 900–950 zone after a gradual up move.The rising 21 EMA is acting as immediate support, while RSI near the 50–60 range reflects neutral-to-positive strength.Immediate resistance is placed at 950–980 followed by 1060 which is 200 weeks EMA. On the downside, supports are seen at 880–860.UPL has displayed strong bullish momentum on the daily chart, forming a positive candle while sustaining a clear pattern of higher highs and higher lows, indicating a strengthening upward trend. The stock has also delivered a swing breakout supported by a noticeable rise in trading volumes, reflecting improving buying participation and reinforcing the positive price structure. Also It has started to move above its 21 weeks EMA indicating short term positive bias.Technically, the breakout offers a favorable risk–reward opportunity on the long side. As long as the stock sustains above key support levels, momentum is likely to remain intact. Going ahead, the stock is expected to move towards the ₹830 mark, which coincides with its previous all-time high and acts as the next major resistance zone. A strict stop loss should be maintained near ₹728 to manage downside risk.","Bajaj Broking Research shares its view on Nifty and Bank Nifty.

Nothing changes for India: Trump

NEW DELHI: India will pay a 10 per cent tariff ""until another authority is invoked,” the White House said on Friday, after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10 per cent tariff on imports from all countries, news agency ANI reported.This comes after the US Supreme Court delivered a stunning rebuke to President Donald Trump, ruling in a 6–3 decision that his global tariffs are illegal.When asked whether India will have to pay a 10 per cent tariff and whether it would replace previous tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a White House official said, “Yes, 10% until another authority is invoked.”The official also advised all trade partners to abide by their trade deals. The new 10% global tariff is part of Trump’s protectionist trade agenda, aimed at addressing balance-of-payments issues and unfair trade practices.Following the major legal defeat at the US Supreme Court, US President Donald Trump announced a 10 per cent global tariff “effective immediately.”“Effective immediately, all the national security tariffs under Section 232 and existing Section 301 tariffs remain in place… Today, I will sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122 over and above our normal tariffs already being charged,” Trump said.Terming SC's ruling as a ""terrible decision"", Trump announced he would sign an executive order for a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. This authority allows for a temporary import surcharge (up to 15%) for 150 days to address balance-of-payments deficits.""Effective immediately, all the national security tariffs under Section 232 and existing Section 301 tariffs remain in place...

I think Prime Minister Modi is a great gentleman, a great man, actually, but he was much smarter than the people that he was against in terms of the United States. He was ripping us off, India. So we made a deal with India, it's a fair deal now, and we are not paying tariffs to them and they are paying tariffs.

Court blocks sweeping tariffs

Trump targets justices, including his own appointees

Defiant tone, new tariffs announced

Markets and global trade face renewed uncertainty

In a sharp rebuke to his trade agenda, US President Donald Trump lashed out at the Supreme Court of the United States on Friday after it struck down his sweeping global tariffs, calling the decision “ridiculous” and accusing some justices of undermining the country’s economic interests.In a strongly worded response, Trump said those members of the court who voted against what he described as a “very acceptable and proper method of tariffs should be ashamed of themselves,” adding that he would pursue alternative measures to impose new duties.The Supreme Court, in a 6–3 ruling written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr, held that Trump had exceeded his legal authority when he imposed tariffs on nearly all US trading partners last year. The decision dealt a major blow to a cornerstone of Trump’s economic and trade policy, which relied heavily on tariffs to pressure foreign governments and reshape global supply chains.The majority found that the president’s use of emergency powers to justify the tariffs went beyond what Congress had authorized, effectively invalidating the broad measures that had targeted dozens of countries.Lashing out at the decision, the US president added in his series of Truth Social posts, ""To show you how ridiculous the opinion is, the Court said that I’m not allowed to charge even $1 DOLLAR to any Country under IEEPA, I assume to protect other Countries, not the United States which they should be interested in protecting — But I am allowed to cut off any and all Trade or Business with that same Country, even imposing a Foreign Country destroying embargo, and do anything else I want to do to them — How nonsensical is that? They are saying that I have the absolute right to license, but not the right to charge a license fee.What license has ever been issued without the right to charge a fee? But now the Court has given me the unquestioned right to ban all sorts of things from coming into our Country, a much more powerful Right than many people thought we had.""Read more: Trump reacts to US Supreme Court verdict invalidating his tariffs Trump singled out two justices he had appointed, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, expressing frustration that they ruled against him despite his nomination.“What happened today with the two justices that I appointed against great opposition… never seems to happen with Democrats,” Trump said.He also criticised Chief Justice Roberts, accusing him of leading an effort that would allow foreign countries to continue “ripping us off,” while praising dissenting justices including Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh for what he called their “strength, wisdom, and love of our country.”Further doubling on tariffs, Trump said, ""In actuality, while I am sure they did not mean to do so, the Supreme Court’s decision today made a President’s ability to both regulate Trade, and impose TARIFFS, more powerful and crystal clear, rather than less. There will no longer be any doubt, and the Income coming in, and the protection of our Companies and Country, will actually increase because of this decision. Based on longstanding Law and Hundreds of Victories to the contrary, the Supreme Court did not overrule TARIFFS, they merely overruled a particular use of IEEPA TARIFFS. The ability to block, embargo, restrict, license, or impose any other condition on a Foreign Country’s ability to conduct Trade with the United States under IEEPA, has been fully confirmed by this decision. In order to protect our Country, a President can actually charge more TARIFFS than I was charging in the past under the various other TARIFF authorities, which have also been confirmed, and fully allowed.""Also read: Why US Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump's trade tariffs; explained in 10 points Despite the setback, Trump struck a defiant tone, insisting his administration would move forward with new tariffs using alternative legal authorities. Within hours of the ruling, he announced plans to impose a fresh across-the-board 10 per cent tariff, signaling his intent to continue using trade measures as a central tool of economic policy.""Those members of the Supreme Court who voted against our very acceptable and proper method of TARIFFS should be ashamed of themselves. Their decision was ridiculous but, now the adjustment process begins, and we will do everything possible to take in even more money than we were taking in before!"" said Trump.Trump described tariffs as vital to national security and economic strength, claiming they had helped boost markets, reduce illicit drug flows, and pressure foreign governments.He also took digs at Democrats saying, ""The Democrats on the Court are thrilled, but they will automatically vote “NO” against ANYTHING that makes America Strong and Healthy Again. They, also, are a Disgrace to our Nation. Others think they’re being “politically correct,” which has happened before, far too often, with certain Members of this Court when, in fact, they’re just FOOLS and “LAPDOGS” for the RINOS and Radical Left Democrats and, not that this should have anything to do with it, very unpatriotic, and disloyal to the Constitution. It is my opinion that the Court has been swayed by Foreign Interests, and a Political Movement that is far smaller than people would think — But obnoxious, ignorant, and loud!""The ruling and Trump’s swift response injected fresh uncertainty into global markets and trade relations. Businesses and trading partners now face questions about the scope and legality of future US tariff actions, as well as the broader direction of American trade policy under Trump’s leadership.While the court’s decision represents a significant legal constraint on presidential tariff powers, Trump made clear that his administration would explore “methods, practices, statutes, and other authorities” to continue imposing trade barriers.The confrontation marks one of the most direct clashes between Trump and the Supreme Court, underscoring the high stakes surrounding tariffs and executive power in shaping US economic strategy.","US President Donald Trump lashes out at the Supreme Court of the United States after it struck down his sweeping global tariffs.

'Modi Is A Great...': Trump’s HUGE UPDATE On India-US Trade Deal Amid ‘Tariff War’ With SCOTUS

New Delhi: Domestic industry and experts saw some relief in the US Supreme Court striking down Trump's tariffs and argued that it may help India negotiate a better deal.While US President Donald Trump had imposed 50% tariffs on Indian exports, the 25% penal tariffs have been done away with. With the interim agreement finalised, the US is to lower the additional levy to 18%.While Indian industry was seeing signs of relief following the US Supreme court order. Saurabh Agarwal, tax partner at EY India said the ""judicial correction"" strengthens India's negotiating hand. ""We see this as a net positive; it allows India to double down on its manufacturing momentum, without the immediate threat of arbitrary trade barriers. Our focus remains on transitioning this into a comprehensive Bilateral Trade Agreement that honours reciprocal market access, while safeguarding India's strategic domestic priorities. However, duties under section 232 still continue impacting sectors such as steel, alumunium, automobiles.""Trade research body GTRI said the ruling should prompt India to re-examine its trade deal with the US. ""The decision effectively renders recent trade deals initiated or concluded by the US with the UK, Japan, the EU, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and India one-sided and useless.Partner countries may now find reasons to dump these deals,"" it said.""This ruling against Trump would reassert Congress's primacy in trade policy, sharply curbing presidential latitude to weaponise tariffs and reshaping how future administrations wield emergency economic powers,"" it added.While the order has raised hopes of exporters getting refunds, the court did not make any such observation. The case will now go back to the Court of International Trade to sort through the refunds.","US President Donald Trump had imposed 50% tariffs on Indian exports.

Embraer seeks 200 jet orders to make in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/embraer-seeks-200-jet-orders-to-make-in-india/articleshow/128630551.cms,"Embraer

To meet Air India, IndiGo execs

New Delhi: Getting ""firm orders for 200 plus"" aircraft from Indian carriers is the key to Embraer setting up a final assembly line (FAL) in the country for commercial fixed-wing aircraft. And if hitting the double century takes a while, a start could be made with a ""completion centre"" where ordered aircraft will fly in from Brazil; be painted, fitted with seats and other interior work before being delivered to local customers.In India for the first time after the Brazilian aerospace major signed an MoU with Adani Group last month to set up a FAL for its popular regional jets, Embraer president & CEO Francisco Gomes Neto shared the details for his plans for the country.""Being the fastest growing aviation market globally, a big economy, expanding airport network and PM Modi's successful UDAN scheme giving a filip to regional flights, India will need at least 500 regional jets in coming years. As far as Embraer goes, we need a firm order of 200 jets for the FAL here to be viable and feasible. The same can come up in 24 months of starting work. So if we get the orders this year, the FAL will be ready to roll out jets in 2028,"" Francisco Gomes Neto told TOI.In his pursuit for orders, he will be meeting decision-makers at leading Indian aviation players including Tata Group's Air India Friday. A meeting with IndiGo is on the cards in coming days. In India, Embraer is looking at assembling its 76-88 seater E175 regional jet which are used for short to medium-haul flights. There are at present eight E175 with Star Air and one in Reliance Industries fleet. Partner Adani group is scouting for sites, with Dholera in Gujarat being the frontrunner.""For the last one-and-a-half years we are working on having a supplier base in India to buy parts for the jets coming out of our Brazilian FAL. Most recently, we have signed an MoU with Hindalco to identify possibilities in aerospace grade aluminium raw material manufacturing to strengthen our commitment to 'make in India'. As of now we have over 15 supply chain partners in India,"" said Gomes Neto, who has been heading Embraer since May 2019.At present Embraer has FALs only in Brazil (for defence and commercial jets) and the US (for business jets). Apart from them, it manufactures some parts in Portugal. ""We are coming to India primarily to serve the Indian market. Once we are here (meaning the FAL is set up), we will look to meet the requirement of nearby markets from India. Expanding production capacity is in our interest and given India's potential, expecting firm orders for 200 jets is very reasonable,"" he said. The company is planning the entire ecosystem in India, including an maintenance, repair and overhaul, pilot training and full flight simulator.Embraer has taken the same route in the defence space too. It plans to establish a MRO capability in India for the C-390 Millennium ""upon selection in the Indian Air Force's medium transport aircraft"" programme.","Embraer is looking at assembling its 76-88 seater E175 regional jet which are used for short to medium-haul flights.

New Delhi: The impact of AI on the labour market will be like a ""tsunami"" and can create havoc in financial markets, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said on Friday, while estimating that it can lift global growth by 0.8%.The IMF managing director estimated that nearly 40% of jobs in emerging markets and 60% in developed economies may be impacted by AI.""It will eliminate some jobs while enhancing others, and we have no idea how to help people find their place in the AI economy. There should be mindful efforts to manage the transition,"" she said.Georgieva also cautioned that AI could widen inequality between individuals and countries, with some benefiting significantly while others are left behind. ""If AI gets loose, it can create havoc in financial markets. But on balance, my appeal to all of us is to embrace the opportunities, be mindful of the risks, and manage them,"" she said.While being optimistic about the tech, Georgieva cautioned against ""sugarcoating"" the impact of AI and called for striking a balance between building and managing AI as a 'force for good or evil'.On the positive side, she said: ""AI can lift global growth by almost a percentage point.It will mean that the world will grow faster than it did before the Covid pandemic. And that is fantastic for creating more opportunities, more jobs. This is the magnitude that we see for India, and it would mean that India's Viksit Bharat is achievable.""She said AI creates potential for countries that go fast on digital infrastructure, skills, and adoption of AI, and countries must embrace the opportunities, while being mindful of the risks.Georgieva identified three risks: making countries and world less fair (for tech haves and have nots), financial stability as it may impact markets and displacement of jobs.Even earlier, IMF had cautioned on AI, arguing that some of the US investments boom in AI may turn out to be a bubble, like the dot-com bust at the start of the millennium.","IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva says AI can lift global growth by 0.8%.

Beyond Oil: How India & US Are Securing the Future of AI Chips

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday held a roundtable with deeptech startups and underscored the govt's push to expand AI adoption with strong data governance, human oversight and India-focused innovation - particularly across healthcare, education and citizen services.The roundtable brought together founders and CEOs from 16 deeptech startups, including Adalat AI, BrainSightAI, Rubrik, SatSure, Credo AI, Eka Care, Glean, Innogle, Invideo, Miko, Origin, Rasen, Supernova and Sypha AI.It came amid the PM's hectic schedule Friday that included seven bilateral meetings, including with the leaders of Liechtenstein, Slovak Republic, Sri Lanka and Mauritius, apart from discussions with UN secretary general Antonio Guterres, Open AI CEO Sam Altman and Qualcomm boss Cristiano Amon.Emphasising that fairness, transparency and meaningful human oversight must remain non-negotiable in the design and deployment of AI, PM Modi echoed principles that align closely with Adalat AI's philosophy, said Arghya Bhattacharya, co-founder of the company, which is building India's end-to-end justice tech stack to reduce delays, streamline workflows, and improve access.Bipul Sinha, cofounder and CEO of US-based cybersecurity firm Rubrik, said the roundtable underscored Modi's vision for India's digital future and highlighted the potential to deploy AI at scale in sectors such as agritech, healthcare and education.""He has a granular view of the areas where AI can make a real impact and difference - from space tech to agriculture.""""PM was very buoyant about India's deeptech ecosystem.

MUMBAI: Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar on Thursday met Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde at his official residence, Nandanvan, in Mumbai, to extend an invitation for the wedding of his son, Arjun Tendulkar.During the meeting, Tendulkar, accompanied by his wife Anjali, and the deputy chief minister also discussed various matters, with a particular focus on sports-related issues.On Wednesday, Tendulkar, along with Anjali Tendulkar, had met Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to invite him to their son Arjun's wedding with Saaniya Chandhok.Sachin Tendulkar has also extended invitations to President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi for the wedding ceremony of Arjun Tendulkar and Saaniya Chandhok.Arjun Tendulkar and Saaniya got engaged in August last year.The 26-year-old Arjun has played five Indian Premier League (IPL) matches for the Mumbai Indians (MI), taking three wickets while conceding 114 runs. He has also scored 13 runs in his IPL career so far. In domestic cricket, he currently represents Goa, having made his Mumbai debut in 2021.Ahead of the IPL 2026 mini-auction, Arjun was traded from the Mumbai Indians to the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) and is set to represent LSG this season.While MI parted ways with Arjun, they secured leg-spinner Mayank Markande in a trade with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).Arjun was initially picked up by the Mumbai Indians in the IPL 2021 mini-auction for ₹20 lakh but did not feature in any matches that season.MI bought him again for Rs 30 lakh in the IPL 2022 mega-auction, and he made his long-awaited IPL debut in 2023, taking three wickets in four games. Ahead of IPL 2024, Hardik Pandya replaced Rohit Sharma as MI captain, and Arjun appeared in only one match that season.In the IPL 2025 mega-auction, Arjun went unsold in the initial round but was later acquired by MI at his base price of Rs 30 lakh in the accelerated round. He did not get a game that season and remained on the bench.Saaniya Chandhok hails from a prominent family background. She is the granddaughter of Ravi Ghai, Chairman of the Graviss Group. She has also been a close friend of the Tendulkar family, particularly Arjun's sister Sara Tendulkar, for several years.","Sachin Tendulkar meets Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde at his official residence, Nandanvan, in Mumbai.

Warren Buffett's company invests in The New York Times 6 years after he sold all his newspapers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffetts-company-invests-in-the-new-york-times-6-years-after-he-sold-all-his-newspapers/articleshow/128631977.cms,".

OMAHA: Six years after Warren Buffett sold off all of Berkshire Hathaway's newspapers and predicted unending declines for most of the industry, Berkshire disclosed a new $350 million investment in The New York Times on Tuesday.The somewhat surprising move highlighted the quarterly update Berkshire filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission about the company's stock holdings in Buffett's last quarter as CEO. Berkshire also increased its investment in Chevron just before President Donald Trump ordered the arrest of Venezuela's president, and the Omaha-based company continued selling off more of its Bank of America and Apple shares.At the time Buffett sold off Berkshire's dozens of newspapers in 2020 he concluded the industry was ""toast."" But even then he suggested that newspapers with a national brand like the Times or The Wall Street Journal might still do well.""It's a full circle moment for Berkshire Hathaway in reinvesting in news and a huge vote of confidence by Berkshire in the business strategy of The New York Times,"" said Tim Franklin, a professor and chair of local news at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism.Franklin said the Times may have its roots in the newspaper business, but today it's a thriving digital business with popular games like Wordle, a well-known sports platform called The Athletic and more than 12 million digital subscribers. He said maybe struggling local newspapers can draw some lessons from the ""digital news powerhouse"" the Times has become and find ways to offer online games and showcase the local sports coverage that readers can't get elsewhere.These quarterly stock portfolio filings don't make clear whether Buffett made every move or whether one of Berkshire's other investment managers did. Buffett generally handled any investments worth more than $1 billion, so at the size of this Times investment it's not certain whether this was one of his bets.But many investors will still try to copy it because of Buffett's remarkable track record over the decades before he handed the CEO title over to Greg Abel in January after six decades of leading Berkshire. Shares of the Times jumped nearly 3% in after hours trading after Berkshire disclosed the stake.Berkshire also picked up about 8 million more Chevron shares in the quarter to give it more than 130 million shares in the oil giant. That was a particularly well-timed bet because Chevron's stock has soared since Trump promised to reinvigorate Venezuela's oil business, but Buffett has long been bullish about the oil business and Berkshire has been a major investor in Chevron and Occidental Petroleum for several years.Chevron is the only major American oil company with significant operations in Venezuela, where it produces about 250,000 barrels a day. Chevron, which first invested in Venezuela in the 1920s, does business in the country through joint ventures with the state-owned company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, commonly known as PDVSA. Chevron's stock is up nearly 19% since the start of 2026 just before the US captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in a raidThe other notable moves Berkshire made in the last three months of 2025 included selling off roughly 50 million Bank of America shares although it still holds nearly 81 million shares of the bank that he first started buying in 2011 while Bank of America was struggling with the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis. And Berkshire trimmed about 10 million shares off its massive Apple stake but continued to hold nearly 228 million shares at the end of last year.In addition to stocks, Berkshire owns dozens of companies outright including insurance giants like Geico, a collection of major utilities, BNSF railroad and many manufacturing and retail companies with brands like Dairy Queen and See's Candy.",Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new $350 million investment in The New York Times on Tuesday.

US President Donald Trump has announced to have imposed a global tariff of 10% on all international imports into the United States. This comes the US Supreme Court struck down his sweeping and often arbitrary duties, delivering a stinging rebuke of his signature economic policy.Announcing the move on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump said the order would be “effective almost immediately.”He wrote, ""It is my Great Honor to have just signed, from the Oval Office, a Global 10% Tariff on all Countries, which will be effective almost immediately.""Expressing his displeasure with the Supreme Court's order, he ridiculed the decision, stating he shall begin the ""adjustment process"" and will be incorporating measures to ""take in more money than before.""On his Truth Social, he wrote, ""Those members of the Supreme Court who voted against our very acceptable and proper method of TARIFFS should be ashamed of themselves. Their decision was ridiculous but, now the adjustment process begins, and we will do everything possible to take in even more money than we were taking in before!""Earlier, while outlining his decision, Trump cited Section 122 and said he would also initiate investigations under Section 301 of the US Trade Act, which allows tariffs in response to unfair foreign trade practices.Speaking at a press conference, he said, ""Today, I will sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122, over and above our normal tariffs already being charged, and we're also initiating several Section 301 and other investigations to protect our country from unfair trading practices.""The new tariff is set to take effect on February 24 and will remain in place for 150 days. Exemptions will continue for sectors currently under separate investigations, including pharmaceuticals, as well as for goods entering the US under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, according to a White House factsheet.Trump’s latest move follows a year in which he imposed varying tariff rates to pressure and penalise countries, both allies and adversaries.However, the conservative-majority Supreme Court ruled 6–3 on Friday that a 1977 law Trump had relied on to impose sudden tariffs on individual countries, reshaping global trade flows, “does not authorise the President to impose tariffs.” Notably, Trump had nominated two of the justices who joined the majority opinion against him.Reacting angrily to the ruling, Trump alleged, without providing evidence, that the court had been influenced by foreign interests. ""I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed, for not having the courage to do what's right for our country,"" Trump told reporters.He further insisted that the judgment had, in fact, strengthened his authority. ""In order to protect our country, a president can actually charge more tariffs than I was charging in the past,"" Trump said, adding that the ruling left him ""more powerful.""Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking at the Economic Club of Dallas, defended the alternative approach, saying it ""will result in virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026.""",US President Donald Trump has imposed a global tariff of 10% on all international imports into the United States.

‘Historic Embarrassment’ For Trump; US Supreme Court Blocks Global Tariffs In Shock Ruling

Why the court struck down Trump tariffs





1. The emergency law does not mention tariffs



2. No president had used IEEPA this way before



3. Tariffs are different from other emergency tools



4. Government reading would give sweeping power



5. Majority relied on the major questions doctrine



6. All six majority justices agreed on the core point



7. Roberts’ central conclusion



8. Some justices noted other tools exist in the law



9. Tariffs had broad economic effects



10. Decision creates legal and practical fallout



The US Supreme Court on Friday struck down many tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, ruling that a key emergency law he relied on does not give presidents the authority to impose such duties. The 6–3 decision was a major defeat for Trump and a relatively rare instance of the court checking his efforts in a second term that has relied heavily on tariffs as economic and foreign policy leverage against both allies and adversaries.The majority coalition brought together Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.At the center of the case was the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 statute that allows the president to regulate imports to address national security, foreign policy or economic threats. Trump had invoked the law to justify sweeping tariffs on nearly every country, citing “large and persistent” trade deficits and failures by China, Canada and Mexico to stem the flow of illicit fentanyl and other drugs into the United States.The court, however, concluded the law does not authorize tariffs.The ruling has wide economic and political implications. It raises the prospect that the administration may have to refund more than $100 billion in tariff revenue to importers and leaves unresolved how businesses or consumers affected by higher prices could be compensated. Trump reacted angrily and quickly moved to impose new tariffs under different laws, including the 1974 Trade Act, signaling the fight over presidential tariff powers is likely to continue.Also read | Nothing changes for India: Donald Trump's big statement on trade deal Trump also said the court decision would not affect the ongoing India–US trade deal. Speaking after announcing a new 10% global tariff, he said the arrangement with India would remain unchanged and that New Delhi would continue paying tariffs while the United States would not.“Nothing changes, they'll be paying tariffs, and we will not be paying tariffs. So, the deal with India is they pay tariffs. This is a reversal for what it used to be. I think Prime Minister Modi is a great gentleman, a great man, actually, but he was much smarter than the people that he was against in terms of the United States. He was ripping us off, India. So we made a deal with India, it's a fair deal now, and we are not paying tariffs to them and they are paying tariffs. We did a little flip,"" said Trump.IEEPA authorises the president to “regulate … importation” to address unusual and extraordinary threats to national security, foreign policy or the economy. But the statute does not use the words tariff, duty, levy or tax, which the court said was significant.The majority stressed that before Donald Trump, presidents had not understood IEEPA to allow tariffs. That history supported the view that Congress never granted such power in the law.The court said tariffs differ from actions like quotas or embargoes because they “operate directly on domestic importers to raise revenue for the Treasury,” placing them outside the statute’s intended scope.Under the administration’s interpretation, the court said, a president could impose duties “of unlimited amount and duration, on any product from any country,” a level of authority the justices said Congress had not clearly granted.Three conservative justices in the majority — Roberts, Gorsuch and Barrett — applied the principle that major economic or political powers claimed by the executive must be clearly authorised by Congress.Despite differences in reasoning, all six concluded that IEEPA is silent on tariff authority and historically was not understood to include it.Chief Justice John Roberts wrote: “Our task today is to decide only whether the power to ‘regulate … importation,’ as granted to the president in IEEPA, embraces the power to impose tariffs. It does not.”The opinion said IEEPA allows measures such as quotas or embargoes on imports during emergencies, but that does not mean tariffs — a separate and revenue-raising instrument — are included.The struck-down tariffs had pushed up prices of imported goods including furniture, apparel and electronics. Economists said prices may not fall quickly because Trump is already pursuing replacement tariffs and companies may keep prices high amid uncertainty.The ruling opens the door to possible refunds of more than $100 billion in tariff revenue to importers, with lower courts, the US Court of International Trade, Customs and Border Protection and the Treasury Department expected to oversee the process. Importers are directly eligible, while other businesses may seek reimbursement through lawsuits; compensation for consumers is unclear.Within hours of the decision, Trump announced he would impose a new 10% tariff on all imports starting February 24 by invoking Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, a provision no president had previously used, and said he would pursue further tariffs through Section 301 investigations into other countries’ trade practices.","The US Supreme Court on Friday struck down many tariffs imposed by Donald Trump.

MEA Clears India's Position On Russian Oil After US Envoy Conveys Trump's Wish On Venezuelan Oil

New Delhi: Crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia have hit their highest levels since Nov 2019, clocking nearly 1-1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in Feb, and overtaking Russia temporarily to emerge as the biggest supplier to India.According to data shared by Kpler, a global data and analytics service provider, crude imports from the West Asian country peaked at 1.3 million barrels on Feb 20 (Friday), eclipsing Russian supplies of about 1.1 mbd. Saudi Arabia has consistently held the third or fourth position in India's crude import basket over the past couple of years, with Russia remaining on top and Iraq and the UAE occupying the other two spots.The recent surge has significantly narrowed the gap between Riyadh and Moscow that widened after India ramped up Russian oil purchases following the Ukraine invasion. The numbers come amid mounting pressure from the US to reduce Russian crude purchases.""We expect some moderation in the coming weeks, with a few parcels likely slipping into early March. On a full-month basis, our predictive flows model currently indicates Saudi imports averaging closer to 1-1.1 mbd in Feb, still a multi-year high,"" said Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst at Kpler.He said Russian crude imports are expected to be 1-1.2 mbd in Feb and may fall to 0.8-1 mbd a day in next month. ""However, we continue to see this as a short-term stabilisation. .. we expect Russia's share in India's crude slate to gradually stabilise at a lower range in 2026 compared to 2024 and 2025 as commercial and policy frictions build,"" he said. The analyst added Russian imports are expected to dip further in April as Nayara's Vadinar refinery, heavily dependent on Russian crude following EU sanctions, is scheduled for maintenance in April-May.","Crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia have hit their highest levels since Nov 2019, clocking nearly 1-1.1 million barrels per day in Feb.

Tariffs that remain unaffected



The US Supreme Court on Friday struck down a series of sweeping tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, ruling that he exceeded his authority under emergency economic powers. However, the decision does not affect several sector-specific duties that remain in place.In a 6-3 ruling, the conservative-majority court held that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) ""does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.""In its judgment, the court said, ""The United States, after all, is not at war with every nation in the world. The Government instead relies exclusively on IEEPA. It reads the words 'regulate' and 'importation’ to effect a sweeping delegation of Congress's power to set tariff policy—authorizing the President to impose tariffs of unlimited amount and duration, on any product from any country.""The bench added that ""had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs"" through IEEPA, ""it would have done so expressly, as it consistently has in other tariff statutes.""Chief Justice John Roberts, delivering the opinion, noted that ""IEEPA contains no reference to tariffs or duties.""The ruling centres on Trump’s use of the 1977 IEEPA law, which allows the president to ""regulate"" trade in response to a declared national emergency.Trump first invoked the law in February 2025 to impose tariffs on goods from China, Mexico and Canada, citing drug trafficking as an emergency.In April, he used the same law to introduce ""reciprocal"" tariffs ranging from 10% to 50% on imports from nearly all US trading partners, arguing that the US trade deficit posed an ""extraordinary and unusual threat.""A lower trade court had ruled in May that Trump overstepped his authority with the across-the-board levies and blocked most of them, though the decision had been paused pending appeal.The Supreme Court’s ruling upholds that earlier decision, effectively invalidating the country-wide tariffs imposed under IEEPA.The judgment does not impact industry-specific tariffs imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which were justified on national security grounds.These include duties on steel, aluminium, lumber and automotive imports. Several government investigations that could lead to additional sectoral tariffs are still underway.Economists say the ruling could significantly reduce the overall US tariff burden. EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco had told AFP ahead of the decision that striking down the emergency tariffs would likely lower the average US tariff rate from 16.8% to around 9.5%.However, he cautioned that the relief may be temporary if the administration seeks alternative legal avenues to reimpose broad duties.Financial markets reacted positively to the verdict. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 207.03 points, or 0.42%, to 49,602.19, while the S&P 500 gained 33.44 points, or 0.52%, to 6,895.33 shortly after the announcement.","The US Supreme Court on Friday struck down a series of sweeping tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.

‘Disgrace’: Trump Screams, Cuts Short State Governors’ Event After US SC Tariff Ruling

What does the ruling mean? We take a look:

Lower tariff burden: At least for the moment!

Hit to Trump government revenues

Reduced room to maneuver

Alternative routes

The Supreme Court has dealt a blow to US President Donald Trump ’s favourite economic agenda - tariffs, to the extent that the US President has called the ruling a ‘disgrace’. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs have been called illegal by the apex court,The Supreme Court of the United States on Friday said that President Donald Trump exceeded his legal authority by invoking emergency economic powers to levy tariffs — a rare reprimand that delivers a significant setback to his economic program.With certain levies imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) deemed unlawful, the overall US tariff rate is expected to decline, at least in the near term, reports AFP.According to The Budget Lab at Yale University, doing away with the IEEPA-based tariffs would bring the average effective tariff rate down to 9.1 percent — still the highest level seen since 1946, excluding 2025. Had those emergency-based tariffs remained in place, the rate would have stood at 16.9 percent.Analysts suggest that even if the Trump administration moves to reimpose similar trade barriers under alternative statutes, the resulting tariff levels would probably be lower than those previously enforced.Also Read | Why were Trump tariffs ruled illegal by Supreme Court? Top points from what SC said in its ruling Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said the ruling compels a recalibration of trade policy that could ultimately result in reduced tariff levels and a more structured approach to introducing future duties.Oliver Allen of Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that the tariffs appear to have weighed on Trump’s approval ratings, while voter dissatisfaction over elevated prices continues to be a politically sensitive issue ahead of the November midterm elections.Economists anticipate the decision will also dent federal revenues. Estimates suggest that tariffs enacted under IEEPA generated between $130 billion and $140 billion by the close of 2025.ING analysts Carsten Brzeski and Julian Geib observed that the issue of potential reimbursements remains unresolved and will be addressed by lower courts in the months ahead.They emphasized that refunds would not be automatic; companies seeking repayment would need to pursue legal action. That process is already underway, with more than 1,000 corporate entities reportedly engaged in litigation.Should the government ultimately be required to return collected duties, it could face an additional fiscal strain.Also Read | Trump tariffs struck down by US Supreme Court: What it means for India - 55% exports to America free from 18% duty A key worry is that Trump may forfeit some of the “flexibility” to deploy tariffs on national security grounds or as bargaining tools in trade talks — a concern previously flagged by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.Even so, he has argued that the administration retains the ability to rely on tariffs as a source of government revenue.Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said invalidating tariffs imposed under emergency authority would limit the president’s capacity to introduce sweeping duties at will.However, Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, suggested that US trading partners are unlikely to abandon recently concluded tariff arrangements. In her view, they understand that withdrawing could ultimately leave them in a weaker position in dealings with the White House.Also Read | 'US not at war with every nation': Supreme Court's sharp put down in ruling against Trump's illegal tariffs Despite the setback, President Donald Trump has other legal mechanisms available to reinstate trade barriers, and analysts anticipate he may pursue them.Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 permits the president to respond to balance-of-payments concerns by introducing temporary import duties of up to 15 percent.In addition, Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 authorizes the imposition of tariffs as high as 50 percent on nations deemed to be engaging in discriminatory trade conduct.Another established tool is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which has already been used repeatedly to levy sector-specific tariffs that were not affected by Friday’s decision.Likewise, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 — employed during Trump’s first term to target imports from China — remains an option, though it requires a formal investigation process similar to Section 232.Earlier this year, Trump told The New York Times that he could also consider restructuring the tariffs as licensing fees.",The Supreme Court has dealt a blow to US President Donald Trump ’s favourite economic agenda - tariffs.

‘US Is Screwed If…’: Trump Fears Supreme Court Ruling As Tariff Empire Faces Trillions In Losses

Prez says he has 'plan B'

The US Supreme Court on Friday delivered a stunning rebuke to President Donald Trump , ruling in a 6–3 decision that his global tariffs are illegal.In opinion penned by Chief Justice John Roberts , the court said Trump did not have the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 to impose tariffs and “had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs, it would have done so expressly. ”The opinion upholds earlier rulings by the US Court of International Trade and a federal appeals court, both of which found that IEEPA—traditionally used to freeze assets and block financial transactions during national emergencies—did not implicitly authorize tariffs.In dissent were three conservative justices -- Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh -- who argued that the statute’s broad language granting the president authority to “regulate” economic transactions during a declared emergency should be read to encompass tariffs.According to the dissenters, the majority unduly narrowed presidential power at a time when economic threats from abroad, including currency manipulation and industrial overcapacity, warranted swift executive action. They contended that Congress, in drafting IEEPA, understood the president would need flexible tools to respond to evolving economic crises.But the majority rejected that interpretation, drawing a sharp distinction between regulating financial flows and levying import taxes—an authority the Constitution vests in Congress.The court emphasized that tariffs are a form of taxation and that delegations of taxing power must be explicit.The lead challengers in the case were US companies and trade associations whose members had paid billions of dollars in duties under the administration’s blanket tariffs imposed via IEEPA, and who were represented by Indian-American attorney Neal Katyal, a former Acting Solicitor General during the Obama administration.""Today, the US Supreme Court stood up for the rule of law, stood up for Americans everywhere. It's message is simple: Presidents are powerful, but our Constitution is more powerful still. In America, the chief justice said, only Congress can impose taxes on the American people, and that's what tariffs are. Tariffs are taxes,"" Katyal said, standing in front of the SCOTUS moments after the 6-3 opinion.On his part, Trump is said to have exploded when he heard about the ruling during a meeting of the National Governors Association, calling it a ""disgrace.""The ruling marks the first time the US Supreme Court has definitively struck down a major policy initiative of Trump’s second term. In other cases since his return to office in January, the court’s conservative majority has largely afforded him expansive leeway in wielding executive authority. But here, a coalition of three conservative and three liberal justices concluded that Trump exceeded the bounds set by Congress.The practical effect is immediate and sweeping. Much of the administration’s tariff agenda—especially the global Liberation Day tariffs first announced April—now stands on legally untenable ground. Economists at Penn-Wharton have estimated that more than $175 billion in tariff revenue would have to be refunded if the tariffs are invalidated, raising complex logistical and fiscal questions.Importers who paid the duties—ranging from multinational retailers to small manufacturers—could file claims for refunds through US Customs and Border Protection. Depending on how the Treasury processes those claims, repayments could ripple through corporate balance sheets and potentially lower consumer prices in some sectors, a prospect that buoyed markets on Friday.Attention now turns to the administration's “Plan B,"" with legal analysts noting that while IEEPA is off the table for blanket tariffs, other statutes provide narrower pathways. For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act allows tariffs on national security grounds, as Trump did during his first term with steel and aluminum. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes targeted tariffs in response to unfair trade practices.However, both mechanisms involve procedural requirements and substantive limits that make broad, across-the-board tariffs more difficult to justify. Other trade laws impose stricter criteria, require agency investigations, and often limit tariffs to specific sectors or countries.At the same time, the ruling injects uncertainty into global trade relationships. Negotiating pressure on countries like India could ease since the Trump administration can no longer credibly threaten across-the-board emergency tariffs under IEEPA to extract concessions. Instead of negotiating under the immediate risk of blanket tariffs, discussions may revert to more structured bilateral trade talks and sectoral agreements.Trump had repeatedly urged the justices to uphold his tariff authority. In a series of posts on social media, he warned that striking down the tariffs would trigger an economic “disaster,” weaken America’s leverage over China and other trading partners, and undermine his broader effort to revive domestic manufacturing.Yet the court’s decision signals that even a sympathetic conservative majority is not prepared to endorse expansive readings of executive power absent clear congressional authorization.The administration could also seek explicit congressional authorization for new tariffs, though that route would require bipartisan support in a divided political climate and a very narrow GOP majority in which there are Republican dissenters. Alternatively, it might narrow its focus—targeting specific industries such as electric vehicles or semiconductors—where national security arguments may be more defensible.","The US Supreme Court on Friday delivered a stunning rebuke to President Donald Trump.

Trump tariffs trashed: US businesses fret as court ruling 'worryingly silent' over refunds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-tariffs-trashed-us-businesses-fret-as-court-ruling-worryingly-silent-over-refunds/articleshow/128617060.cms,"‘Historic Embarrassment’ For Trump; US Supreme Court Blocks Global Tariffs In Shock Ruling

Businesses welcome ruling, markets respond positively



Thousands of lawsuits filed by affected companies



Tariffs increased costs for companies and consumers



Uncertainty remains despite court ruling



Companies explore alternative ways to recover losses



Thousands of US businesses scored a major victory after the US Supreme Court struck down emergency tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. However, while companies welcomed the decision, the process of getting refunds worth billions of dollars is expected to be slow and complex.In a landmark ruling with global economic implications, the court said Trump could not use the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs on imports. The decision could open the door for more than $175 billion in tariffs already collected by the US government to be refunded, according to economists at the Penn-Wharton Budget Model.Many companies had struggled to cope with Trump’s shifting trade policies, which used tariffs not only to address trade issues but also as leverage against other countries’ policies. Now, thousands of businesses—not just those that filed lawsuits—are considering whether to seek refunds.Stock markets in the US and Europe rose after the ruling. Shares of companies affected by tariffs, including luxury firms such as LVMH, Hermes, and Moncler, saw gains as investors reacted positively to the decision.Companies in sectors such as consumer goods, automobiles, manufacturing, and apparel were among the hardest hit.Many rely on low-cost production in countries like China, Vietnam, and India. The tariffs increased the cost of imports, reduced profits, and disrupted global supply chains.More than 1,800 tariff-related lawsuits have been filed in the US Court of International Trade since April, compared with fewer than two dozen cases in all of 2024.Major companies involved in the legal battle include subsidiaries of Toyota Group, retailer Costco, tire maker Goodyear, aluminum producer Alcoa, motorcycle manufacturer Kawasaki Motors, and eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica.Legal experts said many more companies may now join the lawsuits. However, the refund process could take months or even years.“Companies face the challenge of gathering detailed import data to calculate the tariffs paid under various regimes, which were applied over different time periods. Even multinational firms may not have all their data neatly organized,” said Nabeel Yousef, partner at law firm Freshfields.He added, “Even with the Friday ruling, it's not as if ‘on Monday, companies are going to start getting checks in the mail.’”The tariffs increased costs for businesses and consumers already dealing with inflation. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 90% of Trump’s tariffs were paid by American companies and consumers, not foreign exporters.The effective US tariff rate rose sharply to 11.7% as of November, compared with an average of 2.7% between 2022 and 2024, according to the Yale Budget Lab.Although businesses celebrated the decision, uncertainty remains. The US Court of International Trade is expected to handle the refund process, which experts say will be complicated.International Chamber of Commerce secretary general John Denton said the ruling was “worryingly silent” on how refunds would be managed.Trump administration officials said the US would continue to use other legal powers to impose tariffs when needed.“It’s not like tariffs are going away. They’re just going to be under a different umbrella,” said Ted Murphy, co-leader of Sidley Austin’s global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice.Tariffs on automobiles, including a 25% duty on vehicles imported from Mexico and Canada on national security grounds, remain in place.Some US companies, expecting delays in refunds, have already sold their rights to future refunds to investors at discounted rates—receiving about 25 to 30 cents on the dollar upfront.Logistics firm DHL said it would use technology to ensure customers receive refunds “accurately and efficiently” if approved.However, lower prices for consumers are unlikely, even if companies receive refunds.“We would definitely be filing for a refund as I imagine every other importer would. I highly doubt prices will go down though. That rarely occurs,” said Jason Cheung, CEO of toymaker Huntar Co.While the ruling is a major legal setback for Trump’s tariff policy, the financial and economic consequences will continue to unfold over the coming years.",The US Supreme Court struck down emergency tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.

‘US Is Screwed If…’: Trump Fears Supreme Court Ruling As Tariff Empire Faces Trillions In Losses

United States President Donald Trump expressed strong displeasure at the Supreme Court on Friday after it struck down his sweeping global tariff regime, calling the majority verdict ""a disgrace"" during a private meeting with governors, a person familiar with the president’s reaction told AP.Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said the Constitution makes it “very clear” that the authority to levy taxes, including tariffs, rests with Congress. “The Framers did not vest any part of the taxing power in the Executive Branch,” he noted.Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh dissented, with Kavanaugh arguing that irrespective of their policy merits, the tariffs were lawful based on constitutional text, historical practice and legal precedent.Trump was meeting privately with nearly two dozen governors from both parties when the decision was released. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The court also left unresolved whether companies would be eligible for refunds on the billions of dollars already paid under the tariff regime. Several firms, including retail giant Costco, have moved lower courts seeking repayment, with Kavanaugh cautioning that the process could prove complex.The Supreme Court ruling comes despite a series of short-term wins on the court’s emergency docket that have allowed Trump to push ahead with extraordinary flexes of executive power on issues ranging from high-profile firings to major federal funding cuts.The Republican president has been vocal about the case, calling it one of the most important in U.S. history and saying a ruling against him would be an economic body blow to the country. But legal opposition crossed the political spectrum, including libertarian and pro-business groups that are typically aligned with the GOP. Polling has found tariffs aren't broadly popular with the public, amid wider voter concern about affordability.The Constitution gives Congress the power to levy tariffs. But the Trump administration argued that a 1977 law allowing the president to regulate importation during emergencies also allows him to set tariffs. Other presidents have used the law dozens of times, often to impose sanctions, but Trump was the first president to invoke it for import taxes.","US President Donald Trump expressed strong displeasure at the Supreme Court on Friday after it struck down his sweeping global tariff regime.

‘US Is Screwed If…’: Trump Fears Supreme Court Ruling As Tariff Empire Faces Trillions In Losses

Here's the full order of the US Supreme Court



In a major setback to United State President Donald Trump’s economic agenda, the American Supreme Court on Friday invalidated his sweeping global tariff regime. The 6-3 ruling focused on duties introduced under an emergency powers statute, including the broad “reciprocal” tariffs applied to imports from nearly every country.The case marks the first major element of Trump’s second-term policy programme to be reviewed by the top court, which he helped reshape by appointing three conservative justices during his first presidency. Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh dissented from the majority view.Trump had repeatedly described the case as one of historic importance, warning that an adverse verdict would deal a serious blow to the US economy. However, opposition to the tariffs cut across ideological lines, drawing criticism from libertarian and pro-business organisations often aligned with Republicans. Public surveys have also indicated limited support for tariffs, particularly as voters remain concerned about rising living costs.The judgment comes even as Trump has secured a string of interim victories on the court’s emergency docket, enabling his administration to move ahead with assertive executive actions on matters such as high-profile dismissals and significant reductions in federal spending.Importantly, the ruling does not prevent the administration from imposing tariffs through other statutory routes. Although those alternatives come with tighter procedural and substantive limits, senior officials have indicated that efforts are underway to maintain the broader tariff framework using different legal authorities, reported AP.Under the US Constitution, the authority to impose tariffs rests with Congress. The administration had argued that a 1977 law permitting the president to regulate imports during national emergencies also extended to setting tariffs. While past presidents have relied on the statute multiple times, primarily to enforce sanctions, Trump was the first to invoke it as a basis for levying import duties.","The case marks the first major element of Trump’s second-term policy programme to be reviewed by the top court.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

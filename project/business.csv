Stock market recommendations:Nifty after a strong rally of 1900 points in just 15 sessions has entered a phase of sideways consolidation over the last 3 sessions, amid being in an overbought zone. The index tested the resistance level around 23,800 on Tuesday’s session, where it faced resistance, coinciding with the high from February 2025.Going ahead, we expect the index to consolidate in the range of 23,800-23,200 thus working off the overbought condition developed in the daily stochastic after the recent sharp rally. We believe consolidation should be considered as healthy retracement making a higher base, which will eventually pave way for further upside towards 24,100-24,200 levels in the coming weeks being the confluence of high of January 2025 and 50% retracement of the entire decline (26277-21965).On the downside, 23,200-23,000 would act as strong support being the confluence of the recent breakout area and 50 days EMA. Investors should focus on accumulating quality stocks with a medium-term perspective.Structurally, the current pullback of 1,900 points is the largest since the all-time high of September 2024, suggesting that rallies are becoming more extended. In the process the Nifty witnessed a faster pace of up-move where it regained previous 18 days of fall (23,807-21,965) in just 14 trading sessions, indicating structural turnaround backed by improvement in breadth as well as sentiment indicator. Any pullback from here should be capitalized as a buying opportunity, wherein volatility will prevail, amid upcoming result season and tariff related clarity from Trump.Bank Nifty in the last 3 sessions is seen consolidating in a range after a a rally of 4200 points (47,800-52,000) in just 9 sessions.Going ahead, we expect the index to consolidate in the range of 52,000-50,500 thus forming a base for the next leg of up move and in the process work off the overbought condition developed in the daily stochastic.We believe the current breather should be used to accumulate quality banking stocks as we expect the index to sustain above the recent 10 weeks range breakout area (50,500-48,000) and gradually head towards 53,000 levels in coming weeks being the measuring implication of the last 10 weeks range breakout.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Larsen and Toubro and Indian Energy Exchange are the top stock picks for today.

EPFO to increase auto settlement limit to 5 lakhs for PF claims and allow UPI withdrawals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-to-increase-auto-settlement-limit-to-5-lakhs-for-pf-claims-and-allow-upi-withdrawals/articleshow/119812227.cms,"Representative image

Auto settlement claims

UPI withdrawals for PF members

The Employees Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has announced to increase in the auto-settlement of advance claims (ASAC) limit, raising it five times from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. The move is designed to enhance the 'ease of living' for its 7.5 crore members, sources told news agency ANI.According to sources, Sumita Dawra, Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, approved the proposal during the 113th meeting of the Executive Committee (EC) of the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, on March 28.“This revision will enhance the ease of living for crores of our members,” Dawra said in a statement. Following this approval, the recommendation will be forwarded for final approval by the CBT. Once approved, EPFO members will be able to withdraw up to Rs 5 lakh through the auto-settlement process.EPFO’s auto-settlement process has seen tremendous growth, processing a record 2.16 crore auto-claims as of March 6, 2025, compared to just 89.52 lakh claims in the previous year. This reflects the increasing efficiency of the system, with 95% of claims now being settled automatically within three days.“The auto-settlement process has greatly simplified claim settlements, significantly reducing the time and human intervention required,” said Ramesh Krishnamurthi, Central Provident Fund Commissioner. “We are committed to making the process more efficient, and with the increasing number of automated claims, our goal is to make accessing PF funds easier for all members.”Additionally, EPFO has expanded the categories for which advance claims can be settled automatically, now covering illness, education, marriage, housing, and more. The system’s improvements have also led to a reduction in the rejection rate of claims, from 50% last year to just 30% this year.In another game-changing development, EPFO will soon allow Provident Fund (PF) withdrawals through Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and ATMs. The Ministry of Labour and Employment has given approval for the plan, and members will be able to access their funds through UPI and ATMs by the end of May or June 2025.“This new system will make it even more convenient for members to access their PF savings instantly through UPI and ATMs,” Dawra said. “It is a groundbreaking move that will set a precedent for other government savings schemes, like the General Provident Fund (GPF) for government employees and the Public Provident Fund (PPF) for bank customers.”","The Employees Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has announced to increase in the auto-settlement of advance claims (ASAC) limit, raising it five times from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.

ICICI Securities has reiterated its ‘buy’ recommendation on GAIL (India) with a target price of Rs 245. Despite its Oct-Dec quarterly results disappointing investors, analysts feel that its earnings may improve steadily over the next 12 months, driven by one-offs impacting trading that have resolved somewhat in Q4 and should have limited impact over FY26. They also expect sustained volume growth for transmission/trading as gas demand grows over FY26 and FY27. The valuation of the stock remains attractive, they said.Motilal Oswal Financial Services has maintained its ‘neutral’ rating on Havells India with a target price of Rs 1,650. Analysts said that the company’s management was optimistic about growth prospects across core categories, supported by margin improvement initiatives. The company continues to invest in manufacturing, brand building, distribution, talent development, premiumization, and R&D, positioning itself for long-term success. However, the lighting segment remains impacted by pricing pressure, though volume growth remains strong. The company is focused on expanding its presence in professional lighting to drive profitability.Emkay Global Financial Services has upgraded Maruti Suzuki to ‘buy’ from ‘add’ with a revised target price of Rs 13,500. Analysts said that for Maruti, historically, new launches have driven volume growth in passenger vehicles and the company’s launch cycle is turning positive in FY26. This coincides with early signs of improvement seen in small cars with potential consumption boosts providing further optionality. However, sustenance of such improvement needs to be watched.Anand Rathi Share & Stock Brokers has given a ‘buy’ rating on MOIL with a target price of Rs 400. Analysts said that the company is in the process of expanding its mining capacity. It’s also setting up a high-speed shaft to hoist capacity, which would help achieve enhanced volumes. The management told the analysts that employee cost is expected to fall over the next two years. With manganese’s essential role in steel manufacturing, the company is set to capitalise on India’s steel growth story, owing to its dominant market share.Cantor Fitzgerald has initiated its coverage of Adani Power with a ‘buy’ rating and a target price of Rs 595. Analysts said the company owns and operates 11 thermal power plants and one solar power plant in India. It’s the largest privately-owned thermal power generator in India and was the first player to use more advanced supercritical technology.

Tesla and tech stocks lead declines

Global impact and rising fears

As President Donald Trump’s ""Liberation Day"" approaches, stock markets around the world saw declines on Monday, driven by fears of the tariffs set to take effect on Wednesday. From Wall Street to Wellington, New Zealand, global markets faced significant sell-offs ahead of the impending economic moves.In the US, the S&P 500 dropped by 0.6%, following one of its most significant losses in recent years. The index is poised to close the first quarter of the year with a nearly 6% loss, which would make it the worst quarter in almost three years. While the S&P 500 managed to reduce some of its losses after an early 1.7% decline, the Nasdaq composite, heavily impacted by drops in Tesla, Nvidia, and other Big Tech stocks, plunged by 1.6%, according to news agency AP.The fall in US markets mirrored a global sell-off, as investors expressed concern that Trump’s upcoming tariffs would exacerbate inflation and slow global economic growth. The tariffs, set to be announced on Wednesday, are designed to match the tax burdens imposed by other nations on the US, with specifics still unclear. Trump has signalled that these moves are in part to bring more manufacturing jobs back to the USTrump's tariffs, designed to match trade barriers imposed by other countries on the U.S., are set to begin on Wednesday. The tariffs have raised concerns that they will increase inflation, potentially leading to a global recession. As uncertainty grows, major stock indices around the world have been hit hard.The S&P 500 dropped by 0.8%, contributing to its near 6% quarterly loss, which could mark the worst quarter in nearly three years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average showed resilience, edging up slightly by less than 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%, weighed down by declines in major tech stocks like Tesla and Nvidia.In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Japan suffered a significant 4.1% drop, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and China’s Shanghai Composite also saw losses. Europe was not immune either, with London’s FTSE 100, Paris’ CAC 40, and Frankfurt’s DAX all posting losses of over 1%.In the commodities market, oil prices showed signs of strength despite broader market declines:Gold and Bonds: As stocks fell, safe-haven assets like gold and U.S. Treasury bonds gained. Gold briefly topped $3,160 per ounce, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.22% from 4.27% late Friday.Goldman Sachs economists have raised their forecast for inflation and lowered their U.S. growth projection, now predicting a 35% chance of a recession in the next year, up from 20% previously. The tariffs could further stoke inflationary pressures and hinder global economic growth, prompting businesses and consumers to scale back spending.The markets remain uncertain about what Trump’s tariffs will ultimately entail. While some analysts are optimistic that the tariffs might be less severe than feared, the continued unpredictability is likely to fuel volatility. Some also worry that the tariffs could add to global economic pain by reducing confidence and prompting businesses to cut jobs.Among the hardest-hit stocks were Tesla, which fell 4.7%, and Nvidia, which dropped 4.1%, as concerns about overvalued tech stocks lingered. Additionally, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines both saw losses, highlighting concerns that the broader economy might be cooling off.In mergers and acquisitions news, Mr. Cooper saw a significant rise of 16.6% after announcing its acquisition by Rocket Mortgage in a $9.4 billion deal.This worldwide sell-off reflects the growing concern over economic risks tied to the new tariffs, and investors are bracing for further market turbulence as Trump’s tariffs loom. The economic uncertainty surrounding this issue is likely to keep markets on edge, with analysts keeping a close eye on potential ripple effects throughout the global economy.","The S&P 500 dropped by 0.8%, contributing to its near 6% quarterly loss.

Expansion inertia

Other major Chinese developers report losses

Hong Kong-listed property giant Vanke reported a significant annual loss of 49.5 billion yuan ($6.8 billion) on Monday, attributing the sharp decline to falling sales and shrinking profit margins despite efforts by Beijing to revive the struggling housing market.The company stated that 2024 had been an ""exceptionally challenging year,"" apologizing for the ""distress caused"" by the significant loss and ongoing pressure on liquidity, news agency AFP reported.Vanke acknowledged that it had “failed to break free from expansion inertia of high-debt, high-turnover and high-leverage in a timely manner,” which led to aggressive investment and over-expansion. This overextension contributed to the company’s substantial losses, marking Vanke’s first annual loss since it was listed in 1991. The firm’s loss exceeded its initial January estimate of $6.2 billion. Revenue also dropped by 26% year-on-year to $47.3 million.As part of the company’s ongoing reshuffling, Vanke’s Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Liu Xiao, resigned on Monday due to ""work adjustments."" The company confirmed that Liu will continue to work with the company, focusing on strategic investment business.The shakeup comes after the resignation of Vanke’s CEO, Zhu Jiusheng, in January due to health reasons. Reports from Chinese outlets suggested Zhu had been ""taken away by public security authorities,"" though the nature of the alleged offenses was unclear.Despite Beijing’s efforts to stabilize the property sector, including a policy package announced in November to lower deed tax rates in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, Vanke faced a net loss of $4.35 billion in the final quarter of 2024. The company warned of intensified liquidity pressure due to concentrated repayment obligations on its public debts this year. Chinese authorities are reportedly considering plans to help Vanke plug a $6.8 billion funding gap this year.Vanke is not the only property developer facing financial troubles. Kaisa, another troubled developer, reported a 48.4% increase in losses to $4.03 billion for 2024. Country Garden also reported a $4.5 billion annual loss, with total debt reaching $34.9 billion at the end of 2024.Vanke’s struggles are part of a broader crisis in China’s real estate sector, which has been dealing with a massive debt burden and severe financial distress for many developers.","Hong Kong-listed property giant Vanke reported a significant annual loss of 49.5 billion yuan ($6.8 billion) on Monday.

Can Trump’s auto tariffs save Musk's Tesla from BYD?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/can-trumps-auto-tariffs-save-musks-tesla-from-byd/articleshow/119809239.cms,"Created with ChatGPT 4

Why it matters

Tariffs may not stop BYD’s global takeover: Tesla may be protected in the US market, but China’s BYD — now the world’s top EV seller — is aggressively expanding into Europe, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, where Tesla is losing ground.

Tesla may be protected in the US market, but China’s BYD — now the world’s top EV seller — is aggressively expanding into Europe, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, where Tesla is losing ground. Tesla’s international brand is under siege: Elon Musk’s close alignment with President Trump is fueling backlash abroad. From EU protests to Canadian subsidy cuts, Tesla is facing a reputational crisis that no tariff can fix.

Elon Musk’s close alignment with President Trump is fueling backlash abroad. From EU protests to Canadian subsidy cuts, Tesla is facing a reputational crisis that no tariff can fix. The China EV threat isn’t theoretical — it’s here: BYD’s latest innovations, like 5-minute ultra-fast charging and advanced hybrids, are reshaping consumer expectations. Tesla is no longer the undisputed tech leader in the electric vehicle race.

— it’s here: BYD’s latest innovations, like 5-minute ultra-fast charging and advanced hybrids, are reshaping consumer expectations. Tesla is no longer the undisputed tech leader in the electric vehicle race. Trump’s tariffs could backfire long-term: By disrupting the global EV supply chain — especially battery components from Japan and South Korea — the tariffs risk undermining the very infrastructure the US needs to compete with China.

By disrupting the global EV supply chain — especially battery components from Japan and South Korea — the tariffs risk undermining the very infrastructure the US needs to compete with China. US consumers could take a financial hit: Goldman Sachs estimates the tariffs could raise car prices by $5,000 to $15,000. That narrows the price gap between Tesla EVs and cheaper gas-powered vehicles, threatening demand at home.

The big picture

What they’re saying

Long term I think Tesla stock’s going to do fine, so maybe it’s a buying opportunity. Elon Musk

Between the lines

1. Tariffs hurt Tesla’s rivals far more than Tesla

2. Tesla’s political baggage is building

3. China’s EV rise isn’t accidental

What’s next

Global dominance is slipping from Musk’s hands. Tesla is still a major force, but it’s no longer the inevitable EV champion. With Chinese competitors innovating faster and scaling cheaper, Musk’s global strategy needs a reboot.

Trump’s tariffs are a double-edged sword. While they buy Tesla time in the US, they risk dismantling the global non-China EV supply chain — which includes Korean and Japanese battery makers essential to Tesla’s long-term competitiveness.

BYD’s global march continues. Consumers can’t buy BYD vehicles in the US — yet. But elsewhere, they’re exploding. BYD has nailed pricing, design, and infrastructure.

Tesla’s future isn’t guaranteed. Protectionism may offer short-term relief, but it won’t stop the global EV shift already underway. And in that race, China — not the US — is in the driver’s seat.

Trade policy can shape short-term winners. But the bigger game—technological leadership, market share, and brand trust—is still very much in play.

And in that game, Tesla is not the only player anymore. It may not even be the favorite.

US President Donald Trump ’s sweeping 25% tariff on all imported vehicles and parts is a windfall for Elon Musk’s Tesla — at least on American soil. But it may prove meaningless against the rising global threat posed by China’s electric vehicle juggernaut, BYD.In the US, Tesla is now the least exposed major carmaker to Trump’s new trade policy. The EV giant produces every car it sells in the US at massive factories in California and Texas. This domestic manufacturing footprint helps Musk sidestep the very tariffs that are clobbering rivals like GM, Toyota, and Hyundai, whose global supply chains cross numerous borders.But this insulation only applies inside the US. Tesla’s real danger is coming from abroad, where BYD is moving ahead.In late 2024, BYD leapfrogged Tesla in global EV sales and revenue, crossing the $100 billion mark. Backed early on by Warren Buffett and powered by aggressive tech innovation, BYD now poses the clearest threat Musk has ever faced. The company unveiled a new EV charging system that delivers 400 kilometers of range in just five minutes — an innovation Tesla has yet to match.As per a report in Asia Times, Elon Musk saw it coming. In early 2024, he warned that without tariffs, Chinese EV makers would “demolish” global rivals. “Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world,” he told shareholders. “If there are no trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.”""Tesla a relative beneficiary given 100% US production footprint, substantial US sourcing and with Model Y competing in a midsize crossover segment where close to 50% of vehicles could be subject to tariffs,” TD Cowen’s Itay Michaeli told Asia Times.Analysts are taking note. “Tesla is the least exposed auto giant,” says CFRA Research’s Garrett Nelson, citing the company’s US-based production and sourcing. Deutsche Bank agrees: “Tesla and Ford appear to be the most shielded from tariff impacts,” though Ford still faces risks from imported engines.But even as Tesla enjoys short-term protection, Musk’s long-term problem is not going away — and it’s not just BYD. Chinese EV startups like XPeng, Nio, and Zeekr are rising fast, especially in emerging markets where cost matters more than brand identity, the Asia Times report said.The 25% tariff is expected to raise car prices in the US by $5,000 to $15,000 depending on the model, according to Goldman Sachs. That’s a sharp blow to companies like Hyundai and Toyota, which import a significant portion of their vehicles to the US despite also having American factories.General Motors is also in the tariff crosshairs. Roughly 40% of GM’s US sales are from vehicles built in Mexico or Canada. GM also imports key models like the Equinox and Trax — meaning it will have to either absorb the cost or pass it to consumers.European brands, especially Germany’s Volkswagen and Italy’s Stellantis, are even more exposed. These companies were betting on US growth to offset slumping sales in China — and Trump’s tariffs could derail that pivot.Musk’s role as head of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has sparked massive backlash. Protesters are now regularly demonstrating outside Tesla showrooms in the US and Europe, with signs comparing Musk to fascist leaders and labeling his vehicles “Swasticars.”“Hey, hey, ho, ho, Elon Musk has got to go!” chanted several dozen protesters outside a Tesla showroom in Dublin, California—roughly 35 miles east of San Francisco—as a small group of Trump supporters stood across the street waving American flags, an AP report said.In nearby Berkeley, a larger crowd surrounded another Tesla location, chanting to the rhythm of drums. “We're living in a fascist state,” said Dennis Fagaly, a retired high school teacher from Oakland. “And we need to stop this or we'll lose our whole country and everything that is good about the United States.”In February alone, Tesla registrations in the EU dropped 47%. In New York, lawmakers are pushing to divest state pension funds from Tesla stock. In Canada, several provinces have pulled Tesla from EV rebate programs.Tesla is in the middle of what one analyst called a “brand tornado crisis.” “This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a recent research note, said the AP report.Tesla constitutes a large part of Musk's wealth. It's the Tesla that helped Musk become the world's wealthiest person. But Musk runs the risk of losing a part of his fortune due to his political activism. Even Musk has admitted, “It’s costing me a lot to be in this job,” referencing the blowback from his Trump alliance and his role at DOGE.Trump may be loud about tariffs, but China has quietly mastered them for decades. As Michael Dunne explains, “China’s love affair with tariffs—quiet, almost clandestine—has been going on for decades.” Through a mix of heavy import taxes, limited licenses, and industrial policy, Beijing built an auto empire.In 2024, China produced 31 million vehicles — three times more than the US. Despite being the world's largest auto market, it has never allowed car imports to exceed 6% of the domestic market.This fortress model is what allowed BYD and others to grow into global players. Now, they’re scaling internationally — exactly as Tesla begins to stumble.(With inputs from agencies)","Tesla may be protected in the US market, but China’s BYD is aggressively expanding into Europe, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Tesla is no longer the undisputed tech leader in the electric vehicle race. By disrupting the global EV supply chain, the tariffs risk undermining the very infrastructure the US needs to compete with China.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119811599,imgsize-902194,width-400,resizemode-4/119811599.jpg"

Startup founder Charlie Javice convicted of defrauding JPMorgan Chase in $175 million scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/startup-founder-charlie-javice-convicted-of-defrauding-jpmorgan-chase-in-175-million-scam/articleshow/119689111.cms,"‘They could lie and cheat’

Defence argued JPMorgan had “buyer’s remorse”

Awaiting sentencing

Charlie Javice , the founder of a startup promising to transform the student financial aid process, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase out of $175 million by vastly exaggerating her customer numbers.A Manhattan federal court jury delivered the guilty verdict on Friday after a five-week trial leaving 32 year old Javice along with her co-defendant, Olivier Amar, with the possibility of facing decades behind bars.As her verdict was read, Javice remained expressionless, with her lawyer placing a hand on her back in consolation. She left the courtroom without commenting, brushing past reporters.Javice was in her mid-20s when she founded Frank, a company promising to simplify the notoriously complex free application for federal student aid (FAFSA) process. Marketed as a tool to help students access financial aid faster for a small fee, Frank gained traction, even earning Javice a spot on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list.JPMorgan saw an opportunity and acquired the startup in 2021, believing it had access to a vast pool of young clients. However, the bank later discovered that instead of the 4 million users Javice had claimed, and a projected 10 million by year’s end, the real figure was only around 300,000.A supposed customer list that Frank provided turned out to be largely fabricated.Prosecutors argued that Javice and Amar, Frank’s chief growth and acquisition officer, knowingly misled JPMorgan to secure the multimillion-dollar deal.“While Javice and Amar may have thought that they could lie and cheat their way to a huge payday, their lies caught up with them, and they now stand convicted by a jury of their peers,” Acting Manhattan US attorney Matthew Podolsky said in a statement, quoted by news agency AP.Evidence presented in court revealed that when Frank’s chief software engineer, Patrick Vovor, was asked to generate synthetic data to support the exaggerated user numbers, he refused. He testified that when he questioned the legality of the request, Javice and Amar reassured him, even joking that they didn’t want to end up “in orange prison jumpsuits.” Instead, prosecutors said Javice later paid a college friend $18,000 to create millions of fake names and fabricated details.Javice’s lawyer, Jose Baez, countered that JPMorgan knew what it was getting when it bought Frank, claiming the bank manufactured fraud allegations due to “buyer’s remorse” after regulatory changes rendered the data less valuable for recruiting new customers.“JPMorgan is not telling the truth,” Baez insisted, “They knew the numbers.”Javice and Amar were convicted on all four counts in their indictments, including conspiracy, bank fraud, and wire fraud, charges that each carry a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.Javice, who has been free on a $2 million bail since her 2023 arrest, is due to be sentenced on 23 July. Her defence team has requested that the judge set aside the verdict, arguing that the evidence was insufficient.Meanwhile, a dispute remains over whether Javice and Amar should wear ankle monitors while awaiting sentencing. Her lawyers argue that the device would interfere with her new career teaching pilates for three to four hours a day.Judge Alvin K Hellerstein is set to rule on these matters next week.","Charlie Javice found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase out of $175 million by vastly exaggerating her customer numbers.

"US economy grows 2.4% in Q4, uncertainty looms amid inflation concerns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-economy-grows-2-4-in-q4-uncertainty-looms-amid-inflation-concerns/articleshow/119605016.cms,"US economy (Photo-AP)

The US economy expanded at a healthy annual rate of 2.4% in the final quarter of 2024, according to a slight upgrade in the government’s growth estimate released on Thursday.The growth was driven by a strong year-end surge in consumer spending , despite challenges posed by a slowdown in business investment and declining inventories.The increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was down from a 3.1% pace in the third quarter, signalling a deceleration in growth. The overall 2024 economy grew by 2.8%, slightly down from 2.9% in 2023, news agency AP reported.Consumer spending was a key driver, growing at a 4% pace in the fourth quarter, up from 3.7% in the third quarter. However, business investment fell, with a notable 8.7% drop in investment in equipment. A decline in business inventories contributed to a 0.84 percentage point reduction in GDP growth for the quarter.A key measure of the economy's underlying strength, which excludes volatile components such as exports, inventories, and government spending, showed a healthy 2.9% annual growth rate in Q4, slightly revised down from the previous estimate of 3.2%. This was also lower than the 3.4% pace recorded in Q3.While consumer spending provided a boost, inflationary pressures continued to rise toward the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and exceeding the Fed's 2% target. Core PCE inflation , which excludes volatile food and energy prices, registered 2.6%, up from 2.2% in the prior quarter.Despite the strong finish to 2024, the outlook for 2025 remains uncertain, particularly with the trade policies of President Donald Trump . His decision to impose new tariffs — including a 25% tax on imported cars — could lead to higher inflation and disrupt business investment, threatening future growth.The fourth-quarter GDP data reflects the economy before the surge in policy uncertainty and trade tensions escalated, particularly under Trump’s administration. As Ryan Sweet, Chief US Economist at Oxford Economics, noted, ""The combination of policy uncertainty, tariffs, and tightening financial market conditions are weighing on growth early this year.""In addition to trade concerns, US consumer confidence has dropped sharply, driven by fears of inflation and the impact of tariffs. Major retailers have adjusted their expectations for 2025, with some warning that consumers are already curbing their spending. As the year progresses, the economic landscape could face additional challenges from both domestic and international pressures.","US economy expanded at a healthy annual rate of 2.4% in the final quarter of 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

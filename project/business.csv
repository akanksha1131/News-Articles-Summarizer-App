Shook some empires that needed shaking, says Hindenburg founder

MUMBAI: Hindenburg Research , the US-based short-seller whose reports had shaved off about $140 billion from Adani Group 's market valuation in early 2023, pushed the Indian govt and markets regulator Sebi on the backfoot, and left Indian investors divided whether to support it or oppose, is winding down. Calling Adani's businesses ""the largest con in corporate history"", Hindenburg had alleged corporate malfeasance including stock price manipulation, cooking its books and other frauds.The group had denied all the allegations.Hindenburg had also targeted Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval, alleging the duo of investing in the same offshore funds that the Adani Group had used to manipulate their stock prices. The couple had denied those allegations.Announcing the decision on Wednesday night, founder Nate Anderson said he viewed ""Hindenburg as a chapter"" in his life, and ""not a central thing"" that defined him.In Nov 2024, Adani and some of his associates were indicted by two US govt arms. The US department of justice and the Securities Exchange Commission alleged that Adani Group executives and their associates had committed wire frauds and misled investors as the conglomerate was paying about $220 million to Indian govt officials to win business.Over the next six months, Anderson said he would be working to release articles and videos to open-source how the team went about their business of investigating corporate frauds, corruption and malfeasance across the world. Since its founding in 2017, ""nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking,"" Anderson said in his note.Almost two years to the date, Hindenburg had released a 110-page report on the Adani Group alleging various types of corporate malfeasance. Following the report's release, over the next five weeks, about $140 billion worth of the group's market value was lost. As a result, as the net worth of Gautam Adani , the group's chairman, fell, his ranking in the Forbes billionaire list went down from third richest in the world to out of the top 25th.Last Aug, Hindenburg had released a report against the Sebi chief. ""We find it unsurprising that Sebi was reluctant to follow a trail (in the Adani affair) that may have led to its own chairperson,"" the Hindenburg report said.After the report was published, several opposition lawmakers demanded Sebi chief Buch's resignation while the BJP-led governing coalition at the Centre backed her.In Nov 2024, Adani and some of his associates were indicted by two US govt arms. The US department of justice and the Securities Exchange Commission alleged that Adani Group executives and their associates had committed wire frauds and misled investors as the conglomerate was paying about $220 million to Indian govt officials to win business.

The US Federal Reserve could cut rates three or four times this year if inflation data cooperates, with a first cut possible before July, a senior bank official said Thursday.Headline consumer inflation rose for a third straight month in December as energy prices jumped, according to data published Wednesday, but a widely watched measure eased slightly, raising hopes that underlying inflation may be moderating.""The inflation that we got yesterday was very good,"" Fed governor Christopher Waller told CNBC, noting that underlying price pressures excluding volatile food and energy costs had been close to target on a monthly basis.The US central bank has been paring back interest rates in recent months, cutting by a full percentage point since September to bolster the labor market.But in recent months, headline inflation has ticked higher, raising concerns that the Fed may have to pause further cuts throughout much of 2025.At the most recent rate decision in December, Fed policymakers voted to cut rates by a quarter percentage-point to between 4.25 and 4.50, and penciled in just two rate cuts this year.Waller, who is a permanent voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee told CNBC that he could support lowering rates as many as four times this year, depending on the data.""I may be a little more optimistic about inflation coming down than the rest of my colleagues,"" he said, adding that if the data didn't ""cooperate"", the Fed may be back to cutting just once or twice this year.Asked about the timing of cuts, Waller said if the data came in as he expected, it was ""reasonable"" to think rate cuts could come in the first half of the year.He also refused to rule out supporting a cut as soon as the Fed's March rate decision, if the data supported it.""I can certainly see rate cuts happening sooner than maybe the markets are pricing in,"" he said.Futures traders assign a roughly 70 percent chance that the Fed will remain on pause through the March rate decision, and a roughly 80 percent probability of no more than two cuts this year, according to data from CME Group.Waller was also asked about the likely impact of President-elect Donald Trump's tariff proposals, which included threats to impose sweeping tariffs of as much as 20 percent on all goods entering the United States.Many economists have said these policies could push up prices, at least in the short term, while Trump and his allies have either dismissed these concerns, or insisted that any pressures would be counteracted by other policies, including energy deregulation.""I don't think tariffs are going to have a significant impact or persistent effect on inflation,"" Waller said. ""But we'll just have to wait and see what happens.""He said most of the analysts on Wall Street estimate that Trump's tariff plans would have ""some marginal effect and short-lived effect on prices,"" but that it would not lead to ""persistent"" inflation.","US Federal Reserve could cut rates three or four times this year if inflation data cooperates, a senior bank official says.

This marked the lowest number since February last year.The four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly volatility, dipped slightly by 750 to 212,750, indicating stability.Meanwhile, the overall figure of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week ending 4 January fell by 18,000 to 1.86 million.Weekly jobless claims serve as a key indicator of layoffs, and despite this rise, the broader labour market remains strong.In December, the labour department reported a surge in job growth, with employers adding 256,000 positions. The unemployment rate also ticked down to 4.1 per cent, reflecting sustained hiring momentum.The final job reports of 2024 showcase that the US economy appears to be shifting into a post-pandemic phase characterised by steady growth, elevated borrowing costs, low unemployment, and moderately higher inflation.In another positive sign, the government reported that US job openings rose unexpectedly in November to 8.1 million, up from 7.8 million in October, marking the highest figure since February. This suggests that companies remain eager to hire, even as the labour market shows signs of loosening.Though layoffs fall into a healthy category by historical standards, several high-profile companies have followed the job-cutting trend in the past few months.This week, Meta, Facebook’s parent company, revealed plans to cut 5 per cent of its workforce, while Jack Daniel’s maker, Brown-Forman, announced a 12 per cent reduction in its global staff.Earlier, late in 2024, corporate giants such as GM, Boeing, Cargill, and Stellantis also revealed their plans for job cuts. Despite these isolated announcements, layoffs overall remain low by historical standards, underscoring the resilience of the US job market .This labour market data might be used by the federal reserve to guide its monetary policy decisions, with less pressure to reduce interest rates further in the near future.","Jobless benefits applications increased by 14,000 to 203,000 in the week ending 11 January.

US core inflation eases for first time in six months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-core-inflation-eases-for-first-time-in-six-months/articleshow/117270847.cms,"PCE Prices



US consumer prices rose in December by less than forecast after months of faster underlying inflation persuaded the Federal Reserve to signal a pause in interest-rate cuts.The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — increased 0.2% after rising 0.3% four straight months, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures showed Wednesday.Cheaper hotel stays, a smaller advance in medical care services and relatively tame rent increases helped restrain the December figure.While the easing in the CPI is welcome, Fed officials would need to see a series of subdued readings after months of elevated prints to reassure them that inflation progress has resumed. Lingering price pressures have contributed to a deep selloff in global bond markets and fueled concerns that the Fed eased policy too quickly at the end of last year.Combined with last week’s strong jobs report, policymakers are widely expected to leave rates unchanged at their meeting later this month, and traders generally don’t see another cut until later this year.Treasury yields slid and S&P 500 index futures rose while the dollar declined after the CPI data.Economists see the core gauge as a better indicator of the underlying inflation trend than the overall CPI that includes often-volatile food and energy costs. The headline measure rose 0.4% from the prior month, with over 40% of the advance due to energy.This is the last inflation report of President Joe Biden’s tenure, an administration dogged by high prices coming out of the pandemic that surged a cumulative 20% while he was in office. Donald Trump will be sworn in next week, and economists generally anticipate his policies — particularly on tariffs — will put upward pressure on inflation, and measures of consumers’ expectations have been rising recently as well.The advance in the CPI was also led by food prices, airfares, new and used cars, auto insurance and medical care. Goods costs excluding food and energy rose a smaller 0.1% after a 0.3% November increase. Also taking out used cars, goods prices fell.Shelter prices, the largest category within services, climbed 0.3% in December for a second month. Owners’ equivalent rent as well as rent of primary residence — subsets of shelter — both ticked up following the smallest gains since 2021.Excluding housing and energy, service prices rose 0.2%, the smallest increase since July, according to Bloomberg calculations. While central bankers have stressed the importance of looking at such a metric when assessing the overall inflation trajectory, they compute it based on a separate index.That measure — known as the personal consumption expenditures price index — doesn’t put as much weight on shelter as the CPI, which is one reason why it’s trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target. Several categories that feed through to the PCE from the producer price index, a measure of wholesale inflation that was released Tuesday, were mostly tame. However, the PPI’s gauge of airfares picked up notably.Policymakers also pay close attention to wage growth, as it can help inform expectations for consumer spending — the main engine of the economy. A separate report Wednesday that combines the inflation figures with recent wage data showed real hourly earnings grew 1% from a year ago, the smallest annual advance since July.While data on retail sales, inflation expectations and the housing market will be released in the next two weeks, this is the last major economic report Fed officials will see before their Jan. 28-29 meeting.Recent speeches and forecasts have indicated policymakers are still wary of upside risks to inflation and that they prefer a cautious approach to adjusting rates.","Consumer prices rose in December by less than forecast after months of faster underlying inflation.

Understandable Due to Economic Pressures Concerned About Job Security

Meta , the parent company of Facebook , Instagram, and WhatsApp, is set to lay off approximately 3,600 employees identified as low performers, according to an internal memo first reported by Bloomberg. CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed the move in the memo, describing it as a strategy to “raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster.”The layoffs, affecting about 5% of Meta’s 72,400-strong workforce as of September, are part of what Zuckerberg called an “intense year” for the company. Employees in the United States will be notified of their status by February 10, with international employees to be informed later, AFP reported.“We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year,” Zuckerberg stated, “but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.” He noted that some employees who underperformed in the last period may be retained if there is optimism about their future contributions. Those laid off will receive “generous severance,” the CEO added.The company plans to replace the outgoing employees with new hires later this year.This is not Meta’s first wave of job cuts. The company laid off over 11,000 employees in November 2022 and cut an additional 10,000 jobs in subsequent months.The announcement follows a series of policy shifts at Meta, including the elimination of its US fact-checking program, which had been criticised by conservatives as censorship. Zuckerberg also unveiled changes to content moderation policies, easing restrictions on divisive topics such as immigration and gender while loosening rules on hate speech.Last week, Meta also announced reductions to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) team and scaled back related programs. The policy changes have drawn praise from Republican figures and criticism from Democrats, with some accusing Zuckerberg of aligning with conservative ideas ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20.Meanwhile, Zuckerberg speaking on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast last week, revealed that Meta and other leading tech companies are developing AI systems capable of handling complex coding tasks currently performed by human engineers.He announced plans to replace midlevel software engineers with artificial intelligence by 2025, signaling a major shift in how the tech giant approaches software development.Meta’s shares fell Tuesday following the layoff news, reflecting investor concerns over the company's broader direction.","Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is set to lay off approximately 3,600 employees identified as low performers.

Subtle or just the same?

Walmart ’s new logo refresh, the first in 17 years, is drawing widespread attention online, though perhaps not the kind the retail giant was hoping for. The changes, described by the company as a modernization rooted in tradition, feature a thicker font, a deeper blue background, and a “more energised” yellow spark icon.Despite Walmart’s framing of the update as a reflection of its evolution, many social media users have responded with disbelief over what they perceive as minimal changes.“Walmart just unveiled their new logo. It looks the f***ing same,” one person tweeted, summing up the sentiments of many.Another user sarcastically observed, “Oh wow I now feel the urge to spend a million dollars at Walmart.”The refreshed design, inspired by typefaces used in Walmart’s earlier branding, was meant to modernize its visual identity while keeping it familiar to loyal customers. However, the subtlety was lost on some online observers.“Walmart unveils their new logo. Is this a joke? It looks exactly the same 🤦🏼‍♀️,” one post read. Another quipped, “If you've ever been a third-grade girl, you know the difference — the old one is a sun, and the new one is a flower 😁.”Some users questioned the necessity of the changes. ""Walmart re-did their logo. This is the before and after. I can't believe someone got paid for this,"" one user posted alongside comparison images of the old and new designs. Another quipped, ""WALMART CHANGES LOGO. Finds more boring look. Can you tell which is old and which is new?""Meanwhile, some resorted to memes to describe the situation.Despite the criticism, Walmart executives maintain that the refresh is not a drastic rebrand but rather a thoughtful update meant to reflect the company’s status as a digital-first, omnichannel retailer.“This update demonstrates our evolving capabilities and commitment to serve customers of today and tomorrow,” William White, Walmart US’s chief marketing officer, said when unveiling the logo.While big brands often spend considerable time and money on subtle logo tweaks, public reaction isn’t always warm.","Walmart's new logo is the first in 17 years.

China discusses sale of TikTok US to Elon Musk as one possible option,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-discusses-sale-of-tiktok-us-to-elon-musk-as-one-possible-option/articleshow/117219501.cms,"Musk thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. (AI image for representation only.)

Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd, the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court.But the justices signaled during arguments on January 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump ’s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.A potential high-profile deal with one of Trump’s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump’s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.Under one scenario that’s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk’s X — the former Twitter — would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X’s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It’s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It’s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. “In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,” he wrote on X. “Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.”ByteDance and TikTok representatives didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China’s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok’s future, also didn’t respond to requests for comment.The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok’s fate may no longer be in ByteDance’s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.The Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company’s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing’s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok’s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.TikTok’s US operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That’s a substantial sum even for the world’s richest person. It’s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc business, the person added.ByteDance’s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok’s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution’s First Amendment.A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban — which takes effect Jan. 19 — so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to “save” the app and there’s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.On a practical level, spinning off TikTok’s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be “extraordinarily difficult.”It’s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O’Leary has said he discussed with Trump. In the past, Microsoft Corp. had sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company.One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app — with different branding — to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It’s not clear how effective such a move would be.One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world’s richest person with businesses that straddle the world’s two largest economies.

Chinese trade surplus soars to $1 trillion on pre-Trump exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-trade-surplus-soars-to-1-trillion-on-pre-trump-exports/articleshow/117189744.cms,"A truck loaded with vehicles moves to lines of vehicles for export at a port in Yantai in eastern China's Shandong province.

What Bloomberg economics says...

“Looking ahead to the coming months, we expect the tariff-driven front-loading will continue to boost exports, similar to the trend seen during the first

US-China trade war

.”

David Qu, economist

China’s trade surplus soared last year to a record as companies rushed to get goods out the door to make up for sluggish demand at home and ahead of the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House.The surplus was an unprecedented $992 billion in 2024, according to a statement from the customs administration on Monday. That was 21% higher than the previous year and was driven by record exports and weak imports.The value of shipments rose almost every month last year, pushing it above the 2022 highs during the pandemic. Strong demand from overseas has helped provide growth for a domestic economy that has struggled due to a continuing housing crisis and weak consumption, although that support now faces external challenges.Exports rose almost 11% to $336 billion in December, the second-highest month on record and behind only December 2021, when Chinese firms saw a surge of pandemic-led demand. Outbound shipments for the whole of last year were worth $3.6 trillion.Imports rose 1% last month and 1.1% for the whole year.This may be one of the last high points for Chinese trade, at least directly with the US, with Trump promising to impose even higher tariffs on Chinese goods when he takes office next week. Punitive levies may push Chinese firms to divert their exports, flooding other markets with cheap goods and widening trade tensions.“Exporters likely anticipated potential trade war to happen in 2025 and pushed delivery to avoid higher tariff down the road,” said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. “The key issue to watch is the policies from Washington DC in coming weeks, and the policy reactions from Beijing.”Exports to the US rose to the highest in more than two years in December, hitting almost $49 billion and taking the total for the year to $525 billion.Despite shipping record amounts of goods, Chinese exporters have been getting less money for their products, with export prices falling for more than a year as deflation inside China worsens and pushes down the cost of goods. The result is that the growth in the volume of Chinese trade has outpaced value, with total export volumes rising 7.3% through November according to the Ministry of Transport, faster than the 5.4% rise in values.That can be seen in Shanghai port, which last year became the first anywhere in the world to handle the equivalent of more than 50 million 20-foot shipping containers. The port processed 51.5 million boxes last year, almost 5% more than in 2023 and 19% more than in 2019, the year before the pandemic.",China’s trade surplus soared last year to a record as companies rushed to get goods out the door.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Gold Stance: Sideways to lower

Gold Price Range: Rs 96,000 – 98,000, break below lower range could take prices to Rs 94,000.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold prices are expected to continue being volatile in the near future on the back of uncertainties regarding US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, the approaching July 9 deadline, possible trade deals, and the fresh threat of additional 10% tariffs on BRICS countries that align with ‘anti-American policies’. Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial services Ltd shares his outlook on gold prices and strategy for gold investors:Gold prices saw notable fluctuations over the last week, ultimately settling near a six-week low amid easing global tensions and shifting investor sentiment. The softening of US-China trade hostilities, including agreements on rare earth shipments, dampened safe-haven demand for gold.On other hand, a tentative Iran-Israel ceasefire and Trump’s tariff reprieve on multiple countries also reduced geopolitical risk premiums. Despite the US dollar weakening to its lowest in over three years, gold prices were weighed down by stronger-than-expected US nonfarm payroll data and mixed labour market signals, which cast doubt on near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts. President Trump intensified his push for lower rates, even sending annotated global rate comparisons to Fed Chair Powell, though Powell maintained a cautious ""wait and see"" stance.Political developments added further complexity: Senate Republicans passed Trump’s aggressive tax-and-spending bill, while trade negotiations also picked up pace over the weekend. US is close to finalizing several trade agreements in the coming days and will notify other countries of higher tariff rates by July 9, President Trump mentioned over the weekend, with higher rates scheduled to take effect on August 1.President Trump’s tariff decision on BRICS nation will also be important to keep an eye on. Elsewhere, the first session of indirect Hamas-Israel ceasefire talks in Qatar ended inconclusively, adding that Israeli delegation didn't have a sufficient mandate to reach an agreement with Hamas. The USDINR hovered just below 86, influencing domestic prices. With the FOMC minutes and tariff deadlines approaching, market attention remains sharply focused on Fed policy cues and global trade dynamics.","Gold prices saw notable fluctuations over the last week, ultimately settling near a six-week low.

India-US Mini Trade Deal Soon?



India-US trade deal: India and the United States are close to finalising a limited trade agreement, with officials confirming that sensitive sectors like dairy and agriculture are expected to be left out of the current arrangement.Intense discussions are underway between both countries to finalise a mini trade deal before the Donald Trump administration's 90-day reciprocal tariff suspension concludes on July 9.In April, the United States President Donald Trump declared matching tariffs for most US trading partners, calculated on their trade surpluses with America, incorporating a 26% duty on India.Also Read | ‘India has drawn its red lines…’: Ahead of Donald Trump’s tariff deadline, officials say ‘ball in US court’ on trade deal; here’s what’s happening The Indian government seeks complete withdrawal of the 26% tariff, whilst America demands broader market entry across industries, including agricultural and dairy sectors, along with permission to export genetically modified crops to India.""The deal is in its conclusion phase,"" said an official.

As of now, they seem to be out of the ambit of this phase of the deal,"" the official told ET, adding that the agreement could be announced in the next two days.A second official confirmed that the mini trade deal would specifically address trade in goods. The source told the financial daily that both countries might proceed with additional agreements in future as various matters reach resolution.India aims to secure enhanced market opportunities in the US for its workforce-driven sectors, particularly textiles and electronics.

"UAE rolls out new golden visa: Lifetime residency at Rs 23 lakh, India among first to benefit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/uae-rolls-out-new-golden-visa-lifetime-residency-at-rs-23-lakh-india-among-first-to-benefit/articleshow/122280940.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major shift from its traditional investment-based residency model, the United Arab Emirates has introduced a new nomination-based Golden Visa, offering eligible Indians lifetime residency in the country by paying a one-time fee of AED 1,00,000 (approximately Rs 23.3 lakh), without the need to invest in property or business.Until now, Indian nationals were eligible for the UAE's coveted Golden Visa primarily through high-value investments, including a minimum AED 2 million (Rs 4.66 crore) in property. But under this new system, applicants can be nominated and approved based on their professional background, societal contributions, or potential benefits to UAE’s sectors such as culture, trade, science, startups, or finance.The pilot phase of the initiative has been launched for India and Bangladesh, with over 5,000 Indian applicants expected in the first three months, according to officials involved in the process.Rayad Group, the consultancy firm selected to pilot the nomination-based Golden Visa in India, is leading the process in partnership with VFS and One Vasco centres across India and Bangladesh. Applications can also be submitted through the group’s online portal and call centre.""This is a golden opportunity for Indians,"" said Rayad Kamal Ayub, Managing Director of Rayad Group. He explained that the vetting process includes anti-money laundering checks, criminal background verification, and social media screening.The final nomination decision rests with UAE government authorities.Approved visa holders can bring family members, employ staff, and engage in business or professional activities. Unlike property-based visas, which lapse upon property sale, the nomination-based Golden Visa is permanent.This initiative reflects the UAE’s growing economic and strategic ties with India following the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) signed in 2022. The program is expected to expand to other CEPA partner countries, including China, in later phases.Commenting on the move, Akash Puri, Director International, India Sotheby's International Realty said, “The recent overhaul of the UAE’s Golden Visa marks a significant shift in the country’s residency landscape. The new framework is more inclusive and strategically aligned with the UAE’s long-term vision. For Indian real estate investors, this change brings a two-pronged impact: Historically, property investment was one of the few avenues to secure long-term residency, prompting a surge of interest from Indian investors seeking both capital preservation and immigration benefits. With the visa now accessible through broader channels, the urgency to invest solely for residency purposes is likely to ease—particularly in the mid-market and entry-level segments. This could cool speculative buying and encourage more grounded investment behaviour.”“Investors who remain committed to the UAE property market—driven by rental yields, lifestyle advantages, or diversification—will now place greater emphasis on fundamentals like location, developer credibility, and long-term value. Luxury and trophy assets will continue to appeal to ultra-HNWIs, who are largely unaffected by the new professional-centric criteria. For Indian investors, this is a cue to recalibrate: from residency-led transactions to value-led strategies. Over time, this evolution could establish a more stable, resilient real estate market—one that rewards strategic, long-term participation over short-term speculation.” Akash Puri said.","The pilot phase of the initiative has been launched for India and Bangladesh. Over 5,000 Indian applicants expected in the first three months. Unlike property-based visas, which lapse upon property sale, the nomination-based Golden Visa is permanent.

French IT services firm Capgemini, which has more than half of its 3.4 lakh employees in India, is acquiring one of the country's business process management (BPM) pioneers, WNS, for $3.3 billion. The move is seen as an attempt to bring strong technology expertise, especially AI, into BPM services to be able to offer enterprises much more comprehensive solutions.This acquisition comes a decade after Capgemini acquired Igate, another India-based IT company, for $4 billion.

However, those who file ITR-2 or ITR-3 have not yet been able to start the process of ITR filing since the utilities have not yet been released online (incometax.gov.in) or offline by the tax department.However, taxpayers have little reason to worry since this year the Income Tax Department has extended the deadline to file ITR from July 31 to September 15, 2025. Experts expect the ITR-2 and ITR-3 forms to be released soon.E xperts are of the view that the extensive changes in the Income Tax Return forms and the complexity of ITR-2 and ITR-3 has possibly caused the delay in release from the Income Tax Department’s end.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader People Advisory Services - Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR-2 / ITR-3 return forms are applicable for individuals with complex financial profiles such as income from multiple house properties, capital gains, foreign assets and foreign income, business or professional income (in the case of ITR-3), directorships, unlisted equity shares, total income exceeding INR 5 million, brought forward and carry forward of losses, etc.Also Read | Income Tax Return e-filing: Can you keep switching between new and old tax regime every year? What taxpayers should know “These forms are significantly more detailed than the simpler ITR-1/ ITR-4 forms. The delay in releasing the e-filing utility (online and offline) for ITR-2 / ITR-3 can be attributed to the substantive changes introduced in the return forms such as separate reporting of capital gains earned before and after 23 July 2024, detailed reporting of deductions / exemptions, reporting of TDS section codes, etc,” Sonu Iyer tells TOI.According to the EY tax expert, such changes require comprehensive technical modifications to align the utility with the enhanced reporting requirements and provisions of the Finance Act, 2024.The Income Tax Department has extended the deadline for filing returns to 15 September 2025 recognizing the time required to update the utilities and the time required for system readiness,” she adds.* Salary/pension earnings* Revenue from multiple residential properties* Any amount of capital gains* Overseas income or assets* Agricultural proceeds exceeding Rs.5,000* Those with RNOR/NRI status* Company directors or holders of unlisted equity* Cases involving combined spousal incomePersons earning from business or professional activitiesExcel-based utility now accommodates revised return submissions under Section 139(8A).Also Read | ITR e-filing AY 2025-25: What is Annual Information Statement (AIS) and how is it different from Form 26AS?

Scholar Before Stateswoman



Prime Minister Narendra Modi met his Indian roots Trinidad and Tobago counterpart Kamla Persad-Bissessar on Friday (Thursday in T&T) and called her “Bihar ki Beti” (daughter of Bihar), spotlighting her ancestral roots in Bihar’s Buxar district.While addressing a community event during PM Modi's visit, Bissessar praised PM Modi and recited his poem from his book 'Aankh Aa Dhanya Chhe'.Kamla Persad-Bissessar is the first woman to serve as Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean nation. Born on April 4, 1952, in Siparia, southern Trinidad, she has also held the positions of Attorney General and leader of the opposition, becoming the first woman in the country to hold each of these roles. According to her official profile on the World Economic Forum, she has been the political leader of the united national congress (UNC) since January 2010.Before entering national politics, Persad-Bissessar served as an alderman and later made her way to Parliament as the representative from Siparia in 1995. Over the years, she held several cabinet positions, including Attorney General, Minister of Legal Affairs, and Minister of Education.Kamla Persad-Bissessar has deep ancestral ties to India — more specifically, to Bhelupur village in Bihar’s Buxar district. In 2012, she visited her village during a private trip and called it one of the most emotional moments of her life. Welcomed with traditional Bihari folk songs, flower garlands, and heartfelt celebrations, she had told the villagers: “I feel I’ve come home.”Her contributions have not only earned her acclaim in Trinidad and Tobago but also recognition in India. In 2012, she was conferred the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman — the highest honour for overseas Indians — by then President Pratibha Patil, acknowledging her outstanding leadership and her efforts in strengthening India-Trinidad ties.Kamla Persad-Bissessar earned a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma in Education from the University of the West Indies, followed by a law degree from Hugh Wooding Law School, where she was ranked top of her class.She later completed an Executive MBA from the Arthur Lok Jack Graduate School of Business in Trinidad in 2006.Before stepping into politics, Persad-Bissessar spent over six years in academics — teaching at the University of the West Indies, St Andrew High School in Jamaica, and serving as a Consultant Lecturer at the Jamaica College of Insurance. She also worked as a social worker with the Church of England Children's Society in London, combining compassion with intellect long before entering Parliament.","Kamla Persad-Bissessar is the first woman to serve as Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean nation.

Asian equity markets inched higher on Tuesday as investor sentiment improved slightly following US President Donald Trump's remarks suggesting room for negotiations on newly announced tariff hikes.Meanwhile, oil prices steadied after Monday’s surge, with traders assessing the combined impact of trade uncertainties and a surprise output move by OPEC+.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index posted modest gains, supported by advances in Japanese and South Korean equities, both rising as much as 0.3%.The uptick came after Trump softened his stance on sharply higher tariffs targeting key partners like Japan, South Korea and Malaysia, saying the notifications were “not 100% firm,” according to Bloomberg.He also delayed their implementation until August 1, hinting at the possibility of further extensions or last-minute deals.“This is carrot and stick play – stretch the deadline, tighten the grip, and remain focused on a deal to be made,” said Hebe Chen, who’s a market analyst at Vantage Markets, Melbourne.As per Bloomberg, despite the drama, she further said that the market is still pricing in the likelihood of a resolution within weeks.The newly announced levies include 25% duties on goods from Japan, South Korea and Malaysia, with even steeper rates on others — up to 40% on Laos and Myanmar.Yet, global equities have rebounded from their April lows, buoyed by hopes that bilateral deals might be struck before the new measures take effect.India, which is also in negotiations with Washington, has reportedly made its final offer. Officials cited by Bloomberg say that New Delhi is firm on its red lines, resisting US demands to open up its dairy and auto sectors or allow genetically modified crop imports.In currencies, the yen edged higher after Monday's sharp fall, while the US dollar slightly retreated. Still, confidence in the dollar remains robust. As quoted by Bloomberg, Wells Fargo strategist Aroop Chatterjee called the recent developments “a perfect storm for a recovery,” as economic data keeps the Federal Reserve on the sidelines.Oil markets, meanwhile, saw a pullback on Tuesday. Brent crude fell 21 cents to $69.37 a barrel, and US WTI slipped 24 cents to $67.69, after climbing nearly 2% the day before.As per Reuters, investors remain cautious amid trade jitters and news that OPEC+ will raise output by 548,000 barrels per day in August, a higher hike than previous months.Although OPEC+ agreed to phase out most of its voluntary 2.2 million bpd cuts, actual increases have mostly come from Saudi Arabia. As per Reuters, Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect a final 550,000 bpd boost for September when the bloc meets again on August 3.Despite the broader concerns, demand signals remain firm, especially in the US. A record 72.2 million Americans were expected to travel for the July 4 holiday, helping to support oil consumption.Investor bullishness was also reflected in CFTC data showing net-long positions in crude rising in the week to July 1.Still, “investors should be alert to headline risk,” cautioned Fawad Razaqzada of City Index and Forex.com, as cited by Bloomberg, underlining that while talks may resume, the threat of renewed volatility remains high.","US President Donald Trump softened his stance on sharply higher tariffs targeting key partners like Japan, South Korea and Malaysia.

While the new nomination-based UAE Golden Visa model for Indians has drawn widespread attention for offering lifetime residency at a one-time cost of AED 1,00,000 (approx. Rs 23.3 lakh), the process isn’t as simple as just paying the fee. Not everyone with the money qualifies automatically, according to the official UAE government website.The UAE’s Golden Visa is a long-term residence permit that allows foreign nationals to live, work, or study in the Emirates. Benefits include a 5- or 10-year renewable visa, multiple-entry options, no sponsor requirement, the ability to stay outside the UAE for extended periods, and full sponsorship rights for family and domestic help.However, eligibility criteria differ depending on the applicant’s background—be it investment, talent, entrepreneurship, or academics. For example, investors must either place AED 2 million in a UAE-accredited fund or own qualifying real estate of similar value. Additionally, they must submit proof of medical insurance and verify that the capital is not loaned.Despite the introduction of a nomination-based model that appears to reduce the investment barrier, eligibility remains strictly controlled and approval is not guaranteed merely by paying the fee.

Any nation backing Brics will face 10% extra tariff: Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/any-nation-backing-brics-will-face-10-extra-tariff-donald-trump/articleshow/122305764.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

US President Donald Trump on Monday decided to impose 25% reciprocal tariffs on Japan and South Korea - almost the same as those announced in April.He provided notice of the tariffs, beginning Aug 1, by posting letters on social media addressed to political heads of both the countries.This followed Trump's warning earlier in the day that any country aligning themselves with ""anti-American policies"" of Brics would be slapped with an extra 10% tariff.At the time of going to press, Trump also announced tariffs on five more countries with the new rate for three lower than the April 2 reciprocal rates. Myanmar dropped from 44% to 40%, Laos from 48% to 40% and Kazakhstan from 27% to 25%. South Africa stayed at 30% and Malaysia increased by 1 percentage point to 25% (similar to Japan).While Indian officials have not given up on the expectation of a ""mini-trade deal"", despite their stated reluctance on lowering duties on agricultural goods such as soybean, maize and dairy products, Monday's tariff announcements could be a pointer to Trump imposing 26% duty on all Indian exports to US in case he is not convinced about the arrangement worked out at the official level last week.But given commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal’s statement on the Centre’s intent to keep national interest and farmer’s interests paramount, there is little elbow space for negotiations on this front.That leaves products such as apples and pecan nuts on which India can lower tariffs for American imports, in addition to automobiles and whiskey.US has indicated that it is unwilling to lower duties below the 10% baseline levy and also wants to retain sectoral tariffs of 50% on iron and steel products and 25% on auto parts. Exporters and businesses have worked out an arrangement where 6-7% of the baseline tariff is split between them and the rest is passed on to consumers.","US President Donald Trump on Monday decided to impose 25% reciprocal tariffs on Japan and South Korea.

China's rare earth exports clampdown: Curbs backfire as local magnet makers reel from demand collapse; revenues plunge and inventories pile up despite US deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-rare-earth-exports-clampdown-curbs-backfire-as-local-magnet-makers-reel-from-demand-collapse-revenues-plunge-and-inventories-pile-up-despite-us-deal/articleshow/122303856.cms,"Share prices rebound, but outlook remains grim

Industry braces for long disruption and possible shakeout

China’s export restrictions on rare earths have disrupted the global auto supply chain, forced production halts by carmakers, and pushed US President Donald Trump back to the negotiating table—but at home, the curbs have dealt a fresh blow to struggling Chinese magnet makers.Beijing imposed the restrictions in April in retaliation for US tariffs, severely impacting rare earth and magnet exports just as the domestic economy shows signs of weakness. Electric vehicles (EVs), a key end-use sector, are already facing headwinds, compounding the pain for magnet producers.According to a Reuters report, magnet exports plunged 75% in the two months following the export controls, and several global automakers were forced to pause production. Although the US and China announced a deal on June 27 to restart rare earth trade flows, implementation is expected to take time.In a post on WeChat just 12 hours after the deal was announced, the state-backed Baotou Rare Earth Products Exchange said inventory was piling up in warehouses and warned that the damage would not be reversed quickly.The Baotou exchange, located in Inner Mongolia—one of China’s major rare earth hubs—described the impact in May as a “crisis” for domestic magnet producers.Despite China producing 90% of the world’s rare earth magnets, export sales remain critical. In 2024, overseas sales accounted for between 18% and 50% of total revenue for the 11 largest publicly listed magnet firms, Reuters reported, citing public filings.“Their sales are now being squeezed from both ends – disrupted exports and flagging domestic demand,” said Ellie Saklatvala, head of metal pricing at commodities information firm Argus. “They have temporarily lost an important part of their customer base, with no certainty about when they will regain it.”Two rare earth magnet producers told Reuters that revenue is expected to fall in 2025, though they declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. One producer said the export curbs would have a “huge impact” on business, while small- and mid-sized players have already slashed production by around 15% in April and May, according to another source.Much like US chipmaker Nvidia, Chinese rare earth firms are caught in the middle of geopolitical crossfire. After an initial share price crash in April, some listed magnet producers have bounced back—but analysts caution the rebound is not backed by industry fundamentals.“I can see various market outlooks, more or less negative depending on the assumptions, but none of them yield a sustainable rise in share price like we’re seeing,” said Cory Combs, head of critical minerals research at Trivium China. He added that many players in the industry are private, limiting the insight that stock prices can offer.Magnet manufacturers are also under pressure at home due to a brutal EV price war, with automakers demanding price cuts from component suppliers. Complicating matters further is the customised nature of most magnet products, which makes them hard to resell domestically. Four sources told Reuters that producers are being forced to store unsold cargoes while they await export licences.Some companies have acknowledged the strain. Baotou Tianhe Magnetics Technology Co flagged potential export revenue risks in its annual report published in late April. Yantai Zhenghai Magnetics said last week that it had received export licences and operations were running normally, while deferring financial details to upcoming filings.However, analysts warn that rare earth trade flows are unlikely to return to pre-restriction levels any time soon.“Looking at China’s recent export controls on other critical minerals – such as antimony – it is clear that it can sometimes take longer than expected for exports to resume and normalise,” said Argus’ Saklatvala, quoted Reuters.China imposed similar export restrictions on germanium and antimony across 2023 and 2024. Despite being mostly used in civilian sectors, which theoretically face fewer licensing hurdles, exports have yet to fully recover, customs data shows. Europe, for instance, is now receiving only a fraction of the antimony it once imported from China, leading to shortages for lead-acid battery manufacturers.David Abraham, an affiliate professor at Boise State University, said the export licence process now involves extensive documentation, leading to delays and added costs. “In some sense, there’s no going back,” he said.With the industry consisting of hundreds of manufacturers, the growing pressures could spark consolidation. “I do not know if Beijing sees that as a bad thing, because further consolidation is helpful for controlling and understanding where materials go,” Abraham added.","China's export restrictions on rare earths have disrupted the global auto supply chain, forced production halts by carmakers, and pushed US President Donald Trump back to the negotiating table.

Trump imposes 25% tariffs on Japan and South Korea

The Trump administration is not expected to immediately impose a 10% tariff on Brics nations, despite earlier threats from President Donald Trump warning of trade penalties for countries embracing “anti-American policies”.According to a source familiar with the matter, cited by Reuters, the administration will reserve the option to activate the additional tariff only if specific nations within the bloc take steps seen as directly hostile to US interests.“A line is being drawn. If policy decisions are made that are anti-American, then the tariff will be charged,” the source told Reuters.The President’s warning came late Sunday on Truth Social, amid tense negotiations between the US and several Brics nations ahead of a July 9 deadline, when earlier tariff waivers are set to expire. India and Indonesia, both Brics members, are reportedly involved in last-minute efforts to reach trade deals before that date.“Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of Brics will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff,” Trump posted. “There will be no exceptions to this policy.”The comments have sparked strong international responses. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa condemned the tariff threat as “disappointing,” arguing Brics is not aimed at undermining any other country.“There should never be vengeance… against countries that are seeking to cooperate together,” he said during an interview with South Africa’s SABC.In a joint statement released at the Rio de Janeiro summit, Brics finance ministers and central bank governors criticised the unilateral imposition of tariffs and trade measures. The bloc expressed concern over practices that “distort trade and are inconsistent with WTO rules,” pledging to uphold a “rules-based multilateral trading system.”US President Trump sent out his first letters announcing a new 25% tariff on goods imported from Japan and South Korea, citing persistent trade imbalances with the key Asian allies.The letters, posted Monday on Truth Social and addressed to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, warned against retaliation: “If for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 25% that we charge.”","Trump administration not expected to immediately impose a 10% tariff on Brics nations.

As his public feud with President Trump intensifies and his political value to Beijing diminishes, Musk finds himself caught in a geopolitical squeeze with potentially existential stakes for Tesla.

Since January this year, Musk has been a prized figure in both capitals: a symbol of innovation in China’s booming EV sector and a direct line to the White House under Trump.

But today, he’s politically isolated in Washington, increasingly outpaced in Shanghai, and facing waning influence in both.

Tesla’s growth engine is stalling-and the political winds that once pushed it forward are now turning against it. Trump’s tax reforms have stripped billions in subsidies that once boosted Tesla. Meanwhile, China has elevated domestic EV rivals like BYD and Xiaomi, relegating Tesla to the sidelines in a market it once helped ignite.

Tesla’s future as a global EV leader hinges on how Musk navigates these dual breakdowns. Neither Trump nor Chinese President Xi has publicly written him off, but both are now making moves that sideline Musk’s once-central role.

The big picture

Between the lines

As per the WSJ article, ""Because of the Musk-Trump feud, Beijing no longer views the Tesla chief executive as a geopolitical asset and will shy away from publicly courting him, the people said.""

What they’re saying

“You never want to bet against Elon Musk and the resilience of Tesla,” Michael Dunne, a former GM executive, told the WSJ. “But he knows there’s a shelf life for foreign companies in China. He’s probably closer to sunset than sunup there.”

Bill Russo, CEO of Shanghai-based Automobility, put it more bluntly: “Musk made the classic mistake foreign automakers make-underestimating China’s ability to out-innovate.”

Even inside Tesla, some fear that Musk’s refusal to localize more products or cede control is alienating crucial allies. “Tesla remains important to China,” said a China adviser to WSJ. “But for authorities, helping domestic companies still matters more.”

What’s next

The bottom line

Tesla shares saw a steep decline among S&P 500 stocks on Monday, after tensions between CEO Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump flared up again over the weekend. Once a key Trump ally and major donor, Musk announced plans to launch a third political party in response to the Republican-backed spending bill passed last week.Musk introduced the “America Party” on Saturday following an escalating clash with Trump over his tax-cut and spending package.The timing of Musk’s political pivot added to market unease, coming just days after Tesla reported its second consecutive quarterly decline in vehicle deliveries-a sign of mounting pressure from intense competition and an aging product lineup.""Investors are worried about two things – one is more Trump ire affecting subsidies and the other, more importantly, is a distracted Musk,"" said Neil Wilson, UK investor strategist at Saxo Markets.Tesla stock, which peaked in December after Trump’s re-election win, has since dropped 35%, the steepest decline among the so-called “Magnificent Seven” group of high-growth US tech giants.Tesla is no longer the darling it once was. In the US, Tesla’s vehicle sales are sliding fast. Deliveries dropped 21% in Q2, according to Cox Automotive, marking the second consecutive year of decline.Tesla’s market share of US EV sales has plummeted from over 75% in 2022 to under 50% as of 2024. Even in California, a deep-blue stronghold for EV adoption, Tesla registrations dropped for four straight quarters-much of it blamed on Musk’s polarizing politics.In China, the world’s largest EV market, Tesla is being squeezed even harder. May sales dropped 30% year-over-year, and its market share in the EV and plug-in hybrid category fell to just 4%, down from 11% in 2021, per China Passenger Car Association data. By contrast, BYD commands a dominant 29% of the market.As per a WSJ report, Tesla’s competitive edge is eroding, and fast. Chinese consumers now favor flashier, cheaper, and more tech-savvy cars from domestic brands. Features like in-car refrigerators, multiple screens, selfie cameras, and instant smartphone syncing-once afterthoughts-have become must-haves.Musk’s troubles in China go beyond sales figures-they’re rooted in trust, regulatory red tape, and shifting strategic value.For years, Beijing treated Tesla as a catalyst-offering cheap land, tax breaks, and a first-mover advantage in a bid to jumpstart its own EV ecosystem. It worked. Local firms studied Tesla’s playbook and leapfrogged. Now, with the mission accomplished, China no longer needs to elevate Musk as a figurehead.And Musk hasn’t helped his own case. Despite direct meetings with Premier Li Qiang and Vice President Han Zheng, Chinese regulators still haven’t greenlit Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. Officials say the AI-based system-trained mostly on US road data-poses national security and safety risks. Tesla’s workaround attempts, including limited over-the-air updates, were slapped down. Regulators even accused the company of using Chinese drivers as “guinea pigs” without proper clearance.Tesla’s China team has repeatedly warned headquarters about lagging product appeal and feature gaps. Yet internal pleas to localize more functions-like integrating Chinese voice assistants or building a distinctly Chinese Tesla-were mostly dismissed. As a result, Musk’s once-iconic cars now appear outdated in China’s fast-evolving market, the WSJ report said.Musk's public spat with Trump has further eroded his utility for the Chinese dispensation.Musk’s feud with Trump is further complicating Tesla’s path forward.Musk once held rare influence in Trump’s Washington, heading DOGE -a federal efficiency task force - and securing green-energy incentives that became vital to Tesla’s bottom line. But that alliance shattered after Trump’s $5 trillion tax and spending bill, which gutted EV subsidies and regulatory credits. Musk blasted the legislation as “insane,” then retaliated by announcing a third political party-the “America Party”-to challenge Trump’s allies in Congress.Trump hit back, calling Musk’s move “ridiculous,” while threatening Tesla’s government contracts and subsidies. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent warned Musk to “focus on business, not politics.” Investors echoed the concern, with Azoria Partners delaying a Tesla ETF over doubts about Musk’s divided attention.As per the WSJ report, many analysts expect Tesla’s future in China to remain rocky. US companies often enjoy early success in China, only to be overtaken as domestic competitors gain scale and the state gradually shifts support toward homegrown firms.Motorola offers a cautionary tale: in the early 2000s, the company lost its foothold after Chinese rivals, backed by state policies, pushed it to share proprietary technology and comply with battery standards set by Huawei Technologies.Apple, once the top smartphone seller in China as recently as 2023, has since fallen to third place behind Huawei and another Chinese brand offering more features at lower prices. Its decline has been made worse by official curbs on iPhone use among government employees and a wave of policies boosting local manufacturers, the WSJ report added.In the US, Musk faces political headwinds from both parties. With Trump’s administration targeting Tesla’s revenue streams and Democrats disillusioned by Musk’s rhetoric, Tesla is without a natural political champion.Tesla’s dominance is no longer guaranteed-and Musk’s political star is dimming on both ends of the Pacific. Xi doesn’t need Musk anymore. Trump has turned on him. As Tesla bleeds market share and fumbles innovation, the company’s fate may depend less on technology and more on whether Musk can win back favor in two capitals that increasingly view him as a liability, not an asset.(With inputs from agencies)","Tesla's growth engine is stalling-and the political winds that once pushed it forward are now turning against it.

US trade threat: Donald Trump warns Brics nations of 10% tariff hike; bloc slams US trade policies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-trade-threat-donald-trump-warns-brics-nations-of-10-tariff-hike-bloc-slams-us-trade-policies/articleshow/122301584.cms,"Tariff pressure mounts ahead of August 1

China defends Brics stance

US President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to impose an additional 10% import tariff on China, India, and other Brics nations after the 11-member grouping criticised his trade policies during their summit in Brazil.“Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of Brics, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy,” Trump said in a post on social media. His remarks came after Brics leaders denounced the US tariff regime as “indiscriminate”, “damaging”, and “illegal” in their joint statement on Sunday.The Brics bloc — which includes China, India, Brazil, Russia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and Indonesia — accounts for nearly half the world’s population and about 40% of global economic output. Once envisioned as a forum for fast-growing emerging markets, the expanded Brics now brings together both US adversaries such as Iran and Russia, and Washington's allies, including Saudi Arabia and Indonesia.While some US-aligned members sought to moderate the criticism by avoiding Trump’s name in the joint declaration, it did little to placate the White House. Saudi Arabia, a key buyer of US weapons, went so far as to withdraw its foreign minister from Sunday’s session and the official Brics “family photo”, AFP reported.Trump’s renewed tariff threat comes ahead of an August 1 deadline, by which the administration has demanded new trade deals from global partners or face sweeping unilateral duties. The Brics nations now appear likely to be targeted for steeper penalties.The latest backlash also follows a Brics statement condemning US and Israeli airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure — a move seen as bolstering member state Iran amid rising Middle East tensions.China rejected accusations that the Brics platform was hostile to the United States. “China has repeatedly stated its position that trade and tariff wars have no winners, and protectionism offers no way forward,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning in a briefing on Monday.“Brics is not targeted at any country,” Mao added, calling the bloc an “important platform for cooperation between emerging markets and developing countries.”The summit’s momentum appeared weakened by the absence of key leaders. Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has never missed a Brics summit in 12 years, skipped this year’s event. Russian President Vladimir Putin, wanted by the International Criminal Court over the Ukraine war, joined via video link.Despite the diplomatic strain, Putin told Brics counterparts the group has become a “key player in global governance”, underlining its growing geopolitical weight.","US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 10% import tariff on China, India, and other Brics nations.

Global cues and Fed outlook

US stocks retreated sharply on Monday as escalating tariff threats from President Donald Trump unsettled Wall Street ahead of a key Wednesday deadline. The S&P 500 slid 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 526 points (1.2%) and the Nasdaq lost 1% in midday trading.All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 traded in the red, with tech and consumer stocks leading the decline, while Tesla shares plunged 6.8%, the biggest drop in the index. The selloff came after CEO Elon Musk reignited his feud with Trump by announcing a new political party to oppose the Republican spending bill passed last week, according to AP.The market mood soured as Trump stepped up pressure on trading partners to strike trade deals before July 10 or face additional tariffs, raising fears of a fresh global trade conflict.“Just bringing back that meaty topic back into focus, after a strong week last week, has given a little bit of a pause in the market,” said Bill Northey, senior investment director at US Bank Asset Management.Trump told reporters that his administration would send letters to several foreign governments laying out new tariff rates unless deals were reached by Wednesday. He said the tariffs would not be collected until August 1, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent denied that date was a firm deadline.The Trump–Musk fallout hit Tesla investors hard. Trump blasted Musk on Sunday, saying the billionaire “had gone off the rails.” Analysts warned that the spat could have long-term consequences for Musk’s companies, which rely heavily on federal subsidies.“With the autonomous future ahead and the AI Revolution in full force, Musk/Tesla do not need to keep poking the bear,” said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, warning that Trump could create regulatory or funding roadblocks.Tesla has already lost 40% since its December 17 peak of $479.76, closing at $289.75, down $26 since Thursday.Monday’s drop followed a strong week where markets hit record highs, buoyed by a better-than-expected US jobs report. But Trump’s renewed tariff rhetoric overshadowed those gains.On Sunday, he warned of an additional 10% tariff on BRICS nations, including China, India, Russia, and South Africa, after the bloc criticised his trade policies at their Rio de Janeiro summit.Nomura analysts said the near-term outlook depends on which countries receive tariff notices, the rates proposed, and when enforcement begins.Last week, Trump struck a trade deal with Vietnam, allowing US goods duty-free access while imposing a 20% levy on Vietnamese exports, down from a previously proposed 46%. Analysts said similar deals could follow for other countries with large trade surpluses.“The Vietnam deal may be a blueprint for similar countries in the region,” said Jason Pride of Glenmede, AP quoted.The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.38% from 4.34%, signalling caution among bond investors. Meanwhile, oil prices climbed after OPEC+ agreed to boost production by 548,000 barrels per day in August.US crude rose 1.2%, and Brent crude gained 1.5%.European indices were mostly higher, while Asian markets closed mixed. The week ahead is light on economic data. The Federal Reserve will release minutes of its last policy meeting on Wednesday, with Chair Jerome Powell expected to hold rates steady until the inflation impact of new tariffs becomes clearer.“The Fed doesn’t want to pre-empt the inflationary effect of these tariffs. It’s a wait-and-watch mode,” one strategist said.With Wall Street now digesting both political risk and tariff volatility, investors are bracing for a rocky trading week.","All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 traded in the red, with tech and consumer stocks leading the decline.

Federal subsidies in spotlight

Politics, perception, and pressure

Tesla shares plunged 8% at the opening bell on Monday after a renewed political spat between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump reignited investor concerns about the electric vehicle maker’s future, particularly its reliance on federal support.The fresh sell-off followed Musk’s weekend announcement that he was forming a third political party, in protest against a recently passed Republican spending bill. Musk, once a prominent Trump ally and donor, claimed the legislation would “kill jobs” and stifle innovation, AP reported.Trump fired back in a social media post on Sunday, saying the billionaire entrepreneur had “gone off the rails” in recent weeks.Investors fear that escalating tensions between Musk and Trump could lead to retaliatory action affecting Tesla, SpaceX, and Musk's other ventures, all of which benefit from US government contracts and subsidies.“With the autonomous future ahead and the AI Revolution in full force, Musk/Tesla do not need to keep poking the bear,” said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, in a client note late Sunday, AP quoted.“Trump can create more hurdles for Musk/Tesla/SpaceX over the coming years if this political battle gets nastier heading into mid-terms in 2026,” he warned.Tesla shares, which peaked at $479.76 on December 17, have lost about 40% of their value since then. Monday’s drop wiped out $26 per share, bringing Tesla’s stock to $289.75, amid broader weakness in European and US markets.Market watchers say Tesla’s share price has been hit by more than just politics. Analysts point to growing global competition in the EV space, especially in China, and a consumer backlash stemming from Musk’s increasingly vocal right-wing affiliations and his ties to controversial groups such as Germany’s AfD.Musk’s alignment with the Trump administration during last year’s campaign and his public political positioning have added fuel to the ongoing volatility, with Tesla’s brand perception taking a hit, particularly among more liberal consumers.As the 2026 midterms approach and Musk steps deeper into political territory, investors are bracing for more uncertainty around Tesla’s trajectory — and possibly more turbulence in the stock.","Tesla shares plunged 8% at the opening bell on Monday after a renewed political spat between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.

French tech giant Capgemini on Monday announced its acquisition of business process services (BPS) provider WNS for $3.3 billion in cash, a strategic move aimed at creating a global leader in AI-powered business operations.As per the news agency AFP, the deal, unanimously approved by both companies’ boards, values WNS at $76.50 per share, a 28 per cent premium over its 90-day average trading price.With this acquisition, Capgemini aims to tap into the fast-evolving demand for agentic AI, or autonomous AI agents, which can independently perform tasks and make decisions in business environments.“Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS will provide the group with the scale and vertical sector expertise to capture that rapidly emerging strategic opportunity created by the paradigm shift from traditional BPS to agentic AI-powered intelligent operations,” said Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat, as cited by AFP.WNS, headquartered in London with a second base in India and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, began in the late 1990s by offering services to British Airways.Today, it caters to clients across various sectors, helping them transition from conventional outsourcing to tech-driven operational models. The company is widely recognised as a key player in the BPS sector, which has evolved from simple back-office outsourcing to complex AI-integrated process management.“Organisations that have already digitised are now seeking to reimagine their operating models by embedding AI at the core, shifting from automation to autonomy,” WNS CEO Keshav Murugesh said, as per AFP.Capgemini, which provides IT consulting and digital transformation services, said the acquisition would open up strong cross-selling opportunities and is expected to immediately enhance its financial performance.The deal is projected to boost earnings per share by 4 per cent in 2026 and by 7 per cent in 2027 once synergies are realised.To fund the acquisition and assume WNS’s existing debt, Capgemini has secured €4 billion ($4.7 billion) in bridge financing, it said in a joint statement with WNS.The transaction reflects a broader industry shift as companies move from AI-assisted automation to building AI-led autonomous operations.","French tech giant Capgemini on Monday announced its acquisition of business process services provider WNS for $3.3 billion in cash.

Asian markets slipped into the red on Monday as fresh confusion over the US tariff policy weighed on investor sentiment, while oil prices extended losses after OPEC+ surprised markets with a bigger-than-expected output hike.Japanese shares shed 0.3%, South Korea’s KOSPI declined 0.7%, and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.1%. US stock futures were also under pressure, with S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures falling 0.3% each.As per Reuters, the weak mood came after US President Donald Trump said the US would notify countries of higher tariff rates by July 9, with new rates taking effect on August 1. Trump had earlier announced a base tariff of 10%, with the possibility of levies going up to 50%.However, little clarity was provided on which nations the new deadlines applied to, adding to investor anxiety.""President Trump’s going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don’t move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level,"" US treasury secretary Scott Bessent told CNN.The uncertainty comes as major US trading partners, including India, Japan, and the EU, are reportedly at critical stages of negotiation.“If reciprocal tariffs are implemented in their original form or even expanded, it will intensify downside risks to US growth and increase upside risks to inflation,” analysts at ANZ warned in a note, as per news agency Reuters.The tariff uncertainty has also kept currency markets subdued. The US dollar index remained near four-year lows at 96.913, while the yen stood at 144.38 per dollar. Safe-haven US Treasuries saw mild buying, with 10-year yields dipping to 4.326%.Oil markets were rattled further after OPEC+ announced on Saturday a surprise production increase of 548,000 barrels per day in August, higher than in previous months. Brent crude fell $0.80, or 1.2%, to $67.50 a barrel, and US WTI dropped $1.32 to $65.68 per barrel in early trade, as per Reuters.""The increased production clearly represents a more aggressive competition for market share and some tolerance for the resulting decline in price and revenue,"" said Tim Evans of Evans Energy, as quoted by Reuters.OPEC+ also signalled another potential hike in September, with analysts from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan warning this could lead to a crude surplus later in the year. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, raised its August price for Arab Light crude to a four-month high for Asian buyers, indicating confidence in demand.As per Bloomberg, despite current tightness in the oil market, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo cautioned that ""rising risks like ongoing trade tensions"" could weaken the outlook over the next 6–12 months.Adding to geopolitical uncertainty, China imposed procurement restrictions on EU-based medical device firms, complicating its attempts to ease trade tensions with the US.","Japanese shares shed 0.3%, South Korea's KOSPI declined 0.7%, and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.1%.

But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge. The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-104558088,imgsize-2534,width-400,resizemode-4/SISIRRADAR.jpg"

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

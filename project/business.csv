US stocks closed with mixed results as the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, which affected numerous countries, was relatively subdued in global markets. The S&P 500 dipped by 0.1% after nearing its all-time high earlier in the day. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 224 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite increased by 0.3%, reaching a new record.The S&P 500 experienced a slight decline of 0.1% after momentarily nearing its all-time high earlier in the day. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 224 points, or 0.5%, while the Nasdaq composite saw a 0.3% increase, reaching a new record.Concerns are mounting that President Trump's tariffs are negatively impacting the economy, especially following last week's disappointing job market report. However, optimism surrounding potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and a series of unexpectedly strong profit reports from major U.S. companies are helping to alleviate some of these worries, at least temporarily. Lower interest rates can stimulate the economy and boost investment prices, although they also carry the risk of increasing inflation. In a similar move, the Bank of England reduced its main interest rate on Thursday in an effort to support the struggling U.K.economy.The S&P 500 rose 0.5% in early trading, hovering just below its all-time high set last month while Dow gained 200 points and Nasdaq climbed 1%.However, the market eventually plunged into red as DJIA was dipped 355 points or 0.8%, trading at 43,837. Nasdaq followed the suit, falling to 21,157, shredding 0.06% or 12 points.Trump's new tariffs, which took effect Thursday morning, are seen as part of an ongoing trade push that has rattled markets and policymakers globally. Some nations are still in talks to reduce the tax rates on their exports, but for now, uncertainty remains the only constant on Wall Street.On Thursday, the Bank of England cut its main interest rate in an effort to support the struggling UK economy.The latest round of US tariffs, which came into effect on Thursday morning, were already expected and turned out to be lower than Trump had initially warned. Several countries are still trying to negotiate lower tax rates on their exports, while uncertainty continues to loom large on Wall Street.The latest reports on the US economy painted a mixed picture, keeping Treasury yields largely steady in the bond market.One report showed a slight rise in the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week. While this may hint at an increase in layoffs, the figure still falls within its usual range.","The S&P 500 experienced a slight decline of 0.1% after momentarily nearing its all-time high earlier in the day.

Gold and silver price prediction today: Gold rates have been exhibiting bullish momentum in the domestic market. What levels of gold and silver prices should investors watch out for? Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group shares his views:MCX Gold prices have been trading significantly above the ₹1,00,000 mark, indicating strong bullish momentum in the domestic market. The precious metal has shown resilience, maintaining its upward trend, and is now expected to move towards ₹1,02,000 in the near term, with the potential to test ₹1,03,000 levels during the week. The immediate support for MCX Gold lies at ₹98,500, which is a key level to watch. As long as prices hold above this support, the bullish outlook remains intact. Investor sentiment continues to be supported by global uncertainties and steady demand for safe-haven assets.On the international front, Comex Gold is currently trading around $3,370 and is undergoing a phase of consolidation after recent gains. A decisive move above the $3,390 resistance level would likely trigger further upside momentum, potentially opening the path for higher targets. The international gold market is closely monitoring economic data, interest rate expectations, and geopolitical developments, all of which could act as catalysts for the next leg of movement.Overall, both domestic and global gold prices are reflecting strong bullish undertones, and traders should keep an eye on the key resistance and support levels for confirmation of continued momentum.MCX Silver has recently given a bullish breakout, signaling renewed strength in the precious metal. This breakout indicates a strong possibility of prices climbing back towards the ₹1,17,000 mark in the near term. The momentum is supported by buying interest at lower levels and overall bullish sentiment in the metals market. Technically, the price action suggests that silver is poised for a fresh upward move, provided it sustains above key support levels.The immediate support lies at ₹1,10,600, which is a critical level to watch. As long as prices remain above this support, the bullish trend is expected to continue. Any pullbacks towards this zone could attract fresh buying. A sustained move above recent highs could further strengthen the rally, bringing higher levels into focus.Globally, silver prices are also being supported by increased industrial demand and safe-haven buying amid ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainties. The gold-silver ratio is narrowing, which also points to relatively stronger performance in silver compared to gold. Traders and investors should monitor global cues, especially from the U.S. economy, for further direction. Overall, MCX Silver appears well-positioned for further gains, and a move toward ₹1,17,000 could materialize if current momentum holds.","MCX Gold prices have been trading significantly above the ₹1,00,000 mark, indicating strong bullish momentum in the domestic market.

Stock market recommendations: According to Bajaj Broking Research, JSW Energy, and Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for August 8, 2025:Benchmark indices experienced high volatility with a corrective bias, as investor sentiment turned cautious following US President Donald Trump’s executive order imposing an additional 25% import tariff on Indian goods. The action, prompted by India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, raises total US duties on certain Indian exports to 50%—among the steepest tariffs ever imposed on a trade partner by the US.Technically, the index has strong support in the 24,400–24,500 range. This zone aligns with multiple key indicators, including the previous swing low, the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), and a key Fibonacci retracement level of the recent uptrend.As long as Nifty holds above this support area, the ongoing consolidation phase between 24,400 and 25,000 is expected to remain intact. However, a decisive break below 24,400 may extend the current month-long correction towards the 200-day EMA near the 24,200 level in the sessions ahead.Currently, the 5% decline over the past five weeks has dragged weekly stochastic oscillators into oversold territory (reading near 5).If the index manages to sustain above the 24,400 levels amid continued volatility, it may trigger a technical pullback. It is worth noting that since the COVID-19 lows, the index has not recorded more than five consecutive weeks of declines without experiencing a rebound. Thus, traders are advised to avoid aggressive short positions at this stage.Structurally, the market remains in a secular bull trend. Historically, intermediate corrections driven by global and domestic uncertainties have provided healthy buying opportunities. We recommend investors remain calm amidst the current tariff-induced volatility and use this corrective phase to gradually accumulate fundamentally strong stocks with robust earnings.Bank Nifty traded within a narrow range with a corrective bias last week, as investor sentiment remained cautious amid ongoing tariff tensions between India and the U.S.The index is currently positioned at a crucial support zone between 55,200 and 54,900. This area coincides with the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) and key Fibonacci retracement levels from the previous uptrend, marking it as a significant demand zone.On the upside, resistance is expected in the 56,300–56,500 range, which aligns with the lower boundary of the recent breakdown area. A sustained move above this zone could signal a potential pause in the prevailing downtrend or an early sign of waning bearish momentum. Overall, the index is expected to trade within a defined range of 54,900 to 56,400 in the near term, with a clear directional move likely only after a decisive breakout from this range.The stock has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern over the past six months, typically continuation formation within broader trend cycles. The coiling of price within this triangular structure suggests a state of equilibrium between demand and supply forces, and we anticipate an imminent breakout on the upside as the apex of the triangle is approached.The projected price target from this anticipated breakout stands at ₹598, which is derived from the: (a) Measuring implications of the triangle's widest point added to the breakout zone. (b) 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the preceding corrective leg from the swing high of ₹804 down to the recent swing low of ₹419, thereby lending additional credence to this resistance target.The stock after the last 2 months corrective decline is witnessing buying demand from the 200 days EMA thus offers fresh entry opportunity with a favorable risk-reward set up.We expect the stock to head higher towards 4870 levels in the coming months being the 61.8% retracement of the last 2 months decline (5165-4401).The daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus supporting the positive bias in the stock.","Bajaj Broking Research says JSW Energy, and Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) are the top stock picks for today.

'CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED': Chipmaker's shares plunge over 3% after Donald Trump calls for Lip-Bu Tan's resignation; alleges ties to China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ceo-of-intel-is-highly-conflicted-chipmakers-shares-plunge-over-3-after-donald-trump-calls-for-lip-bu-tans-resignation-alleges-ties-to-china/articleshow/123170719.cms,"

Shares of Intel tumbled down on Thursday after US President Donald Trump called for the company’s chief executive to resign, citing alleged conflicts of interest involving ties to China.The INTC was trading at $19.77, down 0.6 points or 3.1% at 10:53 PM IST.“The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.“There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!” he further added.Trump’s remarks came shortly after senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel chairman Frank Yeary, raising concerns over CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s business connections.The letter questioned whether Tan had divested his interests in various semiconductor firms that reportedly have links to the Chinese Communist Party and China’s military.“In March 2025, Intel appointed Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO,” Cotton wrote in the letter.“Mr Tan reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms. At least eight of these companies reportedly have ties to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.”The senator specifically highlighted Tan’s recent leadership at Cadence Design Systems, a tech company that had earlier admitted to selling products to China’s National University of Defense Technology in violation of US export rules.“US companies who receive government grants should be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and adhere to strict security regulations,” Cotton posted on X.Intel is among the major beneficiaries of President Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act, having secured over $8 billion in federal funding to support the construction of chip plants across the United States.The company has yet to issue a response to either Trump’s post or Cotton’s letter.Following the controversy, Intel’s stock fell by 3%, even as broader markets, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq, moved higher.Founded in 1968 during the early days of the personal computing era, Intel has struggled in recent years. It failed to keep pace with the mobile revolution sparked by Apple’s iPhone in 2007 and has since fallen behind more agile competitors. The rise of artificial intelligence has only widened that gap, with Nvidia emerging as a dominant force in the chipmaking industry.Now under Tan’s leadership since March, Intel is undergoing major restructuring. The company is cutting thousands of jobs, slashing expenses, and even scaling back some domestic semiconductor manufacturing, all in an effort to turn around its declining fortunes.","US President Donald Trump called for the company’s chief executive to resign, citing alleged conflicts of interest involving ties to China.

Analysts said there was significant disappointment on revenue growth. The company added 27% stores between Q1 of FY25 and Q1 of FY26.

However, revenue growth (standalone) disappointed at 20% for Q1FY26.Antique has maintained its buy rating on Bharti Airtel with the target price raised to Rs 2,222 from Rs 2,100 earlier. Analysts said Q1 results were in-line with expectations, while FY26 subscriber growth estimates were cut by 1%, and ARPU (average revenue per user) remains unchanged.

Analysts also expect lower wireless capex to improve free cash flow and Return on Equity.Jefferies maintained its underperform rating on Bharat Forge with the target price at Rs 950. Analysts said that the Q1 was a tough one for the company and its export outlook is weakening and a weak macro and the rising US-India tariff rates have significantly impacted export outlook.

The United States has reaffirmed its view of India as a “strategic partner” while acknowledging ongoing tensions over trade and energy policy, with the State Department stressing the importance of “full and frank dialogue” to address differences.Responding to questions about the state of US–India relations at a press briefing on Thursday, principal deputy spokesperson for the US Department of State Tommy Pigott said, “India is a strategic partner with whom we engage in a full and frank dialogue. That will continue.”Also read: MEA official calls Donald Trump’s tariff hike a ‘unilateral decision’; says both sides were ‘very close to a solution’ He added that President Donald Trump had been “very clear” in outlining his concerns over issues such as the trade imbalance and India’s continued purchase of Russian oil.“Addressing those concerns through his actions, he’s spoken about them, whether it’s about the purchase of Russian oil or about the trade imbalance. Addressing those concerns is important. Ultimately, this is about a frank and full dialogue. That’s what it means to advance American interests, that’s what it means to have full diplomatic dialogue with partners to address concerns that we need to see addressed,” Pigott said.His comments came amid a fresh flare-up in the tariff dispute between the two countries. Earlier in the day, President Trump announced there would be no trade negotiations with India until the dispute was resolved. “No, not until we get it resolved,” he told ANI in the Oval Office when asked if talks might resume following his administration’s decision to double tariffs on Indian imports.Also read: Trump’s 50% tariffs on India leave exporters troubled An executive order issued on Wednesday imposed an additional 25 percentage points on Indian goods, raising the total levy to 50 per cent. The White House cited national security and foreign policy concerns, pointing to India’s imports of Russian oil, which it claimed posed an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to the United States.Asked if Washington was concerned that worsening ties could push India closer to China, Pigott repeated that the US approach was to address disagreements directly. “This is about an honest, full and frank dialogue about real concerns that this administration has, that the President has outlined very clearly,” he said.The diplomatic exchanges coincided with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Thursday, during which the two leaders pledged to deepen their strategic partnership in trade, energy, technology, defence, health and other sectors. The conversation came a day after Brazil, like India, was targeted by new US tariffs over Russian oil imports.Ministry of external affairs has called the US move “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable” and vowed to take “all actions necessary to protect its national interests.”","U.S. reaffirms view of India as a ""strategic partner"" while acknowledging ongoing tensions over trade and energy policy.

A sia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani has once again chosen to draw no salary from Reliance Industries, the oil-to-telecom-to-retail giant he heads, for the fifth consecutive year. Instead, dividend payouts remain his primary source of income, according to a PTI report.According to the latest annual report of Reliance Industries, Ambani, 68, received 'nil' salary, allowances, perquisites, and retiral benefits for the financial year 2024-25 (FY25).Ambani had capped his annual remuneration at Rs 15 crore between from financial year 2009 to 2020.Since FY21, he voluntarily opted to forego his salary due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has continued to do so each year since.Despite not drawing a salary, Ambani, who is currently the 18th richest person in the world with a net worth just under $100 billion, earned Rs 8.85 crore in dividend income from the 1.61 crore shares he directly holds in Reliance. This is based on the Rs 5.50 per share dividend declared by the company for FY25, as reported by PTI.In addition, promoter group firms under Ambani’s control hold 664.5 crore shares, amounting to a 50.07% stake in the company bringing in a combined dividend income of Rs 3,655 crore.The annual report also shed light on the remuneration of other top executives and family members.

US president Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he will nominate top economic adviser Stephen Miran to temporarily fill a vacancy on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.Miran, who currently chairs the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, is set to replace outgoing governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee stepping down on Friday. If confirmed by the senate, Miran will serve through January 31, 2026, reports AP.“It is my Great Honor to announce that I have chosen Dr. Stephen Miran, current Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, to serve in the just vacated seat on the Federal Reserve Board until January 31, 2026. In the meantime, we will continue to search for a permanent replacement. Stephen has a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University, and served with distinction in my First Administration. He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled — He will do an outstanding job. Congratulations Stephen!” Trump said through a post on Truth Social.The nomination of Stephen Miran could raise fresh concerns about political pressure on the Federal Reserve, an institution long valued for its independence from day-to-day politics. That independence is considered essential for making tough decisions, such as raising interest rates to control inflation, reports AP.As a Fed governor, Miran would have a vote on all interest-rate decisions and regulatory policies, and his appointment is expected to tilt the balance in favor of lowering interest rates. This is in contrast with the outgoing governor, Adriana Kugler, who aligned with Jerome Powell to advocate for holding rates steady while assessing the economic impact of tariffs.Trump has previously called on Federal Reserve policymakers, including Chair Jerome Powell, the six other Board members, and the 12 regional Fed bank presidents, to lower interest rates, reports Reuters.The Federal Reserve held its benchmark interest rate steady at 4.3 percent in a recent meeting, maintaining the level set after three rate cuts late last year. However, two Fed governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both appointed during Trump’s first term, dissented from the decision.""I look forward to quickly considering his nomination in the Senate Banking Committee and hearing more about his plans to increase transparency and accountability at the Federal Reserve to ensure the agency prioritizes its mandate and avoids politics,"" said Tim Scott, the Senate Banking Committee chairman.The Senate is not scheduled to return until September 2, at which time lawmakers will also face the urgent task of passing a government funding bill to avoid a partial shutdown at the end of the month, reports Reuters.Trump is also reportedly considering potential candidates to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term concludes on May 15, 2026.“Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell, a stubborn MORON, must substantially lower interest rates, NOW. IF HE CONTINUES TO REFUSE, THE BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL, AND DO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HAS TO BE DONE!” Trump said through a post on Truth Social last week.","US president Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he will nominate top economic adviser Stephen Miran to temporarily fill a vacancy on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.

Monetary policy: Bank of England trims rate to 4%; signals cautious easing ahead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/monetary-policy-bank-of-england-trims-rate-to-4-signals-cautious-easing-ahead/articleshow/123172248.cms,"Bank of England (Picture credit: AP)

The Bank of England on Thursday trimmed its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4 per cent, marking the fifth reduction since August 2024, as it seeks to support Britain’s slowing economy amid concerns over rising US tariffs and domestic tax hikes.The latest cut brings borrowing costs to their lowest level since March 2023, with Governor Andrew Bailey cautioning, “Interest rates are still on a downward path, but any future rate cuts will need to be made gradually and carefully.” The move came despite inflation rising to an 18-month high of 3.6 per cent in June, well above the BoE’s 2 per cent target, driven by persistent fuel and food prices.As per news agency AFP, the BoE now expects inflation to peak at 4 per cent next month, before easing back to target by the second quarter of 2027. The central bank also raised its growth forecast slightly, expecting the UK economy to expand by 1.25 per cent this year, up from the earlier 1 per cent estimate.While the direct impact of US tariffs is “milder than feared,” the central bank noted that broader uncertainty linked to tariff policies continues to dampen business sentiment.In May, the UK and the US agreed to lower tariffs, previously set above 10 per cent, on select British exports, including cars.However, baseline tariffs of 10 per cent on most UK goods introduced by US President Donald Trump in April remain in place.The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee faced an unprecedented situation during its deliberations. Initially split in a three-way vote, four members backed the cut, four favoured no change, and one called for a deeper 0.5 per cent cut, the decision passed only after a second round of voting, a first since the bank gained independence in 1997.The UK economy contracted for a second consecutive month in May, and unemployment has climbed to 4.7 per cent, its highest since 2021.As per AFP, analysts, including those at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, believe the Labour government’s decision to raise business taxes in April has also weighed heavily on business activity.“There are slightly more risks on the downside to activity,” said Bailey after the rate cut, as per AFP. “Economic growth is subdued, the labour market continues to loosen and consumption growth may take longer to pick up.”Treasury chief Rachel Reeves welcomed the BoE’s move, saying it would help reduce costs for “mortgages and loans for families and businesses.” She added that the government remained focused on boosting long-term growth through infrastructure investment and trade partnerships.Expectations that rates will remain steady at 4 per cent for longer have lent support to the pound, even as some traders remain cautious ahead of the Autumn Budget.","The Bank of England on Thursday trimmed its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4 per cent.

Foreign investors returned to Asian equities in July for the third month in a row, with Taiwan attracting its biggest inflow in nearly two decades and Thailand breaking a nine-month streak of outflows. The upbeat momentum was fuelled by growing interest in artificial intelligence, improved trade ties with the United States, and easing tariff concerns.Investment flows into most Asian markets have stabilised over the past three months as governments across the region secured more favourable trade deals with Washington, reducing volatility and uncertainty that had rattled financial markets.Taiwan and South Korea emerged as top picks for overseas investors in July. According to LSEG data, Taiwan drew $7.78 billion in foreign funds, the highest monthly inflow since the 2008 global financial crisis, while South Korea saw $4.52 billion, its strongest since February 2024.The MSCI index tracking Asian equities excluding Japan rose 2% last month, marking its fifth straight month of gains. Stock benchmarks in Taipei and Seoul both climbed around 6%.Over the past three months, Taiwan and South Korea, both major tech exporters, have collectively attracted $25.7 billion, riding a wave of global investments into AI-related industries, Reuters reported.In South Korea, investor confidence was further supported by shareholder-friendly reforms, political stability, and strong corporate performance. However, fresh concerns around potential tax policy changes are beginning to raise caution among market participants.Thailand, meanwhile, saw foreign investors return after a prolonged exit, with net inflows of $499 million in July, the first since September last year. Bargain-hunting helped drive demand after months of heavy selling.Even so, the Thai market continues to face headwinds. Political uncertainty, weak macroeconomic indicators, and a strong currency that weighs on export competitiveness are dampening investor appetite for the longer term.Thailand's benchmark SET index surged 14% in July, its best performance since November 2020. But the rebound wasn't enough to offset earlier losses — the index is still down 10% this year, making it one of the region's worst performers.""We are cautious and underweight on Thailand as it remains in a fairly precarious position: high household debt, limited government spending, an uncertain political environment, and external negative events such as the conflict with Cambodia,"" said Kenneth Tang, senior portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management.""If Thailand can settle these issues, it will clear up the path for its recovery,"" Reuters cited Tang.Elsewhere in Asia, India witnessed sharp foreign outflows of over $2 billion in July, its largest monthly sell-off since February, ending a three-month streak of net buying. Indonesia and the Philippines also saw outflows of $570 million and $29 million, respectively.Vietnam, on the other hand, attracted $326 million in foreign funds in July, with investors encouraged by the country's strong growth outlook and a favourable tariff arrangement recently secured with the United States.","Taiwan drew $7.78 billion in foreign funds, the highest monthly inflow since the 2008 global financial crisis.

Low-income Americans are pulling back on spending, often saying no to eating out, traveling, and even cutting back on basics like diapers, fizzy drinks, and beer, as import duties continue to push prices higher.In response, many fast-food chains are now offering cheaper, smaller meal bundles to keep demand steady.Researchers at Yale’s Budget Lab and the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity say the brunt of these price increases is likely to fall on the poorest Americans, as importers pass on the costs to consumers.According to recent earnings reports and executive commentary cited by Reuters, consumers are increasingly turning to bargains.Industry experts have warned that companies may need to cut into profits, as relying on price hikes to boost revenue is becoming unsustainable.Executives from Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, and Chipotle Mexican Grill say consumers are becoming more bargain-conscious as inflation persists and recent tariff hikes under US President Donald Trump begin to affect everyday goods.“It does feel like there are certain cohorts of the consumer, definitely on the lower-income side, that are feeling pressure right now,” Chipotle’s Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer told Reuters.Procter & Gamble noted that Trump’s tariffs have already raised the cost of some of its products.Definitions of “low income” vary by location and family size. Bank of America, the country’s second-largest consumer-facing bank, classifies those earning $50,000 or less as “lower income” and more likely to live paycheck to paycheck.Chipotle uses a slightly higher threshold of $75,000, while Coca-Cola considers households earning under $40,000 as low-income.Chipotle said it would keep the financial strain on its lower-income customers in mind when considering future price increases.Seen as a bellwether for consumer products, P&G offered a cautious outlook for its fiscal year, citing multiple pressures on consumer spending: Trump’s tariffs, immigration crackdowns, high interest rates, and sustained inflation.Coca-Cola is responding by promoting more affordable options for budget-conscious shoppers, according to CEO James Quincey.Molson Coors also reported a shift in consumer behavior, with more buyers seeking smaller, cheaper pack sizes.With the cost of essentials like Hershey’s chocolate and Tide detergent rising, and cuts to federal food aid programs looming, many households are feeling the squeeze. Pandemic-era savings have largely been depleted.“Re-engaging the low-income consumer is critical, as they typically visit our restaurants more frequently than middle- and high-income consumers,” said McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski.He noted a double-digit decline in fast-food visits from lower-income earners compared to last year, adding that weaker jobs growth in July has made them even more cautious.Analysts are observing the same caution during major seasonal shopping events, including back-to-school sales. Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group pointed to diminished enthusiasm among budget-conscious households.Bank of America data shows that credit card spending by low-income consumers dropped in the three months to June compared to the previous year, even as spending among middle- and higher-income groups rose. While a strong labor market has provided some cushion, analysts and executives warn that pressure is mounting, Reuters reported.Fast-food chains are now scrambling to offer better deals. While $5 bundles are being promoted, households are still hunting for deeper discounts. McDonald’s said its reintroduced $2.99 snack wrap has shown “encouraging” results.Taco Bell’s $1 to $3 menu items — including sodas and burritos, have helped sustain demand. However, Yum Brands, which owns Pizza Hut and KFC, reported weaker sales for their higher-priced pizzas and chicken buckets.Kraft Heinz has said it does not expect consumer sentiment to improve this year and is rolling out larger, value-focused pack sizes to ease pressure on shoppers.“We also have a consumer who, unlike a few years ago when inflation was peaking, doesn’t have savings built up in the same way they did in 2022 and 2023,” said Katherine Cullen, Vice President of Industry and Consumer Insights at the National Retail Federation (NRF).“We see that particularly among lower-income consumers.”As the economic fallout from the tariffs continues, it’s clear that US consumers — particularly the most vulnerable — are being forced to make difficult choices about where and how they spend.","Low-income Americans are pulling back on spending, often saying no to eating out, traveling, and even cutting back on basics like diapers, fizzy drinks, and beer.

New data for jobless benefits shows that the number of American citizens filing for unemployment benefits rose modestly last week, showing that employers are still retaining workers despite looming uncertainty on the US trade policy.The number of Americans filing for jobless support rose by 7,000 last week to 226,000, according to figures released by the US department of labor on Thursday. That’s slightly higher than the 219,000 new applications economists had expected for the week ending 2 August.The report marks the first official government snapshot of the job market since last Friday’s bleak July jobs report triggered a sharp sell-off on Wall Street, and a stunning political reaction. Donald Trump, furious over the weak numbers, ordered the firing of Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which compiles the monthly jobs data.Weekly jobless claims are widely viewed as a gauge of layoffs across the country. Despite the uptick, claims have largely remained within the historically low range of 200,000 to 250,000 since the COVID-19 crisis slammed the economy in early 2020.This is only the second increase in jobless applications over the past eight weeks.Still, recent trends point to a cooling labour market.Last week’s monthly jobs report showed US employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, well below the 115,000 forecast. To make matters worse, revised estimates slashed 258,000 jobs from the May and June totals, and the unemployment rate edged up to 4.2% from 4.1%.Many economists believe President Trump’s unpredictable tariff measures, rolled out in April, have unsettled employers and made them hesitant to hire. The latest tariffs, steep taxes on imported goods, took effect on Thursday.While some trade deals have been reached and a few deadlines extended, uncertainty remains high. Economists warn the tariffs could drag on the economy and fuel another round of inflation.Major corporations have been trimming staff this year. Procter & Gamble, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, Microsoft, Google and Facebook parent Meta have all announced layoffs. Most recently, both Intel and The Walt Disney Co confirmed job cuts.Thursday’s data also showed the four-week moving average of jobless claims dipped slightly by 500 to 220,750, offering a more stable view of the underlying trend.Meanwhile, the number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week ending 26 July jumped by 38,000 to 1.97 million, the highest figure since November 2021.","The number of Americans filing for jobless support rose by 7,000 last week to 226,000.

South Korea narrowly avoided steep US tariffs on Thursday after sealing a high-stakes trade deal with Washington, capping new import duties at 15 per cent, instead of the 25 per cent originally set to take effect from Friday.As reported by The Korea Herald, in exchange, Seoul pledged a USD 350 billion investment package along with USD 100 bn energy imports from US and most favoured nation status to US, in key sectors which helped in reinforcing cap on tariffs.The agreement, reached just hours before the deadline, suspends the near-zero tariff regime under the 2012 Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and introduces a new ""reciprocal"" rate similar to deals recently struck with Japan and the European Union. The deal comes at a critical time, with the U.S. taking in nearly a fifth of Korea's total exports reports Korea Herald.The newly installed government in Seoul moved quickly to craft a deal acceptable to Washington, negotiating up from an initial USD 100 billion offer before agreeing to the final USD 350 billion package, below Japan's USD 550 billion commitment to the US.President Lee Jae Myung called the outcome a ""major breakthrough,"" crediting it with restoring predictability for Korean exporters.""This agreement aligns America's goal of manufacturing revival with Korea's ambition to expand its industrial competitiveness in the US market,"" Lee said in a Facebook post. ""It will further deepen Korea-US industrial cooperation and strengthen our alliance.""Of the Korean investment, USD 150 billion will fund a major shipbuilding initiative named ""Make American Shipbuilding Great Again.""

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a steep 100% tariff on imported computer chips and semiconductors, a move that could lead to higher prices for electronics, cars, appliances, and other tech-driven products.Speaking at the Oval Office alongside Apple CEO Tim Cook, Trump said, ""We'll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors.""""But if you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge,"" he added.This marks a major policy shift just three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from harsh tariffs.In April, devices like smartphones, computers, and other gadgets were excluded from additional tariffs, though some existing duties still applied.US Customs had recently updated guidance to exclude certain tech items from the 125% tariff on Chinese goods and a base 10% global tariff.Trump’s move aims to encourage chip manufacturing within the US Companies like Apple, Nvidia, and Intel, which have made large investments in domestic production — may benefit from the exemption.Big Tech has pledged around $1.5 trillion in US investments since Trump returned to office in January.Apple on Wednesday announced a new $100 billion investment to boost manufacturing in the United States.

Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor behind the success of Berkshire Hathaway, is widely admired not just for his wealth, but for his simple, time-tested investment philosophy rooted in discipline, patience, and self-awareness. One of his most powerful ideas is the “circle of competence” — the concept that you don’t need to understand everything about every business to be a great investor. Instead, staying within your intellectual comfort zone is the key to making rational, long-term decisions based on clarity and confidence rather than speculation or hype. As Buffett once wrote, understanding your limits is more important than having a vast amount of knowledge. This principle still offers a practical, enduring framework for anyone looking to invest wisely in today’s fast-paced, unpredictable market.Warren Buffett introduced the idea of a “circle of competence” in his 1996 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. He explained:“You don’t have to be an expert on every company… You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.”Simply put, a circle of competence is the area where your knowledge and expertise allow you to make sound decisions. Rather than spreading your investments thin across unfamiliar sectors, Buffett advises focusing on industries and companies you truly understand.Buffett’s approach is built on avoiding avoidable mistakes, rather than chasing maximum returns. The more familiar you are with a business model — how it earns money, its market demand, its competition — the less likely you are to be misled by market noise or hype. According to Pamela Sams, a financial advisor at Jackson Sams Wealth Strategies:“Buffett’s style keeps you focused on what the business does and why it matters. That’s how you avoid mistakes and busted portfolios.” This method protects investors from emotionally driven decisions and emphasizes clarity over complexity.Buffett invested in Coca-Cola when others doubted the move. His rationale wasn’t based on stock price speculation — he recognised the brand's global reach, strong pricing power, and customer loyalty. These traits made it a stable, long-term investment well within his circle of competence.Buffett has held onto See’s Candies for decades because of its reliable earnings, brand loyalty, and scalable business model. He understood the company deeply and valued its consistent performance over time.During the internet boom of the late 1990s, Buffett avoided tech stocks because they didn’t fit his knowledge base. That decision, ridiculed by some at the time, saved him and Berkshire Hathaway from the losses that followed the dot-com crash.Begin by identifying industries, products, or services you understand. This might stem from your profession, hobbies, or personal use. For example:When analysing a company:Buffett initially avoided tech companies, viewing them as unpredictable. But over time, he saw that Apple’s brand loyalty, ecosystem lock-in, and customer retention made it resemble a consumer staple, not just a tech firm. This shift illustrates that your circle of competence can expand — but only through genuine understanding, not overconfidence.Jumping into cryptocurrency, AI startups, or biotech firms just because they’re trending can be risky — especially if you don’t understand how those businesses make money or how to assess their sustainability.Using a product doesn’t always mean you understand the company behind it. For example, loving a new gadget doesn’t automatically mean the stock is a good investment. Competence involves analyzing financials, industry dynamics, and leadership.Buffett’s advice isn’t about staying stagnant. You can expand your circle by:For everyday investors, the takeaway is simple but profound:","Warren Buffett introduced the idea of a “circle of competence” in his 1996 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season.

India's manufacturing PMI shows steady growth in February,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-manufacturing-pmi-shows-steady-growth-in-february/articleshow/98327500.cms,"NEW DELHI: The growth momentum in India's manufacturing sector was maintained in February, with new orders and output increasing at similar rates to January, according to a monthly survey. The seasonally adjusted S&P Global India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at 55.3 in February, little-changed from 55.4 in January.The February PMI data pointed to an improvement in overall operating conditions for the 20th straight month. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion while a score below 50 indicates contraction.""India's manufacturing industry sustained robust growth of output and new orders halfway through the final fiscal quarter, albeit with a notable slowdown in the rate of international sales expansion,"" the survey released on Wednesday said.Companies signalled only mild pressure on their own operating capacities, with outstanding business increasing marginally in February and accordingly job numbers expanded only fractionally.As per the survey, 98 per cent of panellists reported no change in employment. Job creation failed to gain meaningful traction as firms reportedly had sufficient staff to cope with current requirements, said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.The domestic market was the main source of new business growth, as new orders from abroad increased only fractionally. The rise in international sales was the weakest in the current 11-month period of expansion.""... most of the upturn in new orders welcomed by firms was domestically driven as international sales rose at a marginal pace that was the weakest in almost a year,"" Lima said.On the prices front, input cost inflation accelerated to a four-month high, with firms mentioning higher prices for electronic components, energy, foodstuff, metals and textiles.""After slipping to a 26-month low last November, input cost inflation surged in every month since. The latest rise was historically subdued, however, and among the weakest in around two years.""The survey showed some reluctance among manufacturers to pass on cost increase to clients, with output charge inflation easing since January,"" Lima said.Meanwhile, business confidence improved in February, with firms expecting demand strength, new product releases and investments to bode well for growth prospects.The S&P Global India Manufacturing PMI is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers in a panel of around 400 manufacturers. The panel is stratified by detailed sector and company workforce size, based on contributions to GDP.","The February PMI data pointed to an improvement in overall operating conditions for the 20th straight month.

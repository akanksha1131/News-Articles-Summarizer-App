Vodafone Idea shares surge 18% after Union Cabinet approves bank guarantee waiver,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vodafone-idea-shares-surge-18-after-union-cabinet-approves-bank-guarantee-waiver/articleshow/115691990.cms,"The Cabinet offered relief to telecommunications firms by eliminating bank guarantee requirements for spectrum acquisitions through 2022.

Vodafone Idea share price today: Vodafone Idea (Vi) shares surged 18.08% to Rs 8.23 on the BSE during early Tuesday trading, following the Union Cabinet's in-principle approval regarding the company's bank guarantee matter. At 2:53 PM, shares of Vi were trading at Rs 7.59, up 8.74%.The Cabinet offered relief to telecommunications firms by eliminating bank guarantee requirements for spectrum acquisitions through 2022. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had supported this waiver for spectrum purchases.The reforms of 2021 had already removed bank guarantee requirements for auctions from 2022 onwards. Vi's total bank guarantee obligation stands at Rs 24,700 crore, with the spectrum auction dues moratorium concluding in October 2025.Vodafone Idea defaulted on its second bank guarantee (BG) payment of approximately Rs 350 crore on November 1, relating to spectrum acquired in the 2012 auction. Previously, the company had missed a BG payment exceeding Rs 4,600 crore for 2016 spectrum auction in September, as reported by ET.Although Vi spearheaded the BG waiver request, with support from other telecommunications firms, the government's decision particularly advantages Vi. Whilst competitors Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio also require BG submissions for previous auction payments, their obligations are considerably smaller than Vi's.Bharti Airtel faces a BG payment of roughly Rs 2,200 crore due in September next year for the 2016 auction. Jio's obligation of approximately Rs 4,400 crore follows afterwards.Vi requested the waiver citing financial constraints, anticipating that this would enable banks to extend additional credit facilities to the company.Following this development, Bharti Airtel shares increased by 1.6% to Rs 1,604.95, whilst Jio Financial Services shares declined nearly 1% to Rs 320.10 on the BSE.","Vodafone Idea (Vi) shares surged 18.08% to Rs 8.23 on the BSE during early Tuesday trading.

NEW DELHI: The revival of Air India, ""the Everest of corporate turnarounds"", is ""not a T20 match but a five-day one currently at lunch on day three"". That's how Air India MD & CEO Campbell Wilson on Thursday described the Tata Group 's mammoth task at hand with the Maharaja, weeks after merging erstwhile Vistara and AirAsia India into AI and AI Express, respectively.Amid continuing poor cabin product, flight delays and integration issues, the veteran from Singapore Airlines admitted, ""We have work to do but what we have achieved in just over two years has few parallels among airlines globally."" While passengers on costly but delayed intercontinental flights with broken seats have begun questioning the pace of change, reviving AI, which saw no investment in its last few years as a cash-strapped PSU, is an uphill task.Crippling global supply chain constraints are leading to longer than expected waits for inducting new planes. This has made the task of revamping old legacy fleet more difficult, despite Tatas spending billions of dollars on getting JRD's baby back into shape.Asked if AI had bitten off more than it could chew in its current state, Wilson said: ""The health of (AI's legacy planes, especially wide bodies) is not as good as we would like it to be. Coupled with weather and airspace issues, when even one factor causes a delay, it takes a while to catch up. There are (less than required) non-stops to North America but no wide body aircraft are available globally as of now. We had an opportunity to lease some of these planes (to add flights). There is a demand to travel. Had we not taken these planes and added flights, there would have been a long wait to do so. Yes, we wish (the wide body non-stops) were more smooth (on-time)."" AI has 51 weekly non-stops to North America.While that remains work in progress, AI has been more successful in some other tasks. The average age of cabin crew has now dropped to 28 from earlier 40s in AI's state-owned days. ""We have hired 9,000 people. The average employee age has dropped from 54 to 34. By 2027, we will have 100 more planes in our current combined fleet of 300,"" Wilson said.Most of the aircraft coming over the next few months will be narrow body and then wide body will be taken out of service for revamping. So, the growth will come mainly from domestic and nearby international sectors for about one-two years. When revamped old wide bodies and new ones join the fleet, this segment will grow.","Air India's revival is ""not a T20 match but a five-day one currently at lunch on day three"", says CEO.

We should let the new govt (in the US) come and take charge and express their formal and official views.

Having said that, I strongly raised this issue with my French counterpart and did express India's deep disappointment on the unilateral regulations and many new regulations that the European Union has come out with, which are not acceptable to anybody in the world, which have been opposed by developed countries as much as by developing and less developed countries"".Goyal also criticised the Opposition for disrupting Parliament and maligning country's image.Separately, BJP MP Vivek Thakur said that the ecosystem causing disruption is seeking to hold back India's development journey. ""It's crucial for the people to be aligned with the thought process that focuses on development, especially with efforts to mislead on India's development story. At the root of this is India's economic success story, and we need to delve deeper to understand any changes that have occurred.

MUMBAI: New-age companies headed for public markets next year may have to temper their valuation expectations and reassess the timing of their IPOs as geopolitical uncertainties and other external factors risk weighing on broader investor sentiment.Zepto, PhysicsWallah and OfBusiness are among startups eyeing a public debut in 2025. Besides, public issues of companies like Ather Energy - which has already filed draft IPO papers with Sebi - are also queued up.""Recent shifts such as choppy Indian markets and the benefits over China narrowing underscore valuation concerns. Donald Trump's election win has also introduced uncertainties with anticipated pro-growth policies in the US, prompting global asset allocators to evaluate emerging market investments cautiously,"" Neha Agarwal, MD & head of equity capital markets at JM Financial Institutional Securities, told TOI, adding that global headwinds could influence IPO timing and companies' strategies. There may be adjustments in the valuations of IPOs due to external factors, Abhinav Bharti, MD (head of equity capital markets) at JP Morgan India, said even as (overall) IPO activity is expected to persist on the back of strong domestic fundamentals.Startups had a good run in the IPO market this year with several big players like Ola Electric, FirstCry and Swiggy getting listed on the bourses. While choppy markets nudged Swiggy to temper its valuation to $11.3 billion from its initially targeted valuation of $13 billion, the company's Rs 11,327 crore IPO was the second-largest public issue to hit the market this year after Hyundai Motor India's Rs 27,870 crore IPO.

The success of Swiggy and FirstCry's IPOs has nudged more companies in the space to speed up their listing plans. ""Many companies are actively assessing their readiness for the public markets... there is also a growing trend of companies re-domiciling to India... this shift is particularly appealing to new-age companies that see value in being listed on Indian exchanges,"" Bharti added.Even as companies will have to gear up to navigate global headwinds, IPOs by new-age companies are largely expected to sail through, helped by the depth of the domestic market. In fact, IPOs from technology companies alongside firms operating in the consumer and financial services spaces are likely to dominate public listings next year, investment bankers said.""New-age companies will continue to be a strong force in the 2025 IPO landscape as public markets become an increasingly attractive option for them to raise funds and provide lucrative exits for early investors. As these companies grow larger, public markets offer them access to substantial growth capital that private markets may not be able to provide,"" Gaurav Sood, MD and head of equity capital markets at Avendus Capital, said. New-age companies are expected to make up about 15-20% of the $10-15 billion estimated to be raised through IPOs in the coming few months.Sudarshan Ramakrishnan, co-head of India investment banking at Goldman Sachs, expects India's overall equity issuance in 2025 to surpass that of 2024 as robust economic growth, the burgeoning middle class and digital transformation continue to attract domestic and global investors.","Zepto, PhysicsWallah and OfBusiness are among startups eyeing a public debut in 2025.

The Dargah Khwaja Saheb committee, a statutory body constituted by the minority affairs ministry, is the third respondent in the case.Advocate Yogesh Suroliya, one of Hindu Sena's three counsels, said the legal team submitted to the court a copy of former judicial officer and academician Har Bilas Sarda's 1911 book 'Ajmer: Historical and Descriptive', which purportedly mentions that remnants from a ""pre-existing"" Shiva temple at the site were used in building the dargah. ""We informed the court that there were continuous religious rituals at the temple till it was razed,"" fellow advocate Ram Swaroop Bishnoi said.Vijay Sharma, the third counsel, sought a survey by ASI of the premises to verify the petitioner's contention that the dome of the dargah contains ""pieces of the temple"" and that ""there is evidence of the presence of a sanctum sanctorum in the basement"".The lawsuit is similar to the Gyanvapi case , involving multiple Hindu plaintiffs who contend that the mosque in UP's Varanasi was built over the remains of a destroyed temple. ASI hasalready conducted a court-ordered survey there. The Krishna Janmabhoomi litigation in Mathura is another one, pertaining to a dispute over the ownership of the land where the Shahi Idgah now stands.In the Ajmer dargah case, Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta filed the petition in Sept but the initial hearing on the merit of the lawsuit was delayed because of a jurisdictional wrangle. The district and sessions judge then transferred the suit to the munsif court (west).The hearing was further delayed by the designated court asking for the petition in English to be translated into Hindi and submitted along with evidence and an affidavit.""The 38 pages of the lawsuit contain as many points of reference to show that aShiva temple pre-existed where the dargah is located,"" an advocate said. ""As in the Gyanvapi case, the Places of Worship Act, 1991, cannot be invoked to negate this suit.""Syed Sarwar Chishty, secretary of the Anjuman Moinia Fakhria, a body representing the dargah's hereditary caretakers, dismissed the Hindu side's arguments about the existence of a Shiva temple at the site of the Sufi shrine as baseless.

"Japanese banks sticking with Adani as Jefferies, Barclays review ties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japanese-banks-sticking-with-adani-as-jefferies-barclays-review-ties/articleshow/115788415.cms,"Stock Tumbles

Japan’s biggest banks plan to maintain ties to billionaire Gautam Adani despite US bribery charges, even as other global firms including Barclays Plc are reassessing their exposure to the Indian conglomerate.Mizuho Financial Group Inc. expects the latest saga surrounding Adani won’t have a long-lasting impact and intends to continue supporting the group, according to people familiar with the matter. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. also have no plans to pull back and will be open to fresh financing if needed later, people familiar with the matter said.Tokyo-based spokespeople for all three lenders declined to comment. An Adani Group representative didn’t comment immediately.The Japanese support underscores the divide among finance firms over Adani after he and others were charged with plotting a $250 million scheme to bribe India government officials to win solar energy contracts. Adani’s massive ports-to-power group has denied the charges and called the allegations baseless. Its representatives have been meeting with lenders and investors to reassure them and explain its stance on the matter.While it’s unlikely there’ll be new financing requests by the group for now, some global banks that are concerned about reputational risk are curbing their exposure to one of India’s biggest conglomerates. The capital-rich Japanese lenders take comfort that they’re backing cash-generative assets. Adani has strong government ties and any legal processes brought by the US will take a long time, according to the people familiar.“Drawing from their experiences in Southeast Asia in the ‘90s, Japanese banks have developed sophisticated frameworks for evaluating emerging-market risks,” Ben Charoenwong, an associate finance professor at Insead in Singapore, said about the lenders’ risk tolerance in the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis. “Banks like MUFG and SMBC, which view India as a crucial growth market, are unlikely to substantially reduce their overall India exposure” though they may tighten processes or raise risk premiums for certain deals.Meanwhile, Barclays, which has long been a go-to bank for Adani, has suspended extending new loans or financing to the group for now, according to people familiar with the matter.The British lender had been gradually decreasing its exposure in direct lending and bond underwriting since short seller Hindenburg Research took aim at the company last year, Bloomberg News earlier reported. Still, it provided part of a $394 million trade-finance facility last year to an Adani unit for a solar module plant. Earlier this year, Barclays was among bookrunners for a $409 million bond sale by Adani Green Energy Ltd.A Barclays spokesperson declined to comment on its exposure to Adani or the status of its relationship with the group.Jefferies Financial Group Inc., which stood by Adani after Hindenburg accused the conglomerate of fraud, hasn’t discussed new dealings with the group after further accusations surfaced following the US indictment, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank hasn’t made a formal decision on whether to pause or halt deals, and is awaiting a firm outcome from the charges before engaging in new business, the people said.Jefferies held some Adani shares temporarily on its balance sheet as a market maker, but not as an investment in the firm, the people said. The Adani Group represents less than 4 per cent of Jefferies’s India business, they added.The India arm of Jefferies last year brokered a $1.9 billion sale of shares in four Adani Group companies to GQG Partners, a Florida-based investment firm. More recently, Jefferies was a lead manager as the flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd. and other companies raised $500 million from stock sales last month.A representative for the New York-based firm declined to comment.Meanwhile, at least two other major US banks that were aiming to grab a small share of debt funding from the Adani group in recent months have now put those efforts on hold, according to people familiar.Japan’s biggest lenders, which recently raised their annual profit forecasts to fresh records, feature prominently in some of the biggest overseas bond deals this year by Indian companies, including Adani Group, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Most recently, they were among the arrangers of a planned $600 million bond sale by Adani Green that was canceled after the charges became public.Mizuho isn’t too concerned about the current investigation and has no intention of pulling back from the group, which hasn’t reneged on any payments, the people familiar said. Mizuho has helped finance Adani units running ports and airports, which are steady cash generators.Sumitomo and Mitsubishi UFJ are confident in the companies’ ability to repay borrowings and don’t expect the businesses to be affected much, the people said.Like their Japanese peers, some Middle East banks such as Emirates NBD Bank PJSC are equally unfazed about their relationship with Adani, the people said. They have no plans to pull back from existing commitments and will lend fresh money for future projects on the back of their regular diligence processes, the people said, adding that their capital was committed to good assets in the Adani portfolio. Emirates NBD declined to comment.“Japanese and Middle Eastern banks, with access to relatively low-cost capital, are actively exploring global growth and diversification opportunities,” said Ashutosh Mishra, head of research at the institutional desk of Ashika Stock Broking Ltd. “This creates a synergistic fit with asset-heavy Indian conglomerates like Adani, which offer a robust growth outlook.”Adani’s dollar bonds and stocks tumbled immediately following the indictment, indicating investors were spooked about rising risk. In the past week, S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Ratings and Fitch Ratings have all lowered their credit outlooks on some Adani companies to negative from stable. S&P cited funding access and financing-cost concerns. Fitch also said it may cut its rating on Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd.’s dollar bonds to junk.Companies in other sectors are also reassessing their ties to Adani. TotalEnergies SE said it won’t make any fresh investment in the group until the consequences of the US indictments have been clarified. Kenya meanwhile canceled two Adani contracts worth about $2.6 billion in the wake of the charges.Adani Enterprises’s shares tumbled 23 per cent on Nov. 21 following the US move, but have since recouped some of those losses. The stock rallied this week after the company said Gautam Adani and his aides have not been charged under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.",Mizuho Financial Group Inc. expects the latest saga surrounding Adani won’t have a long-lasting impact. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group also have no plans to pull back and will be open to fresh financing if needed later.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115788472,imgsize-23056,width-400,resizemode-4/115788472.jpg"

The GDP of the world's largest economy has exceeded 2% in eight out of the past nine quarters.The GDP data also revealed that a measure of the economy's fundamental strength which includes consumer spending and private investment and excludes variable components such as exports, inventories and government expenditure, increased at a robust 3.2% annual rate from July through September, improving from 2.7% in the April-June period.Consumer expenditure, representing approximately 70% of US economic activity, grew to a 3.5% annual rate in the last quarter, rising from 2.8% in April-June and marking the fastest increase since the fourth quarter of 2023. Exports also enhanced third-quarter growth, rising at a 7.5% rate, the highest in two years.However, both consumer spending and export growth were below the Commerce Department's initial projections.Business investment growth decelerated notably due to reduced investment in residential properties and commercial structures like offices and warehouses, although equipment expenditure increased significantly.The incoming President-elect will assume leadership of a generally stable economy when he takes office next month.The economic indicators show stability. The unemployment rate stands at 4.1%. Inflation, which reached its peak at 9.1% in June 2022, has decreased to 2.6%. While this exceeds the Federal Reserve's 2% objective, the central bank's satisfaction with inflation control led to interest rate reductions in September and this month.

It said signs of an economic recovery were emerging.In a note of caution, it said ""the critical next steps are to complete the commercial debt restructuring, finalize bilateral agreements with official creditors along the lines of the accord with the Official Creditor Committee and implement the terms of the other agreements.

A claim that Tesla founder Elon Musk once accused MacKenzie Scott , novelist, philanthropist, and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , of ""destroying Western civilization "" is currently resurfacing on social media. These rumors spread on various platforms, including Reddit, where one post claimed that Musk had criticized Scott for her philanthropy, which focuses on women, minorities, and marginalized groups.The claim, which cites a tweet from Musk, is true but requires context, according to a Snopes report.In March 2024, Musk posted a now-deleted tweet that read, ""Super rich ex-wives who hate their former spouse should be listed among 'Reasons that Western Civilization died.'"" Musk was responding to a post that criticized Scott’s philanthropic efforts, specifically noting that over half of her donations went to organizations focused on race and gender issues. The post asked, ""Who is Bezos' ex giving money to?""While Musk didn't directly name Scott, the context of his reply clearly pointed to the ex-wife of Bezos. The deleted tweet sparked significant backlash, and Musk later removed it. However, the tweet was preserved in the internet archive.This wasn't the first time Musk publicly criticized Scott’s charitable work. In May 2022, Musk expressed concerns about her donations, particularly to Democratic causes, according to a Snopes report. He suggested that Scott, in retaliation for her divorce from Bezos, was targeting all tech moguls, including him, by supporting political movements he believed opposed his business ventures, like Tesla.Scott is a prominent philanthropist. At the time of her 2019 divorce from Jeff Bezos, after 25 years of marriage, Scott, 50, received a 4% stake in Amazon. Forbes currently estimates her net worth at $30 billion, a decrease from $38 billion just days earlier and significantly lower than her peak of $59 billion in 2021.","Tesla founder Elon Musk once accused MacKenzie Scott of ""destroying Western civilization"" The claim, which cites a tweet from Musk, is true but requires context, according to a Snopes report.

This indicates a declining workforce demand, despite overall economic strength.The monthly average of weekly claims decreased by 3,750 to 217,750, smoothing out weekly fluctuations.Jobless benefit applications serve as an indicator of US redundancies.Following weakening employment figures and declining consumer prices, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points in September, followed by a 0.25-point reduction this month.Fed officials anticipated four benchmark rate reductions next year, following three cuts this year, as projected in September. However, this outlook has rapidly evolved.Recent robust economic indicators and President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies have prompted a more conservative approach from the Fed, potentially resulting in fewer reductions and higher rates than previously anticipated.The central bank has shifted its priority from inflation control to employment support, aiming to achieve a delicate balance of reducing inflation without triggering economic decline.September's 0.5-point rate reduction marked the Fed's first cut in four years, following increases since 2022 that elevated the federal funds rate to 5.3%, a 20-year high.Despite October's slight increase, inflation has consistently declined over two years, approaching the Fed's 2% goal, leading Chair Powell to confirm its general containment.In late October, government reports showed a Fed-monitored inflation measure reached its lowest point in three-and-a-half years.Early 2024 saw jobless benefit applications averaging 213,000 weekly before rising in May. July figures reached 250,000, suggesting high interest rates were affecting US employment.The US economy generated only 12,000 jobs in October, though economists noted the impact of strikes and hurricanes on temporary unemployment.The Labour Department's August report revealed 818,000 fewer jobs were created from April 2023 through March than initially reported, indicating a gradual employment slowdown and influencing the Fed's rate reduction decisions.","US unemployment benefit applications dropped by 6,000 to a near seven-month low to 213,000 last week.

This move could severely impact China's exports, particularly their profitability.Meanwhile, China's export sector, the cornerstone of its economy, is struggling with various challenges, including weak domestic consumption and a faltering housing market.Last year, China's exports to the US totaled $427.2 billion, despite the tariffs, compared to $147.8 billion in imports from America. In retaliation, China also imposed tariffs on US exports.Commenting on these measures, Zhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, described the initiative as promising.

But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

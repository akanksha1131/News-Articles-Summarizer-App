The day's trading concluded with Tesla's market value reduced by $150 billion, an amount that exceeds the total market capitalisation of Starbucks and several other major US-listed corporations!

What’s gone wrong between Musk & Trump?

Tesla share price crash: Where’s the stock headed?

The situation appears precarious now. Initially, Tesla's stock benefited substantially from Musk's association with Trump.

Currently, investor confidence appears shaken, resulting in substantial paper losses for Musk's personal Tesla shareholding, dropping $20 billion in a single day.

SpaceX in trouble?

Tesla share price crash: Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s escalating spat has wiped out a whopping $150 billion from Tesla’s market cap. Tesla's share price crashed over 14% as shareholders hastily sold their positions during an escalating verbal dispute between the US President Donald Trump and the Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is currently the wealthiest individual globally.Following Donald Trump's election, investors poured vast sums into Tesla shares, prioritising political considerations over financial performance.The consequences of this strategy became evident on Thursday when within three hours, the situation took a dramatic turn!The conflict originated from discussions about the president's budget legislation before intensifying rapidly. Following Musk's assertion regarding his role in Trump's electoral victory, Trump suggested potential governmental actions against Musk's enterprises, including Tesla and SpaceX.Trump expressed his views on Truth Social, stating: ""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!""Also Read | ‘Electric cars that nobody else wanted…’: Donald Trump’s shocking words on Elon Musk; says Biden should have terminated Musk’s subsidies Tesla share price crash on Thursday partly offset a significant increase that occurred during the eight-week period after Musk announced Tesla's plans to launch an autonomous, driverless ""robotaxi"" service in Austin, Texas, this month.The market participants are concerned that Trump's potential stance might slow down the advancement of autonomous vehicles in the United States, which could adversely affect Tesla.The company's current electric vehicle business faces challenges, making it crucial for them to swiftly transition into the era of driverless vehicles.""The whole goal of robotaxis is to have them in 20 or 25 cities next year,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a prominent Tesla supporter who now expresses concern. ""If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path,” Ives said according to an Associated Press report.He further stated, ""There is a fear that Trump is not going to play Mr. Nice Guy.""Following the November presidential election, investor enthusiasm drove Tesla's market value up by over $450 billion within weeks. Investors anticipated substantial gains from reduced regulatory oversight under Trump's administration and were optimistic about Musk's autonomous vehicle initiatives for American roads.The shares peaked on December 17, but subsequently declined when Musk's leadership of a government efficiency committee sparked boycotts and damaged Tesla's image. The stock has recently rebounded after Musk announced his renewed focus on Tesla and its forthcoming autonomous taxi service.The potential reduction in government contracts appears to majorly affect SpaceX rather than Tesla. SpaceX, a private space enterprise, has secured substantial NASA funding for International Space Station missions, including astronaut transport, cargo delivery, and various space operations. The company is currently developing a large-scale rocket for NASA's upcoming lunar mission scheduled for next year.Starlink, operating as a SpaceX division specialising in satellite internet services, has seemingly profited from Musk's previous cordial relationship with Trump.During his Middle Eastern visit with Trump last month, Musk revealed Saudi Arabia's approval for Starlink's aviation and maritime operations. Although the influence of political factors remains uncertain, recent agreements in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and other nations have emerged amid Trump's tariff warnings and diplomatic pressures.SpaceX's recent achievements are reflected in its valuation, which reached $350 billion through private financing and share sales, marking a significant increase from $210 billion in the previous year.","Investor confidence appears shaken, resulting in substantial paper losses for Musk's personal Tesla shareholding, dropping $20 billion in a single day.

According to Bajaj Broking Research, Idea Forge Technology, and Avantel are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for June 6, 2025:

Bank NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in the broad range of 56,000-53,500 in the last 6 weeks.

A key technical observation on the daily chart is that the index has already taken 6 weeks to retrace just 38.2% of the prior 2 weeks rally (49,157–56,098), indicating a shallow pullback that suggests underlying strength and potential higher bottom formation.

The Index is currently placed around the upper band of the last 6 weeks consolidation area 56,000-53,500. We believe closing above the 56,000 area will signal extension of the up move towards the 56,700 zone in the near term.

Failure to do so will signal extension of the last five weeks' consolidation. The short-term structure remains constructive with immediate support is placed at 55,000–55,200 levels, while key short-term support is seen at 54,000–53,500

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices extended their consolidation phase for the third consecutive week, reflecting a lack of directional conviction amid a backdrop of profit-taking at higher levels and macroeconomic event risk ahead of the RBI monetary policy outcome on Friday.The broader markets exhibited notable resilience, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Small cap 100 indices climbing 1.3% and 3% respectively, signaling renewed risk appetite and accumulation in high-beta pockets of the market.From a technical standpoint, the Nifty continues to oscillate within a well-defined 17-session consolidation band, demarcated by support at 24,400–24,500 and resistance near the 25,050–25,080 zone. The 24,400–24,500 region remains pivotal, being both the site of the prior breakout and recent swing lows. This area has repeatedly attracted buying interest, indicating strong demand absorption and a possible accumulation zone.A decisive breach below the 24,400–24,500 support cluster could act as a bearish trigger, potentially exposing the index to deeper corrective downside. Conversely, sustained trade above 25080 levels will open upside towards 25,300 levels in the coming weeks.With the RBI monetary policy decision scheduled for Friday, the outcome of the policy, particularly commentary on liquidity, inflation trajectory, and growth forecasts, will be closely scrutinized for directional cues.The stock has generated a breakout above last 3 weeks broader range of 585-501 signaling resumption of up move thus offers fresh entry opportunityThe daily 14 periods RSI has generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus validating positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 670 levels in the coming months being the measuring implication of the recent range breakout (585-501)The stock is currently trading above the short- and long-term moving averages signaling strength and overall positive bias.It has recently generated a breakout above the falling supply line joining the highs of August and December 2024 signaling resumption of up move.The daily ADX is in an up trend thus supports the positive bias in the stock. We expect the stock to head towards the all-time high placed around 200 levels in the coming months","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Idea Forge Technology, and Avantel are the top stock picks for today.

Gold and silver price prediction: Gold rates and silver rates have been volatile in the last few weeks, though recently there are signs of MCX Gold and MCX Silver rising. Precious metal prices are affected by worldwide geopolitical developments and market sentiment shifts following Donald Trump's tariff-related rulings. What’s the outlook for gold and silver prices and what should investors do?MCX Gold has recently surpassed its previous swing high of ₹97,700 (August 2025), signalling a bullish breakout from a falling channel pattern. This technical shift marks the end of a series of lower highs and lower lows, indicating a potential trend reversal. The immediate resistance is at ₹99,900, the all-time high, with crucial support at ₹97,650.This bullish momentum is supported by factors such as safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions and volatility in the US dollar index. Additionally, expectations of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve have further bolstered investor sentiment, contributing to gold's upward trajectory.In summary, MCX Gold's recent breakout above ₹97,700 suggests a shift towards a bullish trend, with the all-time high of ₹99,900 serving as the next target.Investors should monitor support at ₹97,650 for potential reversals.MCX Silver has recently surged to an intraday high of ₹101,500 per kilogram, extending its rally towards the ₹103,700 mark. This upward movement not only signifies a potential breakout above its previous all-time high of ₹100,444 but also sets the stage for a new record if the momentum persists. Should prices sustain above ₹103,700, the next immediate target is ₹105,000.The bullish trend is underpinned by a confluence of factors, including heightened safe-haven demand amid global economic uncertainties, a declining US dollar index, and expectations of a potential rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. Additionally, silver's industrial applications and investment appeal have contributed to its robust performance.Technically, the overall bias remains firmly positive, with support at ₹99,700. A failure to maintain above this level could lead to a retest of lower support zones. However, as long as prices hold above ₹99,700, the bullish outlook remains intact, with potential for further gains towards ₹105,000 and beyond.","Gold rates and silver rates have been volatile in the last few weeks.

Recommendations regarding the method of administrative allocation of satcom spectrum, as well as the charges, have been submitted by regulator Trai to govt, but no final decision has been taken on the matter.Starlink will also have to put the ground infrastructure within India to correspond with its satellites and enable communication services. ""This will take months to build, and will require approvals from security agencies,"" sources said. Starlink operates a constellation of Low-Earth Orbit satellites that are positioned around 550 km above the earth and closer than traditional geostationary satellites.","Starlink got approval for three licences - Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS), Commercial Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT), and Internet Service Provider (ISP) The company is expected to get trial spectrum over the coming weeks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121684271,imgsize-783660,width-400,resizemode-4/121684271.jpg"

RBI eases gold loan 'value' norms for small borrowers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-eases-gold-loan-value-norms-for-small-borrowers/articleshow/121684238.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI on Friday issued revised norms for loans backed by gold and silver, aimed at widening credit access for small borrowers and standardising regulations across banks and NBFCs. The new rules will come into force from April 1, 2026.Under the revised framework, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for smaller consumption loans has been increased. Borrowers can now avail loans up to Rs 2.5 lakh with an LTV of 85%, up from 75%. For loans above Rs 2.5 lakh and up to Rs 5 lakh, the LTV is capped at 80%, while loans exceeding Rs 5 lakh will continue to have a 75% ceiling. For bullet repayment loans, lenders must now calculate LTV based on the total amount repayable at maturity.The final rules are less restrictive than RBI's draft proposals in April. Earlier this month, the finance ministry suggested that the rules could be eased for small borrowers.To make access easier, lenders can accept a declaration or suitable document from the borrower as proof of ownership of the pledged gold or silver. This removes the earlier requirement for formal ownership records. However, repeated sanctioning of loans to the same borrower above lender-defined limits will be monitored under anti-money laundering provisions.The guidelines also ease underwriting norms for loans used for income-generating activities. Detailed credit assessment will be required only for loans above Rs 2.5 lakh. Loans below this threshold used for business, agriculture or purchase of productive assets will not need such scrutiny.For valuation, lenders must use the lower of the average closing price over the previous 30 days or the latest closing price, as published by recognised agencies. Only the intrinsic metal value will be considered; gems and other additions will be excluded. Lending against primary gold or silver - such as bullion or ETFs - is prohibited. Re-pledging of collateral or using it to obtain loans from other institutions is also disallowed. Consumer safeguards have been strengthened. Lenders must follow standardised assaying procedures in the borrower's presence and disclose their valuation method publicly. Auctions will need a minimum reserve price of 90% of the value.","RBI issues revised norms for loans backed by gold and silver.

"Repo rate cut offers hope for housing recovery, but bank transmission holds the key",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/repo-rate-cut-offers-hope-for-housing-recovery-but-bank-transmission-holds-the-key/articleshow/121682000.cms,"Anuj Puri, Chairman of ANAROCK Group, noted, “Lower repo rates make home loans cheaper, improving affordability for buyers. Affordable housing has seen its sales share fall sharply from 38% in 2019 to just 18% in 2024. A 19% decline in unsold stock, however, signals pent-up end-user demand that could now be unlocked—if banks pass on the benefits swiftly.”The decision is also expected to bring down developers’ borrowing costs, offering a boost to project viability and completion. However, Puri cautioned that global trade tensions and input cost inflation may offset some of the positive effects, especially in the luxury and commercial segments.Ashok Kapur, Chairman of Krishna Group and Krisumi Corporation, welcomed the rate cut, saying it would enhance buyer confidence and spur demand across housing categories. “Combined with earlier rate cuts, today’s move means borrowing costs have dropped by 100 basis points since last year. This will encourage more homebuyers to act,” he said.Avneesh Sood, Director, Eros Group, said the move is timely but stressed the importance of efficient rate transmission.“Affordable and mid-income housing, hit by a 28% fall in sales, will respond to this rate cut—but only if the benefits reach borrowers. The cut also improves project feasibility by lowering working capital costs, especially in Tier 2 and 3 cities. We risk losing momentum unless this opportunity is capitalized on quickly,” he added.Jaypee Infratech Executive Director Jash Panchamia highlighted that banks already offering home loans below 8% may further reduce rates, making real estate investment more attractive.While the repo rate cut is widely welcomed, its success now hinges on how effectively banks lower lending rates and how developers manage rising input costs amid global uncertainties.","Affordable housing has seen its sales share fall sharply from 38% in 2019 to just 18% in 2024.

What is Autopen?

What is Autopen and how does it work?



'Autopen is biggest political scandal in American history': Trump



Trump questions Biden's pardons



Here is a list of the former president's most controversial pardons:

Hunter Biden:

Biden pardons siblings:

Gen. Mark Milley, Dr Anthony Fauci:





The mechanical signature device known as the autopen, which received its first patent many years ago, has recently become a subject of political controversy due to US President Donald Trump 's assertions about Joe Biden 's alleged usage for signing pardons.Trump ordered an investigation Wednesday into whether former President Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents like pardons.In a memo signed Wednesday night, Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president's counsel to probe what he claimed was a ""conspiracy"" to ""abuse the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline.""An autopen is a mechanical device designed to recreate authentic signatures by physically manipulating a pen. Unlike stamps or digital signature prints, these machines can accommodate various writing instruments, from ballpoint pens to permanent markers, as listed in product specifications for commercially available autopens, Fox News reported.Contemporary autopen systems enable users to store signature patterns on portable devices like smart cards or USB drives for easy transfer to the machine.The signing process begins when a pen is inserted, and the signature is executed by pressing a button or using a foot pedal to activate the mechanism.In March, President Trump contested that if Biden employed an autopen for signing preemptive pardons for House select committee members who investigated the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, those pardons would be considered ""void"" and ""vacant.""Earlier, President Trump reiterated his concerns on Truth Social, stating ""With the exception of the RIGGED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2020, THE AUTOPEN IS THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY!!!""Interestingly, the device was also used to replicate a person’s signature and has been used by past presidents including Thomas Jefferson, John F Kennedy, and Barack Obama to sign ceremonial or routine documents when unavailable.The Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project, a conservative organisation, has also scrutinised this matter, suggesting that Biden's supposed autopen usage, considering his ""clear cognitive decline ... raises additional questions for investigators.""In his concluding weeks as president, Biden extended clemency and pardons to over 1,500 people, which his administration characterised as the most extensive single-day clemency action by any American president. Questioning Biden's mental acuity and decision-making authority, Trump asserted that he was unaware of the documents' contents when using the automated signing device. This raised concerns about his cognitive state during his presidency and his direct involvement in official decisions. administration.While Biden personally signed his son Hunter's pardon, the remaining pardons appear to have been executed using an autopen.In December 2024, former President Joe Biden issued a pardon to his son Hunter, contradicting his earlier promises to the American public. Hunter Biden had been convicted of three felony firearm offences during Special Counsel David Weiss' investigation, alongside federal tax charges for failing to pay over $1.4 million. Prior to his trial, Hunter entered an unexpected guilty plea.On January 19, 2025, just before leaving office, Biden granted clemency to his siblings James, Valerie, and Francis, along with their spouses. The pardons covered potential non-violent offences from January 1, 2014, through to the signing date. The House investigation revealed that Biden family members and associates had received over $27 million from foreign sources since 2014. Additionally, the family allegedly obtained more than $8 million in loans from Democratic supporters during Biden's vice presidency.On January 19, 2025, Biden also pardoned former General Mark Milley, Dr Anthony Fauci, and members of the January 6 House Select Committee. These pardons extended to committee staff and police officers who provided testimony. All pardons appeared to be signed using an autopen.","'Autopen is biggest political scandal in American history': Trump.

His outburst came as Wall Street rallied on stronger-than-expected jobs data, with investors weighing the Fed’s next move amid rising political pressure and persistent economic uncertainty.“Too Late” at the Fed is a disaster! Europe has had 10 rate cuts, we have had none,” Trump wrote, insisting the Fed should “go for a full point, Rocket Fuel!” and sharply criticizing the Biden administration’s reliance on short-term borrowing. “There is virtually no inflation (anymore), but if it should come back, RAISE ‘RATE’ TO COUNTER. Very Simple!!! He is costing our Country a fortune.”Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index jumped 1.2% in morning trading, heading for its second straight weekly gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 555 points, or 1.3%, to 42,874.34, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3%, lifted by a rebound in major technology names.The rally was broad-based, with all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 in positive territory.Investors appeared to shrug off concerns about economic headwinds, drawing optimism from Friday’s Labour Department data that showed employers added 139,000 jobs in May. While slower than April’s revised figure of 147,000, the pace of hiring suggested continued labour market resilience despite Trump’s trade policies and regulatory crackdowns.Trump’s volatile tariff regime and threats against trading partners have drawn sharp criticism from US businesses. Retailer Lululemon plunged nearly 20% after cutting its annual profit guidance, blaming rising costs linked to Trump’s import taxes. The fallout added to warnings from other sectors, including airlines and consumer goods firms, about margin pressure and potential demand slowdown.Still, Friday’s bounce in equities was helped by hopes that the Trump administration could ease tensions with key partners. A reported “very good” phone call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping raised optimism for progress in trade negotiations, although Chinese state media adopted a more cautious tone.Bond yields rose, reflecting shifting expectations for interest rate policy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury increased to 4.47% from 4.39% a day earlier, while the 2-year yield rose to 4.00%, up from 3.92%, indicating growing investor bets that the Fed could eventually pivot toward easing.Tesla shares recovered 3.6% following Thursday’s dramatic 14.5% plunge, triggered by Trump’s escalating feud with Elon Musk. The president had threatened to use executive powers to cut off federal contracts to Musk’s companies, wiping out nearly $150 billion in Tesla’s market value within a single session. The rebound came as both sides reportedly agreed to “cool off” amid backchannel talks arranged by White House aides.In global markets, European indexes posted modest gains while Asian equities were mixed. India’s Sensex rose 0.8% after the Reserve Bank of India cut its benchmark interest rate to 5.50%, marking a dovish shift as inflation eases.Oil prices remained stable, with US crude at $63.30 per barrel and Brent crude at $65.31. The dollar strengthened slightly against the yen, while the euro slipped to $1.1414, reflecting lingering caution in currency markets.As the Fed heads into its policy meeting later this month, markets remain on edge. Trump’s aggressive push for a large rate cut and his public criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell have reignited debate about central bank independence — and whether political pressure will influence the future trajectory of US interest rates.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 555 points, or 1.3%, to 42,874.34.

"Tariff tremors: US adds 139,000 jobs in May even as hiring slows and recession fears grow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tariff-tremors-us-adds-139000-jobs-in-may-even-as-hiring-slows-and-recession-fears-grow/articleshow/121676976.cms,"Amid rising concern over the economic fallout of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs and federal workforce cuts, US employers added 139,000 jobs in May — a slowdown from the previous month, but still a sign of resilience in a jittery economy.Hiring eased from a revised 147,000 in April, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%, the Labor Department said Friday. The monthly figure undershot expectations and added to the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s evolving trade stance and aggressive policy shifts, AP reported.Trump’s “massive taxes on imports — tariffs — are expected to raise costs for US companies that buy raw materials, equipment and components from overseas and force them to cut back hiring or even lay off workers,” the original AP report noted. At the same time, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has initiated sharp staff cuts and cancelled federal contracts, further clouding the hiring outlook.Still, much of the economic damage hasn’t yet fully emerged in government data. “Any signs of weakness in the data this week would stoke fears of a recession again,” said former Federal Reserve economist Claudia Sahm, now chief economist at New Century Advisors.“It’s too soon to see the full effects of tariffs, DOGE, or other policies on the labor market; softening now would suggest less resilience to those later effects, raising the odds of a recession. ”Employers have added an average of 144,000 jobs per month so far this year — well below the pace of 168,000 in 2024, 216,000 in 2023, and 380,000 in 2022. In 2021, as the economy rebounded from the COVID-19 shock, monthly job creation had peaked at 603,000.The broader data picture remains mixed. Job openings rose unexpectedly to 7.4 million in April, but layoffs ticked up and fewer workers quit their jobs — a sign of reduced confidence in the labour market. Meanwhile, the number of new unemployment claims hit an eight-month high last week, even as overall levels remain historically low.Trump’s tariff moves — and the erratic way he rolls them out, suspends them and reintroduces new ones — have already left a mark. The nation’s GDP shrank at a 0.2% annual rate in the first quarter. Imports surged as firms rushed to bring in goods ahead of duties, then plunged 16% in April once tariffs took effect. That sharp decline, said Roosevelt Institute economist Michael Madowitz, could depress jobs in warehousing and logistics.Despite the headwinds, the US economy and labour market have, until now, defied expectations. “Whether it’s the ISM surveys, the ADP figures, or the jobless claims, the tone is clearly one of a weakening economic momentum,” noted Barclays Private Bank strategist Julien Lafargue.","Hiring eased from a revised 147,000 in April, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%.

The S&P 500 also advanced, climbing 58 points to 5,997.59, up 0.98%, putting the benchmark index on the cusp of the key 6,000 level.At 9:40 am, Tesla Inc’s stock price rose sharply to $299.46, gaining $14.76 or 5.19% compared to the previous close.Markets were buoyed by improving investor sentiment, even as the US 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.472%, up 7.7 basis points, reflecting shifting expectations on inflation and interest rates. Despite the uptick in yields, equities remained resilient.Earlier, Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures gained 0.4% each, signalling a cautious optimism ahead of fresh labor market data from the US Labour Department later in the day.Job growth slowed in May, with employers adding a solid but reduced 139,000 jobs, down from a revised 147,000 in April. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, underscoring a resilient labour market despite headwinds. Economists caution that Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imports, aimed at reducing trade deficits but raising costs for US companies, could eventually slow hiring and potentially tip the economy toward recession.Trump’s unpredictable trade war and his crackdown on illegal immigration — which may limit the available workforce — have clouded the economic outlook. However, the effects of these policies have yet to fully register in the government’s economic data.Adding to market jitters this week was a public spat between Trump and Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. Tesla shares rebounded early Friday, climbing 4.7% after plunging 14.5% on Thursday following the heated exchange, which saw Trump threaten to use federal powers against Musk’s companies. The confrontation erased roughly $150 billion of Tesla’s market value in a single day, a loss larger than the market caps of many major US companies.Retail sector woes also surfaced as Lululemon shares plunged over 20% after the athletic apparel maker cut profit forecasts, citing tariff-related cost pressures and growing competition from start-ups. Consumer confidence appears to be wavering amid the ongoing tariff turmoil, weighing on discretionary spending.Investor hopes for a trade détente received a boost after Trump reported a “very good phone call” with China’s President Xi Jinping, with plans for their teams to meet soon. However, Chinese state media offered a more cautious assessment, tempering optimism.Global markets showed mixed reactions: Europe’s DAX and CAC 40 slipped modestly, while Asian indexes mostly advanced. India’s Sensex gained 0.8% following a key interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India to 5.50%.In the bond market, the yield on the US 10-year Treasury held steady near 4.39%, after falling earlier this week on speculation that the Federal Reserve may need to ease rates later this year to cushion the economic impact of tariffs.Energy prices showed little change, with US crude oil down slightly to $63.30 per barrel and Brent crude near $65.31.Currency markets reflected some risk-off sentiment: the US dollar strengthened against the yen, while the euro slipped to $1.1414.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) jumped 431 points to 42,750.83, a gain of 1.02%.

The US treasury department on Thursday stopped short of labeling China a currency manipulator, but criticised Beijing for its lack of transparency in exchange rate policies. The decision came in the treasury’s semi-annual report to Congress on the foreign exchange and macroeconomic practices of major trading partners.While the report did not officially accuse China of manipulating its currency, it noted that China stood out for not being open about how it manages the renminbi (RMB). A Treasury official told reporters that the US may still make a determination in the fall, depending on new evidence that could emerge.During Donald Trump ’s first term, then-treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin had labeled China a currency manipulator in 2019, the first time the US had done so since 1994.US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the administration “has put our trading partners on notice that macroeconomic policies that incentivize an unbalanced trading relationship with the United States will no longer be accepted.”He added that the treasury would use all available tools to counter unfair currency practices.The report comes as the Trump administration seeks to ease tensions with China and avoid a full-blown trade war. Trump said his first phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping since returning to office was “very positive.”He announced that trade negotiations would resume soon, though a meeting location is yet to be determined.Following the call, Trump agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on Chinese goods from 145- 30% per cent for 90 days to make room for talks. In response, China lowered its tariffs on US goods from 125- 10 per cent.The tariff adjustments have caused major swings in global markets and raised concerns about ongoing disruption to international trade, especially in critical sectors like rare earth minerals.","The US treasury department stopped short of labeling China a currency manipulator, but criticised Beijing for its lack of transparency in exchange rate policies.

Trump’s leverage: Political feud meets financial power

Regulatory chokehold: How else Trump could strike

‘We earned that’: Musk’s companies respond

Can Musk survive without Washington?

As political tensions flare, experts warn that Elon Musk’s empire, built on public funding, could face steep fallout. At the intersection of ambition and politics, Elon Musk’s multibillion-dollar space and electric vehicle empire may soon be at the mercy of President Donald Trump Despite being a vocal critic of government subsidies, Musk’s companies—SpaceX and Tesla—have long depended on them. And now, Trump’s public feud with the billionaire threatens to upend a financial relationship that has fuelled some of the most significant technological advances in America’s recent history.An in-depth investigation by The Washington Post revealed that Musk’s ventures have received at least $38 billion in government contracts, subsidies, loans and tax credits, much of it in just the past five years. That includes at least $6.3 billion pledged in 2024 alone. Tesla and SpaceX—two of the world’s most prominent tech companies—have not only thrived on this backing but, in many cases, owe their very survival to it.With Trump threatening to slash federal support over their growing differences, the question now being asked in Washington and Wall Street alike is: Could he actually destroy Musk’s business empire?Tesla’s journey from a cash-strapped start-up to the world’s leading EV manufacturer has been paved with government help.According to The Post, a $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy in 2010 allowed Tesla to engineer its flagship Model S and purchase a major California factory. The company repaid the loan by 2013, but not before it became central to Tesla’s survival and eventual IPO.In total, Tesla has earned $11.4 billion in regulatory credits from federal and state programs incentivising zero-emission vehicles—enough to offset years of operating losses. As The New York Times notes, those credits were instrumental in turning Tesla’s first annual profit in 2020. Without them, the company would have reported a loss of $718 million.Meanwhile, SpaceX has grown into the most vital contractor in America’s space program. NASA alone has invested nearly $15 billion in the company, which now operates the only crew and cargo transport to the International Space Station. The Pentagon and US intelligence agencies have also poured billions into SpaceX launches and secure satellite deployments.Under a $5 billion contract, SpaceX’s Dragon capsule remains the only American vehicle capable of crewed missions to the ISS. Musk’s threat—and Trump’s counter of potential contract terminations—now raises alarms about how political retaliation could upend US space programs.NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens told Reuters, “We will continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the president’s objectives in space are met.”As the relationship between Musk and Trump deteriorates, so do the prospects for continued public support. Trump has already proposed slashing key tax credits and subsidies, including the $7,500 consumer EV credit. According to analysts at JPMorgan, this could cost Tesla $1.2 billion in annual profit.Worse still, The New York Times reports that Trump has publicly threatened to cancel federal contracts to Musk’s companies. While that might seem unlikely given SpaceX’s dominant position, experts warn it’s not out of the question.As Ars Technica reports, such a move could set back the US space program by a decade. SpaceX is currently the only provider of crewed space flights for NASA and is contracted to safely de-orbit the International Space Station in 2030. It is also critical to America’s Moon mission via NASA’s Artemis program.While SpaceX’s market dominance may buffer it from complete collapse, analysts say the damage would still be immense.“It fortunately wouldn’t be catastrophic... but there’s no question that it would result in significant lost revenue and missed contract opportunities,” said Justus Parmar, CEO of SpaceX investor Fortuna Investments, reported Reuters.Former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver said pulling contracts would likely be illegal. But she warned Musk’s actions were dangerous: “A rogue CEO threatening to decommission spacecraft, putting astronauts’ lives at risk, is untenable.”Even without tearing up contracts, Trump could take a more insidious route: the regulatory bottleneck. As Ars Technica notes, agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) could slow or stall key Musk projects.The FAA could restrict Starship launch expansions, while NHTSA could ramp up scrutiny of Tesla’s Full Self Driving and Autopilot features—putting product development at risk.These tools are under Trump’s executive branch influence and could be weaponised without needing Congressional approval. “If the Trump government does in its feud with Musk is attack his financial interests,” said Paul Levinson, a professor at Fordham University, “Musk is very likely to not only survive but continue to thrive. But regulatory delays could reshape timelines and margins.”Despite the heavy reliance on public funding, Musk and his executives have defended their role in serving government interests. “We earned that,” SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said recently of federal contracts, pointing to the company’s track record in cutting costs and delivering results.Indeed, many in Washington see Musk’s ventures as having advanced key US goals—from decarbonising transport to dominating low-Earth orbit. “NASA is working with partners like SpaceX… for the benefit of all,” said NASA spokeswoman Cheryl Warner.Still, the contrast between Musk’s anti-subsidy rhetoric and the billions his companies receive hasn’t gone unnoticed. Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld told The Post, “With DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency], there does seem to be a paradox there. He has been a big beneficiary of national industrial policy.”In the short term, the answer is: possibly. Tesla has repaid loans and now generates billions in profit. SpaceX’s commercial Starlink service is booming. But long-term survival without government support is far less certain—particularly in the face of regulatory headwinds or a cancelled lunar contract.“Elon Musk is undeniably the architect of his empire,” said George Washington University’s John Helveston to NPR. “But government scaffolding helped build the skyscraper. If Trump starts pulling pieces out, the whole thing doesn’t collapse—but it shakes.”For now, Musk appears publicly defiant. But behind closed doors in Washington and Silicon Valley, the calculations are more cautious. The fate of America’s most iconic tech visionary may yet hinge on politics more than engineering.","Elon Musk’s multibillion-dollar space and electric vehicle empire may soon be at the mercy of President Donald Trump.

‘Electric cars that nobody else wanted…’: Donald Trump’s shocking words on Elon Musk; says Biden should have terminated Musk’s subsidies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/electric-cars-that-nobody-else-wanted-donald-trumps-shocking-words-on-elon-musk-says-biden-should-have-terminated-musks-subsidies/articleshow/121658376.cms,"AI-image

US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk , once allies, are now publicly feuding following disagreements over the government’s new tax bill. The rift, which has played out in a series of increasingly pointed online posts, appears to mark a significant break in their relationship.The spat intensified after Musk vocally criticised the bill, calling it “a disgusting abomination” and urging people to “kill the bill.” In response, Trump hit back on Thursday, expressing “disappointment in Elon” and claiming he had cut Musk out of key government decisions.""Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore. I was surprised,"" Trump said in remarks from the Oval Office.Soon after, the president took to Truth Social to assert that he had rescinded Musk’s influence over electric vehicle (EV) policies. “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!"" Trump wrote.He also suggested a potential move to cut off Musk's federal support: “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”Musk dismissed Trump's claims, responding with a curt rebuttal on X: “Such an obvious lie. So sad.” Taking a more light-hearted jab at Trump's threat to end federal contracts, Musk added, “This just gets better and better 🤣🤣 Go ahead, make my day …”In a separate post, Musk also asserted that Trump’s 2024 election win would not have been possible without his backing.“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” he claimed.Meanwhile, Trump continued to defend the bill saying, ""I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress. It’s a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn’t pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. I didn’t create this mess, I’m just here to FIX IT. This puts our Country on a Path of Greatness. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""The fallout is notable given their history. Musk once praised Trump for efforts to reduce bureaucratic red tape and briefly served on the president’s business advisory council in early 2017. However, he stepped down that same year over differences regarding climate policy.In recent months, the two had appeared to reconcile, with Trump lauding Musk’s intellect and Musk supporting Trump’s reinstatement on social media platforms. But their latest exchange suggests the alliance may have once again fractured.","US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk are now publicly feuding following disagreements over the government’s new tax bill.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country. CEA said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105332515,imgsize-39018,width-400,resizemode-4/105332515.jpg"
E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

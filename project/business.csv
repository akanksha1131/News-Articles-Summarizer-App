'Can Raise Tariffs Very Quickly': Trump Warns India Over Russian Oil Imports, Praises PM Modi

Oil prices dipped on Saturday after the United States launched a surprise military operation in Venezuela, capturing President Nicolas Maduro and his wife on drug trafficking charges, triggering sharp moves across global markets.Crude prices fell as investors bet that the political shift could eventually pave the way for higher oil output from Venezuela, which holds the world’s largest proven crude reserves. At the same time, heightened geopolitical tensions boosted demand for safe-haven assets such as gold and lifted defence sector stocks.US forces used a combination of special operations commandos, air strikes and naval assets to seize Maduro and his wife from Caracas. The leftist leader now faces narcotrafficking charges. Their President Donald Trump said Washington would “run” the South American country and allow American oil companies to return and tap its vast energy reserves. According to OPEC, Venezuela holds around 303 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, though production has remained depressed in recent years due to chronic underinvestment and infrastructure decay.Market participants, however, played down the immediate supply impact. “The market will likely absorb this short-term supply uncertainty, with a limited impact on oil prices,” said Helge Andre Martinsen, oil analyst at DNB Carnegie.the shock reverberated across other asset classes too. Defence stocks and precious metals gained; technology shares continued their upward momentum amid optimism over potential US interest rate cuts later this year.In currency markets, the US dollar traded mixed, while both gold and silver prices advanced as investors sought safe-haven assets amid elevated uncertainty.","US forces used a combination of special operations commandos, air strikes and naval assets to seize Maduro and his wife from Caracas.

Tax on interest from their own PF contributions beyond ₹2.5 lakh

Tax on NPS pension at retirement

Tax again if early withdrawal triggers PF conditions

Why reform is required

For a country that prides itself on a thriving middle class, India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality. Over the past few years, a series of amendments—presented as “rationalisations”—have quietly created a minefield for salaried employees who believed they were doing the right thing by saving for their future.Three provisions stand out for the burden they impose: taxation of employer contributions to provident and superannuation funds beyond ₹7.5 lakh; yearly taxation of accretions on such excess contributions; and taxation of interest earned on the employee’s own PF contributions above ₹2.5 lakh. In isolation each may appear technical. Together, they are reshaping retirement planning in ways that leave employees with little clarity, greater financial anxiety, and a rising tax bill on income they do not even receive today.The first shock for employees came with the Finance Act, 2020, which capped employer contributions to recognised PF, approved superannuation funds and NPS at ₹7.5 lakh per year. Anything above that—common for senior professionals, mid-level employees in high-cost cities, and those in organisations with generous retirement policies—became taxable as a perquisite.But what stings more is that annual accretion—interest, dividend or similar growth—on this “excess contribution” is also taxed. This is a tax on notional income, long before the employee sees a rupee of it.Many describe this as an upfront penalty on saving. Unlike bonuses or cash payments, retirement contributions are locked in for the long term. Yet tax is now collected today on money that may only be received decades later. That mismatch betweenandhas become a major pain point.When exemption isn’t really exemptionThe hardship intensifies when the National Pension System comes into play. While the government justified taxing excess employer contributions by calling PF, superannuation and NPS an “EEE regime”, the law doesn’t fully support that claim.Under Section 10(12A), up to 60% of the NPS corpus can be withdrawn tax-free upon closure of the account or opting out of NPS. The remaining 40% must be used to purchase an annuity plan from a life insurance company, and the pension received from this annuity is fully taxable. Employees therefore argue that the premise of an entirely exempt regime is not accurate.The Finance Act, 2021 introduced another hit: PF interest earned on the employee’s own contribution beyond ₹2.5 lakh per year is taxable.For many mid-career employees, PF is the only disciplined savings instrument they rely on. A high PF contribution isn’t a luxury; it is a way to secure the future in the absence of universal social security.Yet the law now characterises high contributions—even when mandatory or part of salary structure—as an attempt to “enjoy full exemption”. The sting is sharper for those whose basic salary is high enough that the statutory 12% PF contribution itself may cross the ₹2.5 lakh threshold, triggering tax on interest even when the employee never intended to “over-contribute”. This change is seen as especially harsh in a country where inflation erodes purchasing power and pension adequacy is already a concern.“Also, these changes all appear to be part of the ultimate aim of the government to do away with all deductions and exemptions and make the ‘new tax regime’ the only regime available for all taxpayers,” says Ameet Patel, partner, Manohar Chowdhry & Associates.Across these provisions, a consistent theme emerges:India now taxes retirement savings more aggressively. Employees who save diligently, especially mid- to senior-level workers, face:The result is that long-term savings face multiple tax points.There is growing consensus across industry bodies that these provisions need urgent review. The argument is not about giving employees a windfall—it is about ensuring fairness and a safety net. With an ageing population, lack of a universal social security system applicable to all citizens, and rising cost of living, the existing provisions are detrimental . India’s salaried class feels squeezed—not because they don’t want to pay taxes, but because the system increasingly treats retirement savings as a luxury rather than a necessity. What was once a predictable, trusted savings pathway is now layered with caps, tax triggers, and compliance complications.“And this compounds the problems that the ageing population faces when insurance companies either refuse to issue new health policies to senior citizens or charge such high premia on the policies that having a Mediclaim policy becomes extremely expensive for such retired persons. As and when such a person needs large amounts to be paid to hospitals for medical treatments, the depleted savings are often inadequate and the entire family is put under huge financial stress,” concludes Patel.","India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality. A high PF contribution isn’t a luxury; it is a way to secure the future in the absence of universal social security. Unlike bonuses or cash payments, retirement contributions are locked in for the long term.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126356780,imgsize-44462,width-400,resizemode-4/budget-2026.jpg"
Lower demand for electric cars dents GM's sales,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/lower-demand-for-electric-cars-dents-gms-sales/articleshow/126363725.cms,"Tariff effect?

General Motors reported a dip in fourth-quarter US auto sales Monday, reflecting a sharp decline in electric vehicle transactions amid a broader slowing car market.But the US auto giant also achieved an annual sales increase, pointing to growth in pickups and crossovers sales as evidence of resonance with consumers despite offering lower incentives than the industry average.The Detroit giant reported 703,000 deliveries in the final quarter of 2025, a drop from the year prior of 6.9 percent, in a period characterized by tepid consumer confidence surveys.Other carmakers to report a drop in US sales in the fourth quarter included Honda, Nissan and Volkswagen, while Toyota and Stellantis were higher.Analysts at Cox Automotive had estimated a 4.7 percent drop in overall US car sales in the fourth quarter, with concerns about a weakening job market, high interest rates and cost-of-living pressures weighing on sentiment.A driver of GM's decline was a pronounced fall in EV sales from the third quarter, when consumers raced to take advantage of a $7,500 tax credit that expired at the end of September, earlier than initially intended due to legislation championed by US President Donald Trump.EV sales at GM were 25,219 in the October to December period, less than half the level in the third quarter of 2025.GM's annual sales were 2.8 million, up 5.5 percent from 2024.Among the vehicles with sizable gains were the Chevrolet Equinox, a small ""crossover"" sport utility vehicle and the GMC Sierra line of pickup trucks.""Demand for our brands and products is strong at every price point, and we are well-positioned to build on this momentum in the year ahead,"" said GM senior vice president Duncan Aldred.At Toyota, fourth-quarter sales rose about eight percent to 652,195, in line with annual growth of comparable percentage. Total sales were 2.5 million for 2025.Toyota models with significant year-over-year sales increases included the Grand Highlander SUV and Tacoma pickup.Stellantis, meanwhile, scored a four percent increase in the fourth-quarter to 332,321, helping to reduce the size of its annual drop after a number of weak quarters.Stellantis annual sales fell three percent to 1.3 million.""With consecutive quarterly sales increases and market share growth, it's clear that we are taking the right steps to reset our business in the US,"" said Jeff Kommor, head of US retail sales, who pointed to five new vehicle launches scheduled for 2026.Throughout 2025, automakers were faced with a fast-changing policy environment as Trump announced myriad tariff actions and moved to gut climate measures enacted under predecessor Joe Biden.Tariff costs did not lead to significant hikes in retail prices in 2025, in part because dealers were selling autos from inventory.However, analysts say consumers may see greater car price hikes in 2026 due to tariffs, potentially affecting demand.Cox estimates that US sales will come in at 15.8 million in 2026, or 2.4 percent below its projection for 2025 sales.","GM reports 703,000 deliveries in the final quarter of 2025, a drop from the year prior of 6.9 percent.

From tinker tool to daily assistant: AI's quiet rise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/from-tinker-tool-to-daily-assistant-ais-quiet-rise/articleshow/126360704.cms,"BENGALURU: For much of 2025, artificial intelligence did not enter people's lives through dramatic product launches or viral demos. Instead, it slipped in quietly, taking over small, repetitive tasks that many users barely noticed. What began as casual experimentation with chatbots has, for many, evolved into a set of everyday tools that now handle remembering, planning, drafting and filtering information in the background.One of the most common uses of AI today is as a personal memory and life ledger. Hyderabad-based AI product manager Saumya Shikhar uses ChatGPT to log work achievements, skills he is building and challenges he encounters on the job. He also maintains separate chats to track RBI interest rate movements that affect his loan repayments, and another to record his health history. ""That way, I feel like I have personal assistants with infinite memory and quick wisdom all the time,"" he said.Others are embedding AI even more deeply into their daily recall. Vignesh Ramakrishnan, founder of a Bengaluru-based AI consulting firm, built a WhatsApp-based AI assistant that acts as his operational memory.The system logs voice notes, handwritten notes, calendar entries and client conversations, and can retrieve details weeks later on request. ""Earlier, client details were scattered across chats, notes and spreadsheets,"" he said. ""Now I just ask one place.""Another widespread shift is the use of AI to filter signal from noise. Instead of scanning crowded inboxes or unread newsletters, users increasingly rely on AI-powered curation tools. Dr Sneha Jain uses Readerwise and Pocket to curate and prioritise what she reads during the week.""I start each morning by scanning only high-signal insights instead of wading through inbox noise,"" she said, adding that saved articles now resurface during short breaks between meetings, turning idle minutes into focused reading time.Drafting and structuring work remains one of the most common daily uses of AI. Tools such as ChatGPT, Claude and Copilot are now routinely used to turn rough thoughts into first drafts of emails, notes and long-form documents.Newer tools like Gemini's Nano Banana and Gamma are increasingly being used to generate presentation visuals and slide decks from basic prompts. Meeting-focused tools such as Granola are also gaining traction for recording conversations and auto-generating summaries and action points. Founder and author Pavan Govindan said the biggest change has been the removal of thinking friction. ""AI hasn't replaced judgment or creativity,"" he said. ""It has replaced the blank-page problem.""","Artificial intelligence is taking over small, repetitive tasks that many users barely noticed.

Samsung Electronics on Monday pulled the wraps off what it described as the world's first and largest 130-inch Micro RGB TV, the R95H, at CES 2026, positioning the new screen as its biggest Micro RGB display yet and a new showcase for ""next-generation colour display and AI engine"" in the ultra-premium segment.Samsung said the 130-inch Micro RGB model features its most advanced Micro RGB innovations to date. The company said the AI processing is designed to enhance dull tones and refine contrast, aiming to deliver vivid color and subtle detail across bright and dark scenes for realism and picture fidelity.The display tech also promises better brightness and more saturated colors, with Samsung saying the R95H's use of Micro RGB LEDs means it's potentially able to display more colors.At Samsung's CES 2026 demo, the 130-inch panel was hard to miss. The company used RGB tech that allows the microscopic red, green, and blue diodes to generate color independently.Samsung said the R95H uses AI to lift shadow detail, refine contrast, and maintain accurate colors in both bright and dark scenes. The 130-inch model also includes Samsung's proprietary Glare Free technology, which the company said minimizes reflections while preserving clear color and contrast across a variety of lighting conditions.. With a huge frame and improved audio performance, the 130-inch display is intentionally designed to appear less like a television and more like a vast, immersive window that visually expands the room.The R95H supports HDR10+ Advanced and runs Tizen OS, which Samsung said promises seven years of updates.""Micro RGB represents the peak of our picture quality innovation, and the new 130-inch model takes that vision even further,"" said Hun Lee, Executive Vice President of the Visual Display (VD) Business at Samsung Electronics.

"Samsung spotlights Galaxy Z TriFold at CES 2026, pitching a phone-tablet hybrid",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/samsung-spotlights-galaxy-z-trifold-at-ces-2026-pitching-a-phone-tablet-hybrid/articleshow/126364103.cms,"Samsung’s Galaxy Z TriFold emerged as another major attraction at First Look 2026 at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, with the company positioning the device as its latest step in foldable innovation — and a clear attempt to push the phone-tablet idea into a more practical, everyday form factor. Samsung’s pitch rests on the device’s dual personality: a conventional phone experience when closed, and a much larger screen when opened.While it is called a “tri fold,” it technically folds twice but has three panels, and the form factor is being described as a true phone-tablet hybrid that stands apart from bar-style smartphones. The emphasis, according to the inputs, is less on flashy claims and more on everyday utility — “its value appears to lie less in flashy specs about its thinness and more in its utility and practicality.”On physical design, the device is described as impressively slim when open: 3.9mm at its thinnest point and 4.2mm at its thickest , with a weight of 309 grams. When closed, however, the device is noted to be 12.9mm thick, described as “slightly chunky,” even as the cover display is said to feel close to using a non-folding phone.The story, as laid out in the inputs, is that this device is primarily about productivity on the go.The 6.5-inch cover display is positioned for typical phone use, while the 10-inch internal display is meant to provide enough screen real estate to “watch a movie, multitask or type up a paper.” That duality is being framed as the point — and as a niche Samsung believes still isn’t fully addressed by existing book-style foldables.Samsung’s rollout plan, as shared, is already in motion in parts of Asia and the Middle East. The Z TriFold is already available in Korea, China, Taiwan, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. Samsung has also said it will launch in the US in the first quarter of this year, while India is yet to be announced.At the event, TM Roh — Chief Executive Officer, President, and Head of Device eXperience (DX) Division at Samsung Electronics — described the device as a direct response to a long-running industry challenge. He says, “Through years of innovation in foldable form factors, Galaxy Z TriFold solves one of the mobile industry’s longest-standing challenges — delivering the perfect balance between portability, premium performance, and productivity all in one device""The inputs also outline several headline hardware elements Samsung is attaching to the TriFold message: a 200 MP camera, and what is described as the biggest battery Samsung has ever had in a foldable phone. The battery is listed as a 5,600 mAh three-cell battery system, with the detail that it has been placed in each of the three panels of the device for balanced power deliver.Another key engineering detail highlighted is the hinge system. The TriFold uses two differently sized hinges with a dual-rail structure that “work in harmony.” Samsung is also pointing to the way the hinge design supports a slimmer profile, stating that the hinge structure allows the screen panels to meet securely with a minimal gap, enabling the device to be thin and portable.","Samsung’s Galaxy Z TriFold emerged as another major attraction at First Look 2026 at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.

NEW DELHI: With spring-summer dispatches to the US lined up in the next few weeks, a leading leather goods exporter has planned visits to Europe and America to book orders for the next season.The exporter has significant dependence on the American market and has been offering around 20% discount while the buyer has reduced its margin by 7-8% to ensure that made-in-India goods are not disadvantaged compared to rival sources, where tariffs are in the range of 15-20% compared to 50% on Indian products entering the US.""The buyers know that we cannot sustain this as this is more than the profit that we make. These are tough times to keep the order book up,"" said the exporter.He is not alone. Several Indian garment and footwear companies decided to bear a part of the additional burden and also managed to convince the American buyer to reduce the margin, in the hope that they would be able to sustain for a few months before the trade deal, which has been in the pipeline, is finalised.With no clarity on the deal, and US President Donald Trump only ratcheting up the noise on tariffs, exporters are worried about the next season's orders.An industry executive said that some of the American buyers are looking to evaluate India and other comparable markets. ""If the deal is done then they will stick with the Indian seller, otherwise some of them may shift,"" said the executive.An industry veteran said that leather and textiles, both employment-intensive sectors, will be the worst hit if orders move.With a free trade agreement with the European Union in sight, Indian exporters are eyeing opportunities, although it may take several months for the treaty to be ratified after it is finalised by both sides.For exporters, the US remains the focus market. ""You can expect to get an order for 500 pieces with 20 designs from one American buyer. In Europe, you will need 10 buyers and many more designs to reach that number,"" said an exporter.Govt officials indicated that Trump administration officials have gone through what they described as a ""good offer"" but there is no further word on it, leaving exporters to deal with a fresh round of uncertainty just as they prepare for the next season.","Leading leather goods exporter has planned visits to Europe and America to book orders for the next season.

'Can Raise Tariffs Very Quickly': Trump Warns India Over Russian Oil Imports, Praises PM Modi

Tariffs on India

US President Donald Trump, once again boasted about collections from tariffs he has imposed since last year on various countries after his return to White House.""We have taken in, and will soon be receiving, more than 600 Billion Dollars in Tariffs,"" he said in a post on Truth Social, while taking a jab at media whom he called ""fake"" for not covering it. ""The Fake News Media refuses to talk about it because they hate and disrespect our Country, and want to interfere with the upcoming Tariff decision, one of the most important ever, of the United States Supreme Court,"" he added.Further voicing his support behind tariffs, he added, ""Because of Tariffs, our Country is financially, AND FROM A NATIONAL SECURITY STANDPOINT, FAR STRONGER AND MORE RESPECTED THAN EVER BEFORE. GOD BLESS AMERICA!""Trump has criticised the ongoing proceedings in the past as well multiple times. ""The biggest threat in history to United States National Security would be a negative decision on Tariffs by the US Supreme Court,"" cautioning that such a ruling would leave the country ""financially defenseless,"" he had said in the past.Trump's tariffs have been challenged the US Supreme Court on the grounds whether the president overstepped his authority, with last hearing in November, but the final decision pushed to 2026, without much clarity on specific timing.India also faces high tariffs from US, with Donald Trump citing India's trade with Russia for oil. Even, just a day before this tariff collection mention, Trump warned India of higher tariffs if it doesn’t cooperate on the issue of Russian crude oil imports. Currently, Indian shipments face a 50 per cent tariff, half of which is linked to India’s continued imports of Russian crude oil.Also read: Will stopping Russian oil imports ease US pressure on India? Time for a clear call “They wanted to make me happy, basically. Modi is a very good man; he is a good guy. He knew I was not happy, and it was important to make me happy. They do trade and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly. It would be very bad for them,” he said.Trump made the remarks on Sunday while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One during his flight from Florida to Washington, DC.","'We have taken in, and will soon be receiving, more than 600 Billion Dollars in Tariffs,"" he said in a post on Truth Social.

Switzerland froze any assets held in the country by Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro and associates, the governing Federal Council said on Monday, following his arrest by US forces in Caracas and transfer to the United States.The measure, effective immediately and valid for four years, aimed to prevent an outflow of potentially illicit assets and came in addition to existing sanctions imposed on Venezuela since 2018, the statement said.The asset freeze did not affect members of the current Venezuelan government, and Switzerland said it would seek to return any funds found to be illicitly acquired to benefit the Venezuelan people, Reuters reported.The Federal Council said the situation in Venezuela was volatile, with various outcomes possible in the coming days and weeks. It said it was following the situation closely, and called for de-escalation and restraint, while also offering its good offices to find a peaceful solution.""The Federal Council wants to ensure that any illicitly acquired assets cannot be transferred out of Switzerland in the current situation,"" it said.The asset freeze was a precautionary measure and applied to Maduro and his associates as foreign politically exposed persons, the government said.No figures were given and the government did not immediately reply to a request for comment on what, if any assets, Maduro and his associates, held in Switzerland.Meanwhile, Venezuelan President Maduro, along with his wife, Cilia Flores, was expected to appear at noon for a brief but required legal proceeding after they were jailed in Brooklyn following their seizure by the US military from their Caracas home in a surprise raid.As a criminal defendant in the US legal system, Maduro had the same rights as any other person accused of a crime including the right to a trial by a jury of regular New Yorkers.Maduro’s lawyers were expected to contest the legality of his arrest, arguing that he was immune from prosecution as a sovereign head of state.","Switzerland freezes any assets held in the country by Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro and associates.

Kim announced that as of December 2025, SmartThings serves more than 430 million users globally, giving Samsung a scale and depth of insight unmatched by competitors.This insight is reflected in the Family Hub refrigerator, the centrepiece of the connected home. With an upgrade to AI Vision built with Google Gemini, the system improves recognition of food items placed into or removed from the refrigerator, simplifying meal planning and food management.

"Asian stocks today: Markets inch higher amid Venezuela crisis; Nikkei up 1,000 points, Kospi adds 2%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-stocks-today-markets-inch-higher-amid-venezuela-crisis-nikkei-up-1000-points-kospi-adds-2/articleshow/126342619.cms,"Markets across Asia mostly rose on Monday as investors were calculating the impact of the removal of Venezuela's president Nicolas Maduro by US forces. The rally came as traders turned towards the long-running artificial intelligence boom and hopes for more US interest rate cuts.Nikkei soared over 1,419 points or 2.8% to reach at 51, 759. In South Korea, Kospi was up 2.66% to trade at 4,424 at 8:30 AM IST. Shanghai and Shenzhen were up 0.9% and 1.77%, respectively. Hong Kong's HSI was flat with 0.16% gains at 26,381.Equity markets continued their upward momentum from last year, driven by strong demand for artificial intelligence-related stocks. Japan’s Nikkei was led by gains in technology heavyweights, with SoftBank rising about four percent and Tokyo Electron advancing five percent.At the same time, gold prices moved higher, while oil prices, which had slipped earlier in the session, managed to recover some ground. The market moves followed a dramatic US military operation in Caracas early on Saturday, during which American forces struck military installations and transported Maduro and his wife to New York to face federal narcotrafficking charges.The situation has sharpened focus on Venezuela’s energy sector.As the holder of the world’s largest proven oil reserves, Venezuela’s potential return to higher output levels has raised concerns that additional crude supply could worsen global oversupply and further weigh on oil prices.Crude benchmarks also recovered after early weakness in Asian trade. Brent crude rose 0.28% to $60.92 a barrel, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate edged up 0.16% to $57.41.US President Donald Trump said Washington would now “run” Venezuela, with American companies expected to step in to repair the country’s heavily degraded oil infrastructure. Analysts, however, have warned that restoring output will be a long and costly process, clouded by broader uncertainty about the country’s future.Years of sanctions and under-investment have sharply reduced Venezuela’s oil production, which now stands at around one million barrels per day, compared with approximately 3.5 million barrels per day in 1999.“Any recovery in production would require substantial investment given the crumbling infrastructure resulting from years of mismanagement and underinvestment,” UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo told AFP.The outlook for fresh investment remains challenging. Oil prices have been under pressure from a global supply glut and fell in 2025, even as the market grappled with major growth headwinds including Trump’s tariff war and the war in Ukraine.Safe-haven gold also attracted buying interest, rising 1.28% to $4,388 per ounce.","Nikkei soared over 1,419 points or 2.8% to reach at 51, 759.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

The meeting was chaired by Food Secretary Sanjeev Chopra.Out of the total wheat procurement target for the 2022-23 marketing year (April-March), Punjab will aim to procure 2.5 million tonnes wheat, Haryana 1.5 million tonnes and Madhya Pradrsh 2 million tonnes, the food ministry said in a statement.Wheat procurement had declined last year due to a fall in domestic production and higher exports.However, the government has projected a record wheat production at 112.18 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year (July-June) as per the second estimate of the agriculture ministry.Besides wheat, the government has also fixed rabi (winter) rice procurement target at 10.6 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing year.States have been advised to enhance rice milling capacity so that milling of one season gets completed before the commencement of next season and recycling of rice may be avoided.Whereas procurement of millets and coarse grains is estimated to be 7,50,000 tonnes this year, higher than 6,30,000 tonnes in 2021-22. Karnataka will procure 6,00,000 tonnes of millets this year, the statement added.Separately addressing the conference, food minister Piyush Goyal urged all state governments to implement smart-PDS at the earliest.He lauded Andhra Pradesh government's Command Control and stated that the central government will work together for implementing it in other states also.On the storage front, the Union minister said FCI is upgrading godowns into five-star rated ones and state governments can also upgrade their godowns.In the conference, all the state governments were told to learn from the best practice of using millets in schemes like mid-day meal and PDS in Karnataka, which is helpful in adding nutrition and promoting healthy diet.States were encouraged to procure more millets and coarse grains. All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season. Issues related to finalisation of audited accounts, food subsidy claims and rationalisation of food subsidy was also deliberated upon.State governments have also been asked to submit their pending bills to FCI so that those can be settled in March 2023.",The government has fixed a wheat procurement target of 34.15 million tonnes for the 2023-24 marketing year starting April.

India’s GDP growth outlook trimmed to 6.3% as private investment stalls and US tariffs loom: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-gdp-growth-outlook-trimmed-to-6-3-as-private-investment-stalls-and-us-tariffs-loom-report/articleshow/120613489.cms,"AI-generated image

India’s economy is expected to grow at a slower pace in the current fiscal year, weighed down by subdued private sector investment and uncertainty surrounding American tariffs, according to a Reuters survey of economists.The fifth-largest economy in the world is projected to expand at an average rate of 6.3 per cent in FY2024 -25, based on a poll conducted from April 15-24 with participation from 54 economists. While this matches last year’s growth, it marks a slight downgrade from the 6.5 per cent forecast in a March survey. It still remains marginally above the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recent projection of 6.2 per cent.However, this represents a significant drop from the 9.2 per cent GDP growth recorded in fiscal year 2023–24, highlighting a slowdown in momentum.Economists say the headline figures mask deeper structural issues, including the economy’s inability to generate enough high-paying jobs for its growing youth population. Despite government-led infrastructure investments, private sector capital expenditure has remained stagnant over the past decade, leaving India operating below its potential.The situation is further complicated by the proposed 26 per cent US tariff on Indian imports - currently suspended for a 90-day window starting April 10 — which has raised concerns despite India’s services-heavy exports to the US.“Middle-class Indians are struggling. Residential building sales, passenger vehicles, and two-wheeler sales have declined. It’s important that domestic policies address the root causes,” said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Société Générale.“India needs a 1991 moment,” he added, referencing the landmark liberalisation campaign led by then-finance minister Manmohan Singh. “The tariff war offers a perfect opportunity to push for structural reforms. Without them, even as the fastest-growing large economy in a low global growth environment, India may fall well short of its long-term ambition to become a developed nation.”In the survey, most economists said US tariffs have had a negative or severely negative impact on business sentiment. Some described the effect as neutral.“Business sentiment has certainly taken a hit — no business wants to make investment decisions in an uncertain and volatile environment. Investment is the most adversely affected component of the economy due to trade tariffs,” said Kanika Pasricha, chief economic advisor at Union Bank of India.She added that sectors previously poised for growth — including renewables, refineries, steel, and cement — may now scale back or delay capital expenditure plans.Meanwhile, with concerns of a potential US recession and India’s consumer inflation staying below the 4 per cent medium-term target for two straight months, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to continue its moderate rate-cutting cycle. The central bank is likely to reduce rates by 25 basis points in June to 5.75 per cent, and possibly conclude the easing cycle in August at 5.50 per cent, according to the survey.“The unexpected drop in inflation... has created greater scope for monetary policy support to growth,” noted Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ.For FY2024–25, consumer inflation is projected to average 4.0 per cent, rising slightly to 4.3 per cent in the following fiscal year.This report based on Reuters survey comes days after the World Bank revised its prediction on India's growth to 6.3 per cent for FY 2025-26, cut from its previous estimate of 6.7 per cent.According to the report, as quoted by news agency PTI, ""In India, growth is expected to slow from 6.5 per cent in FY2024-25 to 6.3 per cent in FY 2025-26, as the benefits to private investment from monetary easing and regulatory streamlining are expected to be offset by global economic weakness and policy uncertainty.""The organisation's assessment indicates that India's current fiscal performance fell short of projections, primarily due to reduced private sector investments and unfulfilled public capital expenditure objectives.Read more: World Bank cuts India’s FY26 growth forecast to 6.3% citing global headwinds","The fifth-largest economy in the world is projected to expand at an average rate of 6.3 per cent in FY2024 -25, based on a poll conducted from April 15-24 with participation from 54 economists.

According to Bajaj Broking Research, Lemon Treel Hotels and Electrosteel Castings are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for April 25, 2025:

Index View: NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty after a strong rally of 5,800 points or 11% in just seven sessions, witnessed marginal profit booking in the last two sessions. The recent rally was led by robust institutional accumulation in frontline banking counters and a notable revival in FII inflows—reflecting a clear risk-on undertone. Rate cut hopes and positive results of the large cap private Banks boosted sentiment. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued the final guidelines on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), significantly easing norms and providing a substantial boost to system-wide liquidity thus helping to improve sentiments for the financial companies.

Bank Nifty has rallied to a fresh all time high and has generated a breakout above 7 months broader range (54,450-48,000). It has also registered a faster retracement of the five-month correction in just two months, signaling renewed strength.

Daily stochastic has approached overbought territory after an 11% rally in just 7 sessions. Hence, failure to move above 56,000 levels will lead to some consolidation in the range of 54,400-56,000 in the coming sessions. The immediate support base is placed at 54,000-54,400 levels, being the Monday’s gap area and the recent major breakout area.

While a breakout above 56,000 levels will open upwards towards 56,800 zones in the coming weeks. Additionally, the Bank Nifty/Nifty ratio chart has broken out of a consolidation range, suggesting continued relative outperformance in the medium term.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices traded in a range with corrective bias on the Monthly expiry session on Thursday after surging nearly 9% over the preceding seven sessions, fueled by a mix of positive factors. Heavyweight stock buying, a weakening U.S. dollar, and declining crude oil prices boosted overall investor sentiment. The rally gained further traction with progress in trade talks with the U.S. and the extension of reciprocal tariff exemptions. Banking stocks were at the forefront of the gains as Bank Nifty rallied to a fresh all time high, lifted by easing of CPI data and an encouraging monsoon forecast—both of which reinforced expectations of a more aggressive rate-cutting cycle by the Reserve Bank of India.Nifty during the current week extended up move and formed a fresh high for CY25 at 24,359. The index closed the Thursday session at 24,246 levels.Index trends remain firmly positive, we expect the index to maintain a positive bias and head towards 24,550 being the 61.8% retracement of the entire decline (26277-21743) and then towards the December 2024 high of 24,850 in the upcoming weeks. Only a breach below Wednesday low (24120) will signal a pause in the current up trend.The daily stochastic is placed at an overbought territory after a sharp 1,900-point rally in the past 8 sessions. Hence, some consolidation at higher levels cannot be ruled out. A breach below Wednesday's low (24,120) can lead to some consolidation in the range of 24,350-23,800.We revise the support base higher towards 23,800 levels, being the Monday’s gap area and the recent breakout area. Index sustaining above the same will keep the short-term bias positive and dips should be viewed as buying opportunities. Stock specific action will continue to remain under focus as we progress through the Q4 earnings season.The stock has generated a breakout above a falling supply line joining highs of January and February 2025 signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity. The stock is also sustaining above the short- and long-term moving averagesWe expect the stock to maintain positive bias and head towards 162 levels in the medium term being the previous major high of January 2025.The share price of Electrosteel Castings has generated a breakout above the last 2 months range (108-88) signaling reversal of the corrective trend and also closed above the 50 days EMA.The daily 14 period RSI is in uptrend thus supports the positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 128 levels in the medium term being measuring implication of the last 2 months range breakout (108-88).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Lemon Treel Hotels and Electrosteel Castings are the top stock picks for today.

MUMBAI: India-Pakistan border tensions spooked Dalal Street investors on Friday, with the sensex closing 589 points down at 79,213 points, while Nifty on the NSE lost 207 points to 24,039 points. Some profit-taking after a seven-session gain that added about 8.5% to each of the indices also led to the slide in the indices, market players said.After opening marginally higher, sensex lost steam and dipped to the day's low at 78,606 points, down nearly 1,200 points from Thursday's close. However, end-of-the-session buying, mainly by foreign funds , helped it recover part of its early losses.Although both sensex and Nifty closed less than 1% lower, the selloff was severe outside blue-chip stocks.As a result, BSE's midcap index closed 2.4% down, while the smallcap index was down 2.6%. According to Vinod Nair of Geojit Investments, investor sentiment turned cautious amid escalating tensions along the Indo-Pak border. ""Mid and smallcap stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off, driven by their elevated valuations and growing concerns over potential earnings downgrades following a muted start to the earnings season."" The day's selloff left investors poorer by Rs 8 lakh crore, with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 421.6 lakh crore.The slide in the leading indices came despite a Rs 2,952-crore net buying by foreign funds, BSE data showed. After remaining bearish on India for several months, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) are showing signs of being bullish again. Since April 16, FPIs net bought stocks worth Rs 31,200 crore (about $3.7 billion), data from NSDL and BSE showed.

Insourcing: 'Mid-mkt' centres drive GCC boom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/insourcing-mid-mkt-centres-drive-gcc-boom/articleshow/120633737.cms,"HYDERABAD: India's mid-market GCCs ( global capability centres ) are experiencing a surge, outshining their peers by unlocking new opportunities. This growth is creating a flywheel effect, allowing them to leverage a diverse talent pool. India has over 480 mid-market GCCs, with 2.1 lakh employees, as shown in a Nasscom-Zinnov report.Mid-market GCCs are capability centres set up by mid-sized firms with annual revenue ranging from $100 million to $1 billion. They represent 27% of all GCCs and 22% of total units in the country. In the last five years, more than 110 new facilities were set up, representing approximately 35% of all new GCC units in India within this period.About 60% of end-to-end platform ownership in enterprise portfolios is driven from India by mid-market GCCs. Significant work is being done across AI/ML, cybersecurity, cloud, and data science. India hosts 47% of global product management talent and 25% of the deeptech workforce for mid-market GCCs.Pari Natarajan, CEO and co-founder of global management company Zinnov, said that in mid-market companies, private equity ownership plays a significant role.These private equity firms implement structured value creation strategies, with India-based GCCs being a crucial component. ""When such centres don't exist, establishing them becomes a strategic board-level directive. For mid-market firms without private equity backing, the push towards India centres comes from board members who serve as operational leaders,"" he said.North American firms, the report said, show a higher propensity to globalise, and India becomes an ideal destination given the learning agility and depth in the talent. The key destinations for mid-market GCCs continue to be Bengaluru, Hyderabad, NCR, and Chennai, which collectively host 74% of new GCC establishments. Notably, Hyderabad has evolved into a significant talent hub for mid-market GCCs during the past five years, accounting for 25% of the workforce expansion.Mid-market GCCs focus on delivering high-value, specialised services while maintaining a leaner operational model compared to larger GCCs. Mid-market GCCs promote talent to site leadership 20% faster, enabled by leaner structures, early ownership, and direct visibility to global leaders.While mid-market GCCs often start as outposts like their larger peers, they tend to progress 1.2 times faster along the maturity curve.","India has over 480 mid-market GCCs, with 2.1 lakh employees, as shown in a Nasscom-Zinnov report.

NEW DELHI: It may be 'Advantage India' for iPhone manufacturing post the US-China tariff war, but Apple does not have any plans to shift production of MacBooks and iPads to India in near future. This is due to the small size of domestic consumption and complexities in setting up supply chain ecosystem, sources have said.However, in what may be seen as a silver lining for India, Apple has started a feasibility study to consider broadening the India manufacturing base beyond iPhones and AirPods, the sources have told TOI. Apple's reluctance to manufacture MacBooks here is particularly not a good news for govt as it will not be able to attract the world's biggest electronics seller to make laptops in India. This is despite announcing a revised and much bigger Rs 17,000 crore IT hardware manufacturing PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme in 2023, against previous Rs 7,350 crore scheme.""Apple is surely looking at India for more manufacturing, but a lot of this will be concentrated around iPhones, where the supply chain and capacities are robust and large-scale. The tariff situation and US tensions with China, however, have opened up the prospects of a feasibility on MacBooks and even the iPads,"" one of the sources said.Speaking about the reluctance in shifting the production of MacBooks and iPads, the source said the company has told the govt about a ""limited sales market"" for the products in India.""This is not the case with iPhones as local sales are robust and thus it helps in being closer to the market through production. Another key factor in not shifting MacBooks and iPad production to India is the fact that it will take three-to-four years to set up a credible and strong supply chain here, much of which will also need to be shifted from China. Also, there is sufficient capacity for the products globally and there is not much need to set up another base,"" the source said.The company has found a sweet spot in India when it comes to making iPhones and has earmarked its factories here as one of the biggest hubs for manufacturing the smartphones beyond China, which was previously the single-largest base. ""The idea is to expand in India when it comes to iPhones, not just due to the tariffs but also in line with the China+1 strategy,"" another source said.At present, Taiwan's Foxconn and Tata group are making iPhones in India and these are primarily being shipped to Apple's home market in the US as tariffs from China are higher. ""A long-term plan is to make India the key hub for supplying iPhones to the US.""",Apple does not have any plans to shift production of MacBooks and iPads to India. This is due to the small size of domestic consumption and complexities in setting up supply chain ecosystem. Apple has started a feasibility study to consider broadening the India manufacturing base.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120633666,imgsize-374727,width-400,resizemode-4/120633666.jpg"
Maruti goes slow on new plant amid sluggish sales,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/maruti-goes-slow-on-new-plant-amid-sluggish-sales/articleshow/120633640.cms,"NEW DELHI: Maruti Suzuki has decided to go slow on land acquisition for a planned Rs 35,000-crore second factory in Gujarat due to poor growth in car sales. This factory was aimed at taking the company's production capacity to four million (40 lakh) units by 2030-31.When asked whether the company has gone slow on the project, Maruti chairman R C Bhargava said, ""There is no delay, (but) there is no hurry about doing anything there because market growth is 1-2%. Why would I put up another million units in a hurry? Unless the market shows there is a need.""Bhargava said Maruti has sufficient expansion work going in its present factories at Haryana and Gujarat. ""I have enough capacity to come up in Kharkhoda (Haryana). Some are coming up in Manesar, (and) some are coming up in Gujarat's first plant. There is no hurry about the Gujarat's second plant. The site has not yet been finalised.""The despondent mood at the country's biggest carmaker highlights the worry in the broader car industry. The industry had enjoyed strong growth in the post-Covid period but is increasingly finding the going tough as higher prices of vehicles and uncertainties around the economy and stock markets are keeping buyers away.Companies are having a relook at new investment plans as they fear overcapacity may come to haunt businesses if the slowdown persists.Bhargava said to kickstart demand, there is a need for govt support for creation of an all-new segment of entry-level cars - smaller than the Alto. This, he said, will prompt more two-wheeler buyers to upgrade to cars, something which is not happening today as car prices, even in the entry segments have gone up by around Rs 90,000 due to govt mandates on safety and emissions.""There is an example of Japanese kei cars. They have different sets of regulations compared to other cars and taxes (on them) are much lower. They are smaller and cheaper and more affordable. That's how Japan switched from two-wheelers to cars. We need to do a similar thing here.""He added that developing a highly-affordable mini car is quite challenging, even for a mass-maker like Maruti, and thus there is a need for govt support. ""Today no one can develop at that cost, not even the Chinese.""On whether the income tax relief in the Union Budget will help in boosting car sales, he said it looks difficult as car prices have moved up substantially and people will also use the additional income for other household work. ""People have other expenditure and will not use it (income tax relief) to buy cars. They have other priorities.""",The despondent mood at the country's biggest carmaker highlights the worry in the broader car industry.

MUMBAI: Reliance Industries , India's largest company in terms of market value, reported a 6% increase in quarterly profit to Rs 22,611 crore on Friday. This was driven by the strong performance of its digital and retail businesses, which offset the weakness in its traditional oil-to-chemicals (O2C) unit.Revenue totalled over Rs 2.64 lakh crore, up about 10%. Operating profit, a yardstick for underlying business performance, increased 3% to Rs 46,471 crore. Expenses climbed by about 11% to Rs 2.4 lakh crore. Operating profit of O2C fell by 10% to Rs 15,080 crore due to a sharp decline in transportation fuel cracks and lower polyester chain margins.Operating profit of the digital services business (Jio) surged 18% to Rs 17,278 crore due to higher subscriber numbers and the continued impact of the cellular tariff hike implemented last year. The residual impact of the tariff hike is expected to flow through by June this year, RIL said. Jio's average revenue per user (ARPU) - a key metric that influences income - was Rs 206 in Q4FY25, up by about 14%. Launched in 2016, Jio had 488 million customers as of March 31, 2025, and saw data and voice traffic growth of about 20% and 4% on its network, respectively. Operating profit of the retail business shot up by 14% to Rs 6,721 crore due to improved efficiencies and a sharper product mix.Operating profit of the oil & gas business declined nearly 9% to Rs 5,123 crore due to higher operating costs resulting from one-time maintenance activity and govt levies.","Revenue totalled over Rs 2.64 lakh crore, up about 10%.

Will high gold prices dampen Akshay Tritiya? What are jewellers doing to boost sales,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-high-gold-prices-dampen-akshay-tritiya-what-are-jewellers-doing-to-boost-sales/articleshow/120625236.cms,"Would high gold prices weaken the festive sentiment?

Jewellers are expecting consumer demand to be driven by light weighing ornaments on this Akshaya Tritiya, as gold prices are soaring to the historic highs of Rs 1 lakh. Akshay Tritiya , set to be celebrated on April 30, is considered an auspicious day to buy gold, hence often bringing a surge in the yellow metal’s purchases across India. However, with current rates testing consumer patience, the industry is adapting to the mood with smaller, more affordable designs and a wider range of products.""As we approach the auspicious occasion of Akshaya Tritiya, the gold market is buzzing with anticipation,"" said Rajesh Rokde, chairman of the All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC). ""Akshaya Tritiya holds immense cultural significance in India, traditionally marking a surge in gold purchases.""Despite the skyrocketing prices, this year could still provide a healthy demand driven by light weight items, Rokde further told PTI.Gold traded weak at Rs 95,075 per 10 grams on Friday on MCX, as international prices faced resistance near the $3,330-an-ounce mark. Still, the symbolic value of gold is expected to outweigh short-term hesitation from buyers.Rokde said that even though some consumers might be hesitant, the appeal of gold as a safe-haven asset and the metal being an integral part of traditions will likely translate into positive sales.To further boost the sentiment, the jewel industry is also rolling out a diverse range of items for customers to choose from, catering to a spectrum of budgets and preferences, he said.Avinash Gupta, GJC's vice-chairman also echoed a similar view, saying, though high prices might prompt some to resort to caution, the cultural significance of the yellow metal, aided with its status of being a reliable asset, would ultimately suggest an upward trend in buying.""High prices may keep the volume demand either the same as last year or bring it down by 10 per cent. The jewellery sector is showcasing innovative designs alongside classic pieces to cater to diverse consumer needs,"" he added.“Gold purchases have traditionally been an integral part of Akshaya Tritiya celebrations for millions of Indians, symbolising prosperity and good fortune,” said Sachin Jain, regional CEO, India, World Gold Council.“We are currently witnessing sky rocketing gold prices - 'gold's era'. This year marks a significant period for gold, with global prices increasing by 25 per cent since January and reaching a record high of $3,500 per ounce.”From traditional buyers to digital-savvy investors, demand is expected to span across jewellery, coins, bars, gold ETFs, and digital gold.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman and MD of PNG jewellers, said the festive buzz is undeterred by high prices. “Volume has been under pressure for quite some time as the gold prices continue to soar. However, with Akshay Tritiya falling at the cusp of a packed wedding season, we are optimistic that it will mirror the encouraging performance we saw during Gudi Padwa. We anticipate a strong turnout both for fresh purchases and for deliveries scheduled on the day,” he said.Gadgil expected old bars and coins to perform well as consumers continue to look at gold as a safe, long-term asset. “The next 10 days will be crucial in shaping momentum, but all indicators point to a promising Akshay Tritiya ahead,"" he added.”","Akshay Tritiya is considered an auspicious day to buy gold, hence often bringing a surge in the yellow metal’s purchases across India.

"Roche could have earned over 100 times what it cost for rare disease drug, estimate activists",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/roche-could-have-earned-over-100-times-what-it-cost-for-rare-disease-drug-estimate-activists/articleshow/120624790.cms,"File photo: AP

Pharma major Roche may have earned over a hundred times what risdiplam , a drug used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), should cost to bring to market, according to calculations by public health activists.After Roche declined to share information on the cost of clinical trials, Knowledge Ecology International (KEI), a US-based non-profit working on access to affordable medicines, calculated the costs and pegged them at about $50 million. Roche earned $5.8 billion from the sale of risdiplam in the 2021-2024 period, about 115 times the calculated cost.In response to the calculations sent to it by KEI, Roche stated: “Only a small fraction of projects make it ‘from bench to bedside’ and we have to absorb the cost of failing projects as well, while your calculation only addresses successful development. Similarly, our dedication to innovation extends to the continuous development of next-generation therapies—a commitment clearly reflected in our ongoing development work of new treatments in SMA. ”The three trials of risdiplam cited in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) involved 467 participants. The four trials with a start date before FDA approval involved 120 participants. KEI estimated per patient cost of conducting the trial by combining several data sources on the cost of conducting clinical trials.The United States provides a tax credit for qualifying clinical trials for rare diseases. After calculating the cost of the clinical trials, when KEI applied the orphan drug tax credit to the trial cost, the net cost ranged from $11 million to $25 million.Clinical trials typically constitute 60-70% of drug development costs.Roche was also awarded a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) in August 2020. The PRV is an incentive designed to encourage development of drugs and biologics for serious or life-threatening rare diseases. The PRV allows earlier market entry and extends the effective period of the monopoly by several months. The PRV can be sold to third parties. In 2020, the market value of a PRV was roughly $100 million, more than the Roche outlays on trials, pointed out KEI.Since 2003, when it was established, the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation (SMAF) has invested $100 million to develop drugs for this condition. Roche paid $30 million dollars to get an exclusive worldwide license to PTC Therapeutics' SMA programme, which it had developed in collaboration with SMAF.Roche’s costs of manufacturing the drug are not significant, with a year of treatment requiring less than 2 grams of risdiplam, which can probably be manufactured by Roche at less than $50,000 per kilo, or $50 per gram, estimated KEI. In India, the treatment with risdiplam typically costs Rs 72 lakh per adult patient per year, which is unaffordable for most.According to Roche’s response to TOI, as of October 2024, of the 168 patients receiving Roche’s treatment for SMA, 56 continued to be treated for free under the company’s Compassionate User Program (CUP), 53 were covered under various government policies -- Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Defence, Employee State Insurance (ESI) and Railways -- and the remaining 59 purchased the drug under Roche’s Patient Access Program, launched in 2021, “under which Roche provides free bottles of the treatment for every bottle that is purchased”.Cure SMA, a trust formed by parents of children with SMA, has 1,800 patients registered and the government portal for rare disease has 700 SMA patients registered.Lack of affordability has made patients approach courts to help bring down costs through local manufacture or through price negotiation by the government. Roche has opposed generic manufacture of the drug by an Indian company. A bottle of risdiplam costs Rs 2 lakh in India while it costs just Rs 44,700 in China and Rs 41,000 in Pakistan, according to an affidavit filed by an SMA patient in court. The Indian generic manufacturer, NATCO, has pegged the cost at Rs 15,900 per bottle with scope for further reduction if the government purchased it in bulk.“On average, it takes ten years to develop a new drug and only one out of ten drugs in early development will eventually make it to patients. And it is very complex to estimate the total cost of developing a new medicine, especially for extremely rare neurological diseases such as SMA. The cost of development goes well beyond preclinical research, clinical trials, and post-marketing studies, requiring many years of investment. There are also costs associated with ensuring safe and quality manufacturing setup and operations, and building a global and local infrastructure to ensure access around the world.,” stated Roche in its response to TOI.","Roche earned $5.8 billion from the sale of risdiplam in the 2021-2024 period, about 115 times the calculated cost.

California has overtaken Japan in terms of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) — a milestone highlighted by Governor Gavin Newsom , who warned that President Donald Trump's tariff policies could endanger the state’s growing prosperity.According to preliminary figures from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, California posted a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $4.1 trillion in 2024. This is higher than Japan’s $4.02 trillion GDP for the same period, as reported by the International Monetary Fund.This places California just behind the United States, China and Germany in total economic output, with the state’s economy growing by 6 per cent in 2024 — outpacing all three of those nations.“California isn’t just keeping pace with the world — we’re setting the pace,” Newsom said in a statement Wednesday according to CNN. “Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritise sustainability, and believe in the power of innovation.”However, Newsom cautioned that the state’s economic progress is under threat from what he called “the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration.”“California’s economy powers the nation, and it must be protected,” he added.Also read: Donald Trump tariffs to hit global economy hard!

The suit argues that these measures are inflicting economic harm on California’s businesses and residents.The legal filing contests Trump’s authority to enact tariffs on key trading partners — Mexico, China and Canada — under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), citing a 10 per cent blanket tariff on all imports. Newsom's team argues the move is “unlawful and unprecedented” without congressional approval.Enacted in 1977, the IEEPA grants presidents broad powers to implement economic sanctions during national emergencies, but requires consultation with Congress.California recorded $675 billion in two-way trade in 2024, with Mexico, Canada and China serving as its primary trading partners. These three countries alone accounted for over 40 per cent of the state’s imports — $203 billion of the $491 billion total.Twelve other states joined California in filing lawsuits on Wednesday, accusing the Trump administration of implementing tariffs that amount to illegal tax hikes. The White House dismissed the coordinated legal challenge as a “witch hunt.”","California has overtaken Japan in terms of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Governor Gavin Newsom warned that President Donald Trump's tariff policies could endanger the state’s growing prosperity.

In a policy shift aimed at accelerating US leadership in autonomous vehicle technology , the Trump administration is easing federal safety regulations to help domestic automakers like Elon Musk ’s Tesla stay ahead of Chinese rivals.The US department of transportation on Thursday unveiled a new framework that allows American companies to seek exemptions from certain safety rules when testing self-driving cars for non-commercial purposes—such as research and public demonstrations.""We’re in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn’t be higher,” said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement, justifying the move. “Our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard ,"" he added.The move is intended to give US automakers greater flexibility as they push to develop fully autonomous vehicles.The administration is also revising crash reporting requirements for self-driving systems, a move directly addressing longstanding complaints from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has argued the rules are overly burdensome. Tesla, as the leading seller of partially automated vehicles in the US, has been disproportionately impacted by current reporting demands.While the obligation to report crashes will remain, the Transportation Department says it will be “loosened” to remove “unnecessary and duplicative” requirements—striking a balance between regulatory oversight and technological progress.The announcement comes just a day after Musk told investors that Tesla will begin rolling out self-driving taxis in Austin, Texas, this June. As China’s BYD and other rivals rapidly scale up their autonomous vehicle programs, the pressure is mounting on the US to respond.Previously, such exemptions were granted primarily to foreign vehicles entering the US market whose home-country regulations differed from those in the US.Also read: ‘India a very hot market but...’: Elon Musk-led Tesla says 100% car tariffs make customers anxious The incentive for Tesla comes just days after the automaker reported a stark drop of 71 per cent in profits in its Q1 earnings report.

Tesla showrooms throughout Europe and the United States have faced vandalism and boycott actions, triggered by Musk's endorsement of public sector reductions and his alignment with far-right personalities abroad. Protesters in Milan displayed an effigy of Musk, whilst demonstrators in Berlin and London branded Tesla vehicles as ""Swasticars.""Soon after the reports were released, Musk stated his intent on shifting focus back to Tesla.

Most Asian stocks climbed on Friday, driven by a strong rally on Wall Street, robust quarterly earnings from Alphabet, and renewed optimism around trade relations under US President Donald Trump.While most stocks showed positive trend, Indian stock indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50 , opened higher, but later plunged 700 points with the Sensex at 78,962.42 and Nifty50 also down at 23,926.95 during early trade. This came after seven days of gains, with the market pausing on Thursday, ending in the red due to cautious investor sentiment. Foreign portfolio investors made net purchases of Rs 8,250 crore, while domestic investors sold Rs 534 crore. Market direction will likely depend on global trends and upcoming Q4 earnings.Meanwhile, Tokyo’s Nikkei rose 1 per cent, with gains also seen in Hong Kong and Shanghai. The Nikkei’s rise came despite a major profit warning from Nissan, which projected losses of up to $5.3 billion for fiscal 2024–25. Still, shares of the automaker jumped more than 3 per cent on Friday. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tatsuo Yoshida said markets recognize Nissan is “moving ahead toward turnaround,” noting that booking impairment losses and restructuring charges is a necessary step forward.Seoul’s benchmark index gained 0.5 per cent after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested a potential trade ""understanding"" with South Korea could be reached by next week.Positive momentum extended across other Asia-Pacific markets, including Taipei, Sydney, Singapore, Manila, and Wellington.Investor sentiment was further lifted by Alphabet’s impressive quarterly results. The Google parent reported a $34.5 billion profit for the quarter, with revenue up 12 per cent year-over-year to $90.2 billion. Its cloud division saw especially strong growth, rising 28 per cent to $12.3 billion.Read more: Google parent Alphabet reports 12% revenue surge in Q1, $34.5 billion profit driven by Cloud and AI growth This comes after US equities extended gains for a third consecutive session on Thursday, even as prospects for trade agreements with China and the European Union remained uncertain.Also read: Wall Street rallies on strong corporate earnings despite lingering trade war jitters Meanwhile, Beijing dismissed recent reports of ongoing trade talks with Washington as “groundless,” countering Trump’s optimistic remarks about potentially reducing steep tariffs on Chinese imports. Meanwhile, France’s economy minister Eric Lombard noted that a US-EU trade agreement remains a distant prospect.Despite these mixed signals, international markets remained resilient. “There are mixed signals about whether there have been some talks about trade between the US and China,” said Lloyd Chan, senior currency analyst at MUFG, in comments to AFP. “Nonetheless, the trade war and US policy-related uncertainty have persisted. Asian economies still face the risk of higher reciprocal tariffs,” he added.Adding to the optimism, Chan pointed to a growing possibility of earlier-than-expected interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Fed Governor Christopher Waller indicated support for easing policy should steep tariffs begin to weigh on employment.","Indian stock indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50, opened higher, but later plunged 700 points.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has amassed $300.87 billion in US Treasury bills, accounting for nearly 5% of the entire short-term government debt market.As of March 2025, the total US Treasury bill market stood at $6.15 trillion, which means Berkshire controls approximately 4.89% of it—equivalent to nearly one in every twenty dollars in circulation, according to an ET report.The move highlights Buffett's focus on safety and liquidity amid high stock valuations and ongoing global economic uncertainty. The report also noted that Berkshire’s T-bill holdings now exceed those of the US Federal Reserve, which owns just over $195 billion in similar securities.More than 90% of Berkshire’s $334 billion cash reserves are invested in short-term government debt.

Tariff worries continue hanging over companies as they report their latest financial results and try to provide guidance on their path ahead.Some tariffs remain in place against key U.S. trading partners, but others have been postponed to give nations time to negotiate. The tariff and trade picture continues shifting and that makes it difficult for companies and investors to make a reliable assessment of any impact to costs and sales.Seemingly few industries or companies are being spared from the uncertainty. Food and beverage businesses, pharmaceutical companies, and makers of household staples are among the many companies trying to gauge the potential impact to costs and sales.A new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that companies are right to be focused on tariffs. About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are ""extremely"" or ""very"" concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or applianceHere's what companies are saying about tariffs and their potential impact:Procter & Gamble, the maker of such products as Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, said Thursday said it's doing whatever it can to reduce higher costs from President Donald Trump's expansive tariffs from shifting sourcing to changing formulation to avoid duties.But P&G's Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten told reporters on a call that the consumer products giant still will likely have to pass on higher prices to shoppers as early as July.The consumer product giant reduced its annual financial outlook after reporting lower sales, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe, during the latest quarter, due to a pullback in consumer spending over worries about tariffs as well as overall financial worries about job security and mortgage rates.""Everything plays into the consumer behavior,"" Schulten said. ""Uncertainty around the stock market and what their 401ks are worth and what the portfolio is worth. Uncertainty around the economic outlook and what it means for their livelihood and the job market.""PepsiCo lowered its full-year earnings expectations, citing increased costs from tariffs and a pullback in consumer spending.The maker of Pepsi beverages and Frito-Lay snacks said it now expects its core earnings per share to be even with last year. Previously it expected mid-single-digit percentage growth.A 25% tariff on imported aluminum is among those hitting PepsiCo and other beverage makers. The company expects ""elevated levels of volatility and uncertainty"" for the rest of this year.Merck trimmed its earnings forecast for the year, though it maintained its guidance for revenue.The pharmaceutical giant has a global reach. Half of its revenue comes from the U.S. market, with the rest of the world making up the other half, according to FactSet. The company expects tariffs already implemented to cost the company about $200 million.American Airlines American Airlines withdrew its earnings forecast for the year amid uncertainty over the economy.While tariffs might not directly impact airlines and other companies in the travel sector, they could prompt a shift in consumer spending. Tariffs typically make goods more expensive and that might force consumers to tighten their budgets and focus more on necessities, while cutting back on discretionary items and services, such as travel.","Some tariffs remain in place against key U.S. trading partners, but others have been postponed.

Wall Street rallies on strong corporate earnings despite lingering trade war jitters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stock-markets-dow-jones-industrial-index-nasdaq-sp-500-us-china-trade-deal-hopes-stay-murky/articleshow/120587807.cms,"US stocks rallied Thursday as a wave of better-than-expected corporate earnings lifted investor sentiment, though concerns about ongoing trade tensions and economic uncertainty continue to loom over Wall Street.According to the Associated Press, the S&P 500 climbed 1.9% in late trading, narrowing the gap to within 11% of its all-time high set earlier this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 450 points, or 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 2.5%, as strong performance from major tech and industrial companies buoyed markets.A standout contributor to the rally was ServiceNow, which saw its stock jump 15.8% after reporting first-quarter profits for 2025 that exceeded analyst expectations. The AI-powered enterprise software company also issued an upbeat forecast for subscription revenue, further boosting investor confidence.Southwest Airlines also delivered stronger-than-anticipated earnings, despite uncertainty clouding the broader economic outlook. CEO Bob Jordan emphasized the company is ""controlling what we can control,"" announcing plans to reduce flight schedules in the second half of the year.Southwest’s stock fluctuated through the day before ending up 3.2%.Rival American Airlines joined in pulling its full-year guidance due to economic unpredictability but saw its stock rise 3.3% after beating quarterly profit estimates. Many companies, spanning various industries, echoed similar concerns about issuing financial forecasts amid the volatile climate created by Trump’s trade policies.The trade war, sparked by the on-again-off-again imposition of tariffs by President Donald Trump , has left businesses and investors grappling with shifting headlines and economic consequences. Optimism over a softening stance on tariffs had lifted markets earlier in the week, but that was shaken Thursday when China denied being in active negotiations with the US, likening reports of progress to “trying to catch the wind.”Tan Jing Yi of Mizuho Bank’s Asia & Oceania Treasury Department described Trump’s trade strategy as “headline turbulence,” warning of long-term harm to global economies and adding that sentiment continues to swing wildly “from hopes of intense relief to inflicted economic gloom.”The market’s week has been marked by extreme swings—beginning with sharp losses on trade fears and now rebounding on strong earnings—reflecting the lack of clarity around future economic policies. “It’s an unhealthy market backdrop right now, and we’re trying not to react too much,” said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.Despite the broader uncertainty, several companies delivered standout earnings results. Toymaker Hasbro saw its shares soar 15.6% after reporting stronger-than-expected profit and revenue, citing continued growth of its Magic: The Gathering card game. Semiconductor giant Texas Instruments also impressed, rallying 6.2% on better-than-forecast earnings.However, not all earnings news was positive. Consumer goods titan Procter & Gamble fell 3.6% even after beating profit expectations. The company’s revenue came in below forecasts, and it trimmed its full-year profit outlook, citing a $200 million earnings hit from higher commodity costs.PepsiCo similarly warned of challenges ahead. CEO Ramon Laguarta highlighted “more volatility and uncertainty,” with subdued consumer demand and higher costs due to tariffs—including a 25% import tariff on aluminum cans—contributing to a 5% drop in the company’s shares after it lowered its profit forecast for 2025.In the bond market, Treasury yields eased, with the 10-year yield falling to 4.30% from 4.40% the previous day. The decline followed a report showing that slightly more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week than anticipated. Additionally, March saw a sharper-than-expected drop in sales of previously owned homes, further signaling potential economic softening.Overseas, stock markets in Europe and Asia saw modest and mixed movements, reflecting the global ripple effects of trade policy uncertainties and economic concerns.While the earnings season has provided a temporary lift, market watchers agree that volatility is likely to persist until clearer signals emerge about the direction of US trade and fiscal policy. For now, Wall Street appears to be navigating a delicate balance between strong current performance and an unpredictable future.","US stocks rallied Thursday as a wave of better-than-expected corporate earnings lifted investor sentiment.

Unsettled tariff policies and unpredictable trade war is weighing down companies as they try to provide investors with any financial outlooks in the latest financial results.While some tariffs on key US trading partners remain, others have been temporarily postponed to allow room for negotiations. However, the constantly shifting policies often changing by the day, have left businesses struggling to assess the impact on their costs and revenues.On Tuesday, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent struck a cautiously optimistic note, saying he expected a “de-escalation” in the trade war with China . However, he also acknowledged that formal negotiations are yet to begin.Here’s how some of the biggest companies are handling the uncertainty:Chipotle Mexican Grill on Wednesday said that the costs are increasing due to the tariffs. The chain sources beef from Australia, avocados from Colombia and Peru and packaging from Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand. All the materials are now subjected to a 10% tariff.CFO Adam Rymer warned that tariffs could also drive up the cost of building new restaurants, as its Chinese-sourced equipment and materials would be affected, though the situation with China is still unpredictable.The food giant reported lower-than-expected revenue for the first quarter and cut its full-year forecast for same-store sales.CEO Scott Boatwright blamed economic anxiety, saying it was the “overwhelming reason” for a decline in customer visits, an issue that has persisted into April.Tesla appears better positioned than many automakers, thanks to its largely domestic production. However, its energy division could take a hit due to reliance on LFP battery cells from China.The EV manufacturer could also face a major setback, as China being the world's largest electric market has also retaliated against the US.Earlier this month, Tesla suspended orders for its Model S and X in mainland China, another blow amid potential retaliation from Beijing, the world’s largest EV market.CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of President Trump, said he still supported “lower tariffs,” calling them a route to prosperity, but acknowledged that trade decisions ultimately lie with the president.Dutch multinational Akzo Nobel said its exposure to US tariffs is limited thanks to years of strategic localisation. CEO Gregoire Poux-Guillaume told analysts, “Over the years, we deliberately localized both our procurement and production in the US.”“We also largely run China for China and use the rest of Asia instead as an export base.”The company deals in a range of products, from paints and coatings for the automotive industry to the diy homeowners. However, major tariffs could still hurt businesses and sales.Medical device maker Boston Scientific expects most of the tariff pain to hit later this year, estimating a $200 million impact in 2025. Still, the company raised its earnings and revenue outlook, confident it can absorb the costs through stronger sales and belt-tightening.With a long-established global supply chain and significant US investment, Boston Scientific said that it was prepared to ride out the storm.Aircraft giant Boeing said most of its supply chain is US-based and that many imports from Canada and Mexico are protected under current trade agreements. Tariffs on other suppliers, including Japan and Italy, are expected to be recoverable, with a net cost of less than $500 million annually.Yet the aeroplane manufacturer is more concerned about retaliation from key markets, especially China, which has already halted deliveries of its aircraft.Telecoms giant AT&T said it is bracing for potential increases in the cost of mobile phones and network equipment. However, it believes that it can manage the fallout for now, based on the current pause in tariffs and supply chain.“The magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs the vendors pass on, the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand,” said CEO John Stankey.",Chipotle Mexican Grill said that the costs are increasing due to the tariffs.

At present, they are subjected to a 10 per cent tariff under the existing trade policy introduced during the Trump administration.“India also has fewer non-tariff trade barriers, obviously, no currency manipulation, very, very little government subsidies, so that reaching a deal with the Indians is much easier,” Bessant said, quoted by the New York Post.The comments were made on the sidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund’s annual meetings in Washington DC, where trade tensions and global economic shifts have been key topics.President Trump has made it clear that he wants foreign governments to slash their tariff and non-tariff restrictions on American goods and help reduce the US trade deficit. India, the world’s most populous country, could be the first to secure a trade pact that meets those terms.The push for a deal comes as US Vice President JD Vance visited Jaipur on Tuesday, urging India to remove remaining non-tariff barriers, open its markets further, and step up imports of American energy and defence equipment. He called for stronger economic ties as part of a vision for a “prosperous and peaceful” 21st century between the two democracies.Trade figures reflect the growing importance of the relationship. The New York Post cited US census bureau data showing that India made up nearly 3 per cent of US imports as of February. In 2024, the US trade deficit with India stood at $45.7 billion, according to the office of the US trade representative.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent says talks with India are close to a breakthrough.

Tesla's profits plunged by 71% in Q1 2025.

The electric carmaker has seen its profits plunge by 71 percent in the first quarter of 2025, driven largely by a backlash against Musk’s political affiliations and controversial role in President Donald Trump’s administration.Sales of Tesla vehicles across Europe have dropped sharply, with a 45 percent decline in the EU and a staggering 62 percent fall in Germany alone, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA). Showrooms in Europe and the US have become targets for vandalism and boycott campaigns following Musk’s support for public sector cuts and far-right figures overseas. In Milan, protesters hung Musk in effigy, while in Berlin and London, demonstrators labelled Tesla vehicles as “Swasticars. ”Also read: 'Will spend less time at DOGE from May': Elon Musk to focus on Tesla as its profits plunge 71%

Despite these setbacks, Musk appears intent on shifting focus back to Tesla. During Tuesday’s earnings call, he announced plans to reduce his time working for the “Department of Government Efficiency” – a post he holds in Trump’s administration – to just one or two days per week starting in May. Tesla’s shares rose nearly five percent following the announcement.Musk rejected claims that political controversies were damaging the brand, instead blaming recent sales drops on production halts caused by upgrades to the Model Y.Analysts, however, are not convinced. JP Morgan described the situation as one of “unprecedented brand damage,” while Wedbush’s Dan Ives, a longstanding supporter of Tesla, called it a “full-blown crisis.”Also read: Tesla feels the heat: Elon Musk’s DOGE politics hits Tesla profits

Compounding Tesla’s woes is the rise of aggressive competition, particularly from Chinese automaker BYD, which is developing ultra-fast charging batteries. European manufacturers are also rolling out new models with advanced technology, further eating into Tesla’s market share. In the US, Tesla’s dominance has slipped, with its EV market share falling below 50 percent.Meanwhile, Tesla continues to pin its hopes on autonomous driving. Musk reaffirmed that its Robotaxi service would launch in Austin by June, despite Google’s Waymo already offering millions of driverless trips in several American cities. Musk insists that software updates will soon allow current Teslas to operate autonomously, although such promises have been made – and missed – before.Tesla’s valuation remains lofty, trading at over 100 times its projected earnings, making the company highly vulnerable to further setbacks.","Sales of Tesla vehicles across Europe have dropped sharply, with a 45 percent decline in the EU and a staggering 62 percent fall in Germany.

""The US has made an all-time peak,"" he said, likening it to the Japanese market in 1989.

But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

The company also withdrew its forecast for 2025 amid tariff uncertainty as auto sales fell due to the launch of new vehicles.The company posted $471 million in profits for the quarter, a figure that exceeded analyst expectations but was just a third of its earnings over the same period last year, while revenues fell by five percent to $40.7 billion.It reported a 7% drop in wholesale units, a decline it had flagged earlier, blaming slower production at its Kentucky and Michigan plants where new vehicle launches are underway.Ford is now estimating a $1.5 billion annual hit to adjusted operating earnings due to tariffs, which have hit a lot of companies and productions since Trump returned to the White House in January. These include levies on imported vehicles, steel, aluminium, and auto parts.Despite efforts to cushion the blow, including shifting vehicle shipments from Mexico to Canada and avoiding duties on parts that only transit through the US, the company expected the total impact of tariffs to reach $2.5 billion. Supply chain tweaks have helped shave $1 billion off that figure so far.“Our teams have done a lot to minimize the impact of tariffs on our business,” said chief financial officer Sherry House, as quoted by AFP.Ford’s “Pro” division, which targets fleet and commercial buyers, and its “Blue” division, covering traditional petrol and diesel models, both saw profits slide. However, losses narrowed in the electric vehicle segment.Chief executive Jim Farley said Ford was staying “very aggressive” in the market, extending an employee-pricing promotion to drive retail sales. The company reported a lift in April sales thanks to the campaign but warned that prices could start climbing later this year as tariff costs filter through to consumers.House acknowledged the possibility of a “potential compression” in sales during the second half of 2025. Overall, the carmaker now anticipates full-year sales to remain flat or rise by only around one percent.The US auto giant described its underlying business “strong,” claiming that it had aligned with the prior projection of falling in the range of $7 to $8.5 billion in adjusted operating earnings, apart from tariff related impacts.Adding to the challenges are concerns over changes to US emissions policies and restrictions by China on rare earth elements, which are essential for auto manufacturing. Chief operating officer Kumar Galhotra said that such moves could disrupt production for Ford or its competitors, potentially altering pricing strategies across the sector.Ford shares dropped 2.3% in after-hours trading following the announcement.",Ford posts 65% fall in first quarter profits to $471 million.

UBS has a ‘neutral’ rating on SBI with the target price at Rs 840. Analysts said the bank’s management has cut loan growth guidance and they feel net interest margin to be under pressure in the near term. However, UBS has kept its EPS estimates largely unchanged for FY26 and FY27.CLSA has downgraded Kotak Mahindra Bank to ‘hold’ from ‘outperform’ but raised the target price to Rs 2,225 from Rs 2,125. Analysts said the bank had a mixed set of numbers in the Jan-March quarter. It missed CLSA’s pre-provision operating profit estimate, driven by lower net interest income and higher opex. They also said credit costs were higher as the bank strengthened its provision coverage ratio while loan growth moderated to low-teens.Jefferies has maintained its ‘hold’ rating on Avenue Supermart (D-Mart) with the target price cut to Rs 4,100 from Rs 4,225 earlier. Analysts said D-Mart’s margin slippage came as a big negative surprise, with the management attributing the same to high competition.Prabhudas Lilladher has given a ‘reduce’ rating on Indian Oil Corp with the target price at Rs 122. Analysts said although a strong gross refining margin (GRM) during the Jan-March quarter drove its earnings, the average Singapore GRM continues to remain weak at $3/barrel and the company is likely to report inventory losses amid sharp decline in Brent prices.Petchem weakness is also likely to persist and the company has indicated an under-recovery of Rs170/cylinder in April-June quarter on LPG.InCred Equities has retained its ‘reduce’ rating on JSW Steel with the target price at Rs 766. Analysts said the Supreme Court’s ruling last week ordering the liquidation of BhushanPower & Steel (BPSL) has cast a shadow of uncertainty on the steel maker. They said JSW Steel’s earnings projections for FY26–27 appear to be overly optimistic. The stock is trading at an unrealistic valuation (trading at a near 18-year high on EV/EBITDA basis).",CLSA has downgraded Kotak Mahindra Bank to ‘hold’ from ‘outperform’ UBS has a ‘neutral’ rating on SBI with the target price at Rs 840.

When they invest in stock markets, our companies do well. When the retail participation is larger, the stock market is also able to offset international flows.

Finding beauty in small packs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/finding-beauty-in-small-packs/articleshow/120914024.cms,"MUMBAI: Small packs or 'minis' are slowly making a big impact on Indian beauty market - consumers want to experiment and expand their basket of make-up products beyond a lipstick and a kajal at a 'right' price.The mass affordability of small packs aside, in a market like India where the challenge for companies is to get more women to use make-up beyond weddings and festivities, they also offer them the flexibility to try new products and make it easy for on-the-go consumption, said Sunanda Khaitan, VP at Lakme, adding that all big brands will increasingly bet on minis.""India is going to get into make-up in minis and India will buy minis in the same experience as the big product. Minis will become big with the Gen Z as well as they experiment a lot,"" Khaitan told TOI in an exclusive interview.The penetration of make-up in India is under 30% and there's enough room to grow - the rise of new channels like quick commerce is only helping expand adoption of make-up. People today are stocking up on items like nail remover and kajal through apps like Swiggy and Zepto, said Khaitan.Maybe there's the lipstick index at play but even though inflation has dampened broader discretionary spending, the beauty segment has not seen a very big impact.""Aspiration and beauty expression have not seen a slowdown. It has become stronger post-Covid but we have to be at the right place and at the right price. People have bought our lipstick costing Rs 1,100 through quick commerce and that left me amazed. I would agree with the lipstick index,"" said Khaitan.Competition has grown in India where a plethora of new age brands and international players have entered the beauty space, resulting in some impact on market share of big brands but the bigger challenge for firms is to stay relevant. For Lakme, the strategy will be to democratise make-up and bring latest trends to India at a price people can pay. The brand from the stable of HUL is also investing heavily on digital because that is where consumers are.","The penetration of make-up in India is under 30% and there's enough room to grow.

Prolonged tension to hurt Pakistan's economy: Moody's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/prolonged-tension-to-hurt-pak-eco-moodys/articleshow/120913871.cms,"NEW DELHI: A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability, Moody's Rating warned on Monday. In contrast, it does not expect a significant impact on India, apart from higher defence spending weighing on govt's fiscal consolidation plan.Pakistan was on the brink of bankruptcy until the International Monetary Fund bailed it out once again, provided it met several conditions. Its credit rating, Caa2+ according to Moody's, is speculative grade, signalling its weak fundamentals.""Pakistan's macroeconomic conditions have been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflation declining and foreign-exchange reserves increasing, amid continued progress in the IMF programme. A persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan's access to external financing and pressure its foreign-exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years,"" Moody's said.Apart from assistance from multilateral agencies, including IMF and the World Bank, Pakistan had also managed to roll over debt from Saudi Arabia, China and UAE to tide over the foreign exchange and debt crisis.The weak sentiments are also reflected in stock market indices. Pakistan's benchmark KSE-100 index fell another 635 points on May 5. Since April 23, the index has lost over 7,500 points, or 6% due to fears of a conflict.Indian markets have, however, held up. ""Comparatively, the macroeconomic conditions in India would be stable, bolstered by moderating but still high levels of growth, amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption. In a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India's economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan (less than 0.5% of India's total exports in 2024),"" Moody's said.Moody's is not budgeting for a broad-based military conflict. ""Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses. We assume that flare-ups will occur periodically... but that they will not lead to an outright military conflict.""","A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability.

The shoe company Skechers is being acquired for more than $9 billion to be taken private by the investment firm by 3G Capital The deal comes amid growing uncertainty over how US President Donald Trump's tariffs on foreign goods will affect companies who make their products overseas, particularly in China. Athletic shoe makers have invested heavily in production in Asia.The offer of $63 per share represents a premium of 30% to Skechers' 15-day volume-weighted average stock price, and it was unanimously approved the deal.Skechers shares jumped nearly 25% Monday, to $61.59.In a press release announcing the deal, the companies did not mention the potential impacts of Trump's tariffs on its business going forward. However, Skechers says that about two-thirds of its revenue comes from sales outside of the US China accounts for 15% of the company's revenue, according to the data firm FactSet.The deal comes at a precarious time with Trump's ongoing, on-again-off-again tariff announcements. Like many other companies increasingly have done since Trump's widespread tariff announcements, Skechers did not issue guidance when it released its first quarter earnings in April. Chief Financial Officer John Vandemore told investors that the ""current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success.Executives also said they would be looking to minimize products going to the US from ""high-cost locations,"" including the impact of tariffs. The company did not immediately provide a breakdown of foreign production, but many of their shoes come with a ""Made in China"" stamp.Trump raised the tariff on Chinese imports to 125% in early April, hours after China boosted the duty on American goods to 84% in an escalating battle that threatens to disrupt trade between the world's two largest economies.Skechers executives said last month that the company had several ""levers"" it could pull to deal with tariffs, including cost sharing with vendors, sourcing optimization, and price adjustments.""We're looking at how we optimize the global cost of tariffs in all markets when we look to move production around,"" Vandemore said last month. ""Obviously, with an effective tariff rate at about 159%, products from China to the US are prohibitively expensive.""Skechers has about 5,300 retail stores worldwide, about 1,800 company-owned.About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the US are imported, predominantly from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for US companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs.When the deal closes, the company will be led by Skechers Chairman and CEO Robert Greenberg and his management team. Its headquarters will remain in Manhattan Beach, California, where it was founded more than three decades ago.Skechers reported a record $9 billion in revenue in 2024 with net earnings of $640 million.The deal with 3G Capital is expected to close in the third quarter this year.","Skechers shares jumped nearly 25% Monday, to $61.59.

Taiwan dollar posts sharpest surge since 1988 amid trade deal speculation with US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/taiwan-dollar-posts-sharpest-surge-since-1988-amid-trade-deal-speculation-with-us/articleshow/120904579.cms,"AI generated image, the picture may not represent Taiwan's actual currency

Taiwan’s dollar has surged the most since 1988 as traders speculate that authorities might allow the currency to appreciate to help reach a trade deal with the US. The local dollar rose as much as 5% on Monday.In an emergency press briefing late Monday, Taiwan’s central bank sought to quell speculation about the currency’s surge, saying that the wild two-day appreciation was partially attributable to market chatter and urged against irresponsible speculation, as reported by Bloomberg.It also reiterated that the US did not require the currency to appreciate. Taiwan’s office of trade negotiations also said that it had wrapped up a first round of tariff-reduction negotiations with the US and that the talks did not touch upon the issue of foreign exchange policy. US President Donald Trump has previously advocated a weaker US dollar to boost America’s competitiveness.Bloomberg reported that others pointed to US dollar hedging by Taiwan’s life insurance companies as also giving the local currency extra momentum. Separately, the markets regulator has asked some life insurance firms, among the biggest Asian holders of US debt, to discuss how the rapidly strengthening Taiwan dollar has impacted their operations, people familiar with the matter said.“Local exporters are panicking, and local lifers are under-hedged, while equity-related outflows have ceased,” said Ju Wang, head of Greater China foreign-exchange and rates at BNP Paribas SA in Hong Kong. “The central bank remains the only buyer but has not been aggressively supporting the market, fueling speculation that currency valuation is part of the trade talks.”Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. dropped 1.3% on concern the stronger currency will dent its export earnings. The volume of US dollar-Taiwan dollar trades in Taipei early Monday jumped to the most since the 2008 global financial crisis. Banks have been bombarded with customer inquiries over the surge, with Cathay United Bank Co. introducing virtual queues on its online app to “maintain system stability. ”Despite the currency’s gains, Taiwan’s monetary authority hadn’t been seen aggressively intervening in the market Monday to limit its strength, though it typically does so to smooth out volatility. The recent tolerance of the central bank “for Taiwan dollar appreciation likely reflects a broader policy recalibration,” Christopher Wong, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore, said before the central bank’s briefing. “A more market-determined TWD ahead of negotiations may also be helpful during trade talks.”Currencies have also rallied across Asia in recent weeks as the US dollar has faltered on concern US President Donald Trump’s tariff war will hurt the world’s largest economy. The Taiwan dollar appreciated to as strong as 29.59 to the US currency during the trading day. It was at 30.14 as of 9:24 a.m. in New York. It has advanced more than 10% over the past month.A large chunk of the insurers’ stockpile of US bonds — including corporate debt and Treasuries — is partially or completely unhedged, meaning they are more vulnerable to losses should the dollar weaken. The companies own about NT$575 billion of US Treasuries, according to the latest data from Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission.“The moves over the past two sessions were really unprecedented, and if you’re exposed to the dollar as a lifer with little to no hedging, it’d been a painful ride,” says Mingze Wu, currency trader at Stonex in Singapore. “Taiwan life insurers are among the biggest holders of US bonds in Asia, so it makes sense that they’d be on their toes right now.”Taiwan is on the US Treasury’s “monitoring list” for foreign-exchange practices, and a stronger local dollar may be seen as another olive branch in negotiations.",Taiwan’s dollar has surged the most since 1988 as traders speculate that authorities might allow the currency to appreciate to help reach a trade deal with the US.

Key areas of non-tariff focus:

Currency exchange rates

Agricultural barriers

Taxation systems

Product standards

Bureaucratic procedures

'Buy American'

The US administration’s April 2 tariff announcement (later paused for 90 days) is part of a broader strategy aimed at compelling foreign governments to reduce trade barriers to American goods. Moving beyond traditional tariffs, the policy targets non-tariff barriers such as agricultural regulations, taxation systems, currency practices, product standards, legal frameworks, and customs procedures.Countries have been given a three-month deadline to make concessions or face new tariffs ranging from 10 per cent to over 50 per cent. Tariffs on Chinese goods have already taken effect.However, many nations face major challenges in meeting US demands, particularly in lowering tariff rates and navigating ambiguous negotiation terms. Officials from several targeted countries have expressed uncertainty about the administration’s specific requirements.US Vice President JD Vance confirmed that India has agreed to begin trade talks, while other nations are still attempting to define the negotiation framework. Analysts, quoted by the Associated Press suggest the administration’s goals are multifaceted- seeking not only to raise revenue and revive US manufacturing but also to open foreign markets and reshape international tax and regulatory systems.US President Trump has accused countries like Germany, China, and Japan of ""global freeloading"" by allegedly devaluing their currencies to make exports cheaper. While the European Central Bank’s rate cuts may weaken the euro, the Bank of Japan’s cautious rate hikes are expected to strengthen the yen. The US dollar has already fallen from 160 to around 140 yen, and analyst Shrikant Kale predicts a further decline to 120 yen. US agricultural exports face resistance due to food safety and domestic protection concerns. Japan restricts US rice and potatoes, Europe bans hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken, and Korea maintains age-based restrictions on beef imports tied to past concerns around bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.US potato growers, for example, have long targeted Japan’s estimated $150 million market. Yet despite prolonged discussions, Japan has delayed progress, citing regulatory concerns. “It’s pure politics,” said National Potato Council CEO Kam Quarles. “If Japanese politicians see Trump’s tariffs as more painful than domestic pushback, a deal becomes more likely.”In Korea, lifting beef restrictions remains politically sensitive. “It’s still controversial due to the 2008 backlash. The government will be cautious,” said trade law expert Jaemin Lee.The Trump administration has criticised the widespread use of value-added tax (VAT) systems, arguing they disadvantage US exports. However, economists maintain that VAT is trade-neutral. Over 170 countries use VAT, in contrast to the US's fragmented sales tax model.A potential increase in tariffs could affect European nations, where Value Added Tax (VAT) rates exceed 20 per cent based on product categories, and impact other 170-plus nations employing similar taxation methods. The United States stands unique in its approach, eschewing VAT in favour of state-specific sales taxes.Nations are unlikely to alter their taxation frameworks to accommodate Trump's stance. The European Union has explicitly stated that VAT remains non-negotiable.Japan’s auto safety regulations and electric vehicle subsidy rules have been flagged as obstacles to US exports. Similar regulatory hurdles exist in Korea’s pharmaceutical and automotive sectors.Cumbersome import processes in countries like Japan and Korea hamper US exports of seafood, grains, and manufactured goods. Delays and red tape have become major trade friction points.At its core, the administration’s agenda seems to prioritize reducing trade deficits through boosting US exports and shifting manufacturing back home. Some analysts question whether non-tariff concerns are genuine policy targets or merely justifications for tariffs.","The US administration’s April 2 tariff announcement (later paused for 90 days) is part of a broader strategy aimed at compelling foreign governments to reduce trade barriers.

Warren Buffett to stay on as Berkshire chairman as Greg Abel prepares to become CEO in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffett-to-stay-on-as-berkshire-chairman-as-greg-abel-prepares-to-become-ceo-in-2026/articleshow/120899844.cms,"Warren Buffett (File photo)

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett will remain chairman of Berkshire Hathaway even after Vice Chairman Greg Abel assumes the role of CEO at the start of 2026.The board of directors at the cash-rich conglomerate voted Sunday to retain the 94-year-old as chairman, offering reassurance to investors concerned about Berkshire’s stability amid economic uncertainty, including tariff impacts, financial market volatility, and rising recession risks, as per news agency AP.The board also formally approved Abel, 62, as Buffett’s successor. Buffett made a surprise announcement Saturday that he would step down from the CEO position by year-end.Shares of Berkshire Hathaway dropped more than 2% ahead of Monday’s market open.Buffett, who took over a struggling Massachusetts textile firm six decades ago, transformed it into a sprawling conglomerate with holdings in companies like Dairy Queen, See’s Candies, BNSF Railway, and major insurance firms. Under his leadership, Berkshire Hathaway’s stock has outperformed the broader market, delivering an average annual return of 19.9% compared to the S&P 500’s 10.4%.The board’s decision to keep Buffett as chairman comes amid speculation that his son, Howard Buffett, might be tapped for that role. Warren Buffett has previously stated that he wants Howard to take over as chairman after his death.Greg Abel, currently a vice chairman, will officially become CEO as the company faces significant strategic questions.Buffett has openly criticized former President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs and acknowledged concerns about whether Berkshire can maintain its current structure without being pressured to break up.Another major issue is the company’s massive cash reserve, which now totals $348 billion.Buffett told attendees at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha that opportunities for investment are currently scarce—even in the company’s own stock—but said that won't always be the case. “The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine,” Buffett said. “I have no intention — zero — of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually.”Abel, a reserved Canadian known for his passion for hockey, has long overseen Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses but has not been responsible for investment decisions regarding the firm’s large cash pile.Buffett’s personal fortune, nearing $170 billion, will ultimately be handled by his three children, including Howard, who Buffett has indicated could take over as chairman. In June, Buffett named Howard and his siblings as managers of his trust after his death. Howard Buffett, 70, runs his own philanthropic foundation and has donated billions to causes such as food security and humanitarian aid, including support for coffee farmers in El Salvador and landmine removal in Ukraine.Buffett has already donated tens of billions, including over $40 billion to the Gates Foundation, created by Bill and Melinda French Gates.Tributes poured in over the weekend, honoring Buffett’s legendary investment acumen and leadership style.“There’s never been someone like Warren, and countless people, myself included, have been inspired by his wisdom,” Apple CEO Tim Cook posted on X. “It’s been one of the great privileges of my life to know him.”JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called Buffett a symbol of American capitalism at its best, noting, “everything that is good about American capitalism and America itself,” and praised his “integrity, optimism and common sense.”","The board of directors at the cash-rich conglomerate voted Sunday to retain the 94-year-old as chairman.

India Battle Ready, Pak In Huge Panic: IAF Chief Meets Modi, Discusses 'Operational' Details

Following the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 and the resulting spike in tensions between India and Pakistan, major international carriers such as Lufthansa and Air France have begun rerouting flights to avoid Pakistani airspace, according to flight tracking data observed on Monday.This comes after India closed its airspace to Pakistani carriers. Meanwhile, Pakistan also implemented restrictions on Indian operations, while continuing to allow international airlines access, albeit with additional controls on trade and special visa arrangements for Indian citizens.Lufthansa Group confirmed to Reuters that its flights would avoid Pakistani airspace indefinitely, citing longer journey times on routes to Asian destinations. Data from Flightradar24 indicated that Lufthansa’s Frankfurt-to-Delhi flight (LH760) required an additional hour of flight time on Sunday due to the revised routing. These changes not only affect airline operations by increasing fuel usage and flight durations but also result in lost overflight revenue for Pakistan, which typically earns hundreds of dollars per flight based on aircraft weight and distance covered.Additionally, flight tracking systems showed aircraft operated by British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines, and Emirates opting for more northerly paths, rerouting via Delhi and bypassing Pakistani territory after crossing the Arabian Sea. British Airways and Emirates have not yet commented publicly on the matter.Air France officially announced its suspension of overflight permissions across Pakistan for an indefinite period, citing rising regional instability. The carrier attributed this decision to the ""recent evolution of tensions"" between India and Pakistan.India-Pakistan relations have been tense since 26 people were killed in a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, marking the worst attack since Pulwama in 2019. Some measures taken by India against Pakistan include closing the Indian airspace and suspending the Indus water treaty and stopping all forms of trade.The central government implemented sweeping restrictions, prohibiting all imports from Pakistan, whether direct or through intermediary nations, along with postal services and parcel deliveries from the neighbouring country.The administration also restricted Pakistan-registered vessels from entering Indian ports and banned Indian ships from accessing Pakistani harbours, indicating a tougher position amidst worsening diplomatic relations.

Global share markets showed mixed results in light trading Monday, as oil prices dropped following the OPEC+ alliance's announcement to increase production. Several major markets, including those in Britain and much of Asia, were closed for holidays. US futures fell, with the S&P 500 down 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average off by 0.5%.In Europe, Germany's DAX added 0.4% to 23,181.61, while France's CAC 40 slipped 0.4% to 7,737.21.Oil prices dropped sharply. US benchmark crude lost as much as 4% early in the day, later recovering slightly to trade down $1.15, or 2%, at $57.14 per barrel. Brent crude , the global benchmark, dropped $1.14 to $60.15 per barrel.Over the weekend, OPEC+—a coalition of eight major oil-producing nations—announced it would boost output by 411,000 barrels per day starting June 1. The decision is attributed to “strong fundamentals,” according to the group, though analysts speculate it may also be aimed at currying favour with US President Donald Trump ahead of his planned visit to the Middle East later this month.“Washington wants cheap energy, and Gulf producers still lean on US security guarantees; the White House bears down, they listen,” said Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management. “In that sense the US president has become an unofficial swing vote inside OPEC+,” he added.Oil prices have declined nearly 20% over the past three months, reflecting growing concern about the global economic impact of Trump’s trade policies. The US president has repeatedly cited lower gas prices as a political achievement.US crude is now down about 17% for the year. AAA reports that gasoline averages $3.17 per gallon, compared to $3.66 a year ago. However, the price drop is pressuring producers, with many nearing unprofitable levels.Asian markets saw limited activity due to holiday closures. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1% to 8,157.80, while Taiwan’s Taiex slid 1.2%.Currency markets also saw some movement. The US dollar slipped to 144.15 Japanese yen from 144.71 yen, while the euro rose to $1.1329 from $1.1306.On Friday, Wall Street wrapped up its longest winning streak since 2004, with nine consecutive days of gains. Investors were buoyed by a better-than-expected April jobs report and renewed hopes that tensions between Washington and Beijing may ease.The S&P 500 jumped 1.5%, the Dow rose 1.4%, and the Nasdaq also added 1.5%. Despite recent gains, the S&P 500 remains down 3.3% year-to-date and is still 7.4% below its February peak.Technology stocks led the rally—Microsoft climbed 2.3% and Nvidia gained 2.5%.

He said the main goal with China was to reach a deal that is fair.Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump mentioned he did not plan to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, news agency Reuters reported. However, he confirmed that US officials were engaged in talks with their Chinese counterparts on a range of matters.When asked if any trade agreements would be announced this week, Trump said it could ""very well be,"" but did not give any details.""We’re negotiating with many countries, but at the end of this, I’ll set my own deals — because I set the deal, they don’t set the deal,"" Trump said aboard Air Force One, as per a report by Bloomberg. ""You keep asking the same question: ‘When will you agree?’ It’s up to me, it’s not up to them.""Since April 2, when Trump introduced a 10 per cent tariff on most countries and higher tariffs on others — which were temporarily paused for 90 days — his administration has been actively meeting with trading partners. He also imposed 25 per cent tariffs on items like autos, steel, and aluminum, along with similar rates for Canada and Mexico, and a 145 per cent tariff on China.Trump said he did not expect to reach a deal with some countries and might instead set a specific tariff for them in the next two to three weeks, the Reuters report said. ""At a certain point, I’ll be just setting a certain tariff number,"" Trump said Sunday. ""At some point in the next two weeks or three weeks, I’m going to be setting the deal.""It was unclear if he was referring to the reciprocal tariffs announced on April 2, which are expected to begin on July 8 after the 90-day pause.Trump repeated his view that China had taken advantage of the US for many years in trade. He said former President Richard Nixon's decision to open relations with China was ""the worst thing"" he ever did.In a separate interview with NBC News, Trump had said he had been ""very tough with China"" and had basically stopped trade between the two countries. He added that China now wanted an agreement.""We've gone cold turkey,"" he said. ""That means we're not losing a trillion dollars ... because we're not doing business with them right now. And they want to make a deal. They want to make a deal very badly. We'll see how that all turns out, but it's got to be a fair deal.""","US President Donald Trump on Sunday said the United States was in talks with several countries, including China, about trade deals.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Testify: Sam Bankman-Fried acknowledges 'mistakes' but testifies he did not defraud anyone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/sam-bankman-fried-acknowledges-mistakes-but-testifies-he-did-not-defraud-anyone/articleshow/104761929.cms,"<p>Sam Bankman-Fried (File Photo- Reuters)<br></p>

NEW YORK: Sam Bankman-Fried , testifying in his own defense at his fraud trial on Friday, acknowledged that a ""lot of people got hurt"" when the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he founded collapsed, but said he did not defraud anyone or take customer funds.Shortly after taking the witness stand in Manhattan federal court, Bankman-Fried said he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange. The biggest mistake, he said, was not implementing a dedicated risk management team.""We thought that we might be able to build the best product on the market,"" Bankman-Fried said. ""It turned out basically the opposite of that. A lot of people got hurt - customers, employees - and the company ended up in bankruptcy.""Prosecutors accuse Bankman-Fried of using FTX customer funds to prop up his crypto-focused hedge fund, Alameda Research, make speculative venture investments and donate more than $100 million to US political campaigns. He also faces charges of scheming to cheat Alameda's lenders and FTX investors.He has pleaded not guiltyBankman-Fried's trial, which began on October 3, is drawing to a close nearly a year after FTX collapsed amid a wave of customer withdrawals. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2022 and Bankman-Fried was indicted the following month.His testimony marked the first time the dozen jurors and five alternates have heard directly from the 31-year-old former billionaire after 12 trial days.Bankman-Fried, who was jailed in August after US District Judge Lewis Kaplan found he likely tampered with witnesses, wore a suit and spoke with two water bottles placed in front of him on the witness stand. The former mogul once known for wearing shorts and T-shirts and sporting an unkempt mop of curly locks cut his hair before his trial began.Responding to questions posed by his defense lawyer Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried spoke in calm, measured tones during the first portion of his testimony as he recounted founding Alameda in 2017, shortly after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, despite knowing little about crypto.But Bankman-Fried - who had studied physics and worked as a quantitative trader at Jane Street - said he saw opportunities for ""arbitrage"" in the market for digital assets. He said Alameda's first office was in a small Airbnb in Berkeley, California, before he later moved the firm to Hong Kong.""We wanted to be under the radar at that point in time,"" he said on the stand, adding he named the hedge fund after the California county where it was founded in part so competitors would not discover what they were doing.Jurors have heard from three of his closest confidantes at FTX and Alameda, all of whom have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. They testified earlier this month that they committed financial crimes at Bankman-Fried's behest.For criminal defendants, taking the stand is a risky proposition because it opens them up to potentially probing cross-examination by prosecutors.But given Bankman-Fried's penchant for risk, legal experts say he likely viewed taking the stand as his best shot to counter the allegations made by members of his inner circle, which were backed up by spreadsheets the three said demonstrated how customer funds were stolen and text messages in which they discussed FTX's shortfall of funds with Bankman-Fried.","Sam Bankman-Fried says he made ""a number of small mistakes and a number of larger mistakes"" while running the now-bankrupt exchange.

"Crypto isn’t dead, it’s evolving rapidly to create a new world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-isnt-dead-its-evolving-rapidly-to-create-a-new-world/articleshow/101324954.cms,"Regulatory landscape



There are few technologies as confusing to most people as crypto and blockchain. The tech and regulations underpinning it are evolving so rapidly, it is difficult for even technologists to often make sense of it.Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world, as opposed to today where data is stored only in one place or clustered in a few locations. This data is open, meaning it can be viewed and verified by anyone taking part in that particular system. What this means practically is that an individual can transfer crypto assets without the help of intermediaries, say, banks or government agencies, thereby ensuring privacy, speed and lower costs.The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , was created with anonymity in mind, it was a way for people to conduct financial transactions away from the prying eyes of governments. While it went on to become a speculative asset, today, crypto, and the underlying blockchain technology, has a far more ambitious goal – the transformation of the internet.CoinDCX CTO Vivek Gupta says this technology can help usher in Web 3. 0 – a decentralised form of the internet where users can actually monetise their time spent online. “Whatever Web3 use case you may be driving, the value that comes from it must be distributed, and you cannot distribute that without crypto. For something as simple as depositing money in a pool and getting a receipt token, that receipt token is a crypto. That’s the proof that I have deposited the money. Without crypto there is no Web3 use case,” he says.Decentralised finance (DeFi) is a huge part of what makes blockchain tech so disruptive. Imagine being able to lend your money to strangers on the internet and get paid an interest. Or imagine spending time on socialmedia platforms or playing video games and getting paid for your time spent by someone who needs data about you. Web3 makes this possible because the data isn’t controlled by any one company or country.Decentralised apps (dApps) are another Web3 feature. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralised servers, dApps operate on a peer-to-peer network and utilisethe consensus mechanism and transparency features of blockchain technology.“I see a big disruption coming, especially in the DeFi tokenisation space and the whole content creator economy,” says Ravi Chamria, co-founder & CEO of Zeeve, a blockchain automation platform.Ashish Singhal, co-founder & CEO of CoinSwitch, says the tech can revolutionise how we conduct business, store data, and even vote, since the tech allows people to verify data of any kind efficiently.Governments are worried about what crypto could mean for monetary policy, for their ability to regulate people’s lives. But disruption hardly ever requires consensus. If a new technology proves to be better than an old one, people will drift towards it.Central banks have recognised the importance of the technology and some are creating Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that are based on blockchain technology. “There’s a lot of activity happening in the regulated DeFi space. Looking at the future, we think guardrails are probably a good thing to have around these sorts of technologies,” says Andrew Vranjes, VP of sales at Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform.Cryptocurrencies too are rapidly changing. Where before the value of cryptocurrencies were based on what people were willing to pay for them, today there are crypto assets that are backed by real world assets like equity and real estate. Silvina Moschini’s Unicoin is one of them. “It is an assets backed, audited, SEC-compliant cryptocurrency,” she says.","Crypto assets and crypto currencies are based on blockchain tech, which is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores data on thousands of data servers around the world.

"US tightens crackdown on crypto with lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/us-tightens-crackdown-on-crypto-with-lawsuits-against-coinbase-binance/articleshow/100810119.cms,"BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN



NEW YORK: The top U.S. securities regulator sued cryptocurrency platform Coinbase on Tuesday, the second lawsuit in two days against a major crypto exchange, in a dramatic escalation of a crackdown on the industry and one that could dramatically transform a market that has largely operated outside regulation.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a ""web of deception"".If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC's jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.""The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC's increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,"" said Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.""If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.""In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase's parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.Paul Grewal, Coinbase's general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has ""demonstrated commitment to compliance.""Oanda senior market analyst Ed Moya said the SEC ""looks like it's playing Whac-A-Mole with crypto exchanges,"" and because most exchanges offer a range of tokens that operate on blockchain protocols targeted by regulators, ""it seems like this is just the beginning.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has been a paradoxical beneficiary of the crackdown.After an initial plunge to a nearly three-month low of $25,350 following the Binance suit, bitcoin rebounded by more than $2,000, exceeding the previous day's high. It was trading just below $27,000 at 0410 GMT.""The SEC is making life nearly impossible for several altcoins and that is actually driving some crypto traders back into bitcoin,"" explained Oanda's Moya.Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term ""security,"" yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.While a few crypto companies are licensed as alternative system trading systems, a type of trading platform used by brokers to trade listed securities, no crypto platform operates as a full-blown stock exchange. The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.""The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we're asking them to come into compliance,"" Gensler told CNBC.Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC's rules are ambiguous, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler's efforts to oversee the industry.""We're confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,"" she said.Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.Tuesday's SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to restrict U.S. customers from its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.Binance pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC's ""misguided and conscious refusal"" to provide clarity to the crypto industry.Customers pulled around $790 million from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US, Binance's U.S. affiliate. The holding company of Binance is based in the Cayman Islands.""It's important to note that recent regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that companies operating in the cryptocurrency industry are complying with securities laws and protecting investors - this will always be their goal,"" said Joshua Chu, group chief risk officer at blockchain technology firms XBE, Coinllectibles and Marvion.""These events will ultimately lead to a more stable and trustworthy industry, which could help to attract more institutional investors and mainstream adoption.""","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday took aim at Binance.

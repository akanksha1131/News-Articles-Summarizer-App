When interest is paid—and when it is not

Why many refunds are taking longer this year

1. Mismatch between taxpayer data and department records

2. Foreign income or high-value transactions

3. Inoperative PANs, pending scrutiny or incomplete verification

New CBDT powers aimed at speeding up corrections

What taxpayers can do when refunds remain stuck

ITR filing FY 2024-25: Many taxpayers who completed their income tax return (ITR) weeks or even months ago are still waiting for their refunds despite the September 16, 2025 filing deadline having passed long ago. With bank accounts being checked daily, the tax department says the delays are tied to closer scrutiny of questionable deduction claims.Launching a taxpayers’ lounge at the India International Trade Fair (IITF), Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Chairman Ravi Agrawal said the department has already contacted individuals who may have missed key disclosures, asking them to submit revised returns. According to PTI, he added, “Low-value refunds are being released. We have analysed and found that some wrong refunds or deductions were being claimed. So, this is a continuous process. We hope to release the remaining refunds by this month or by December.”Amid the delay, experts note that taxpayers whose refunds are held up for reasons not attributable to them are entitled to statutory interest on the unpaid amount under Section 244A of the Income Tax Act.Neeraj Agarwala, Partner at Nangia & Co LLP, told ET “Under Section 244A, the department pays simple interest at 0.5% per month (6% per annum) on delayed refunds.”For ITRs filed on or before September 16, 2025, interest is calculated from April 1 until the refund is issued. For belated filings, the interest clock starts from the date the return was furnished.Interest varies depending on the type of tax paid and the timeline of payment or filing. Below is a summarised version of the department’s computation rules:Interest applies only if the delay is not caused by the taxpayer. Providing incomplete information, responding late to notices or giving incorrect details can make the taxpayer ineligible. Refunds arising from excess self-assessment tax under Section 140A also do not attract interest, and refunds below Rs 100 do not qualify.CA Mohit Gupta, Partner at PNAM & Co LLP, says, “Interest under Section 244A is payable at 6% per annum and continues to accrue for as long as the refund remains unpaid, irrespective of whether the return is taken up for scrutiny.” He notes that scrutiny proceedings themselves do not interrupt interest unless the delay is directly linked to the taxpayer.Data from the Income Tax Department as of 10 November 2025 shows a 7% year-on-year rise in net direct tax collections, but refunds have fallen by 18%. Several technical and compliance-related issues are contributing to slower processing:Gupta explains that TDS/TCS credit mismatches remain the most common trigger for delays. Errors such as incorrect TAN details, wrong section codes, outdated challans, or mismatches between gross and net interest figures frequently require manual review. Even minor inconsistencies between filings and Form 26AS, the Annual Information Statement (AIS) or the new Tax Information Statement (TIS) can flag a case for additional verification.Larger refund claims or filings that include foreign income, capital gains or multiple income streams take longer to clear. Gupta says, “Cases involving foreign income frequently see additional delays due to non-reflection of foreign tax credits. Another major source of delay is inconsistencies between ITR disclosures and data appearing in AIS/TIS.” Issues in reporting interest, dividends, capital gains, mutual fund redemptions, property deals or high-value SFT-flagged items often trigger automated alerts. Foreign asset reporting under Schedule FA is another high-risk category.Refunds are also held up when bank accounts are not pre-validated, PAN is not linked to Aadhaar or earlier tax demands remain unresolved. Returns not e-verified within 30 days become invalid until verification is completed. Gupta notes that when PAN becomes inoperative under Rule 114AAA, it disrupts every stage of processing—from TDS credit mapping to bank validation—making refunds impossible until the PAN is restored.To accelerate error resolution, the CBDT issued Notification No. 155/2025 granting the CPC Commissioner concurrent authority to rectify apparent errors and issue revised demand orders directly. Agarwala says the upgrade will help close long-pending cases faster because CPC Bengaluru no longer needs to wait for higher-level officers to issue corrections.If errors remain unaddressed or earlier rectification requests have not been processed, taxpayers may file a fresh online rectification request under Section 154. Gupta points out that the Income Tax portal’s e-Nivaran module allows users to file detailed complaints, upload supporting material and monitor progress online.Where responses remain slow, escalation through CPGRAMS often prompts quicker action because grievances are reviewed at senior administrative levels. Taxpayers may also write to their jurisdictional Assessing Officer or request a personal hearing. In situations of prolonged inaction or unjustified delays, filing a writ petition before the High Court is an available legal remedy.Refund delays can be frustrating, but the law does provide compensation where taxpayers are not at fault. Understanding how interest is calculated, ensuring accurate disclosures and using grievance channels effectively can help shorten the wait and ensure that refunds–and any interest due-reach the taxpayer sooner.","Many taxpayers who completed their income tax return (ITR) weeks or even months ago are still waiting for their refunds.

Benchmark indices snapped its two weeks losing streak supported by record low India CPI data and as U.S. government shutdown came to an end. A majority for the ruling NDA party in the Bihar election further lifted sentiments. Nifty started the week on a positive note and rallied higher as the week progressed to form an intraweek high of 26010 on Thursday. Nifty traded with high volatility in last Friday’s session and closed the week at 25910.05 levels up by 1.64% on a weekly basis.Looking ahead, the bias stays positive. A sustained move above last month’s high of 26,100 could pave the way for a retest of the previous all-time high at 26,277 in this week.If Nifty fails to hold above 26,100, it may slip into a consolidation phase between 26,100 and 25,700 after its sharp 700-point rally over the past few sessions.Key short-term support lies at 25,500–25,300, where the 50-day EMA, a major previous breakout zone, and key retracement levels all converge.Bank Nifty had rallied over 600 points last week (+1.11%), closing at a new record high of 58,516.55 after hitting an all-time peak of 58,615.95, reflecting strong momentum across both PSU and private banks.Looking ahead, the index is expected to continue moving higher, with fresh all-time highs likely. The uptrend remains strong, supported by a consistent higher-high, higher-low pattern on the weekly chart.It is trading well above all major moving averages, with its support base steadily rising. Immediate support is seen near 57,600 — the earlier supply zone that has now turned supportive — followed by 57,200, which aligns with the lows of the past two weeks.On the upside, as the index heads into uncharted territory, the next resistance levels are at 59,300 and then 59,650, which matches the 61.8% Fibonacci extension of the previous weekly swing.While stochastic indicators suggest overbought conditions, any dips can still be used as buying opportunities.Fortis Healthcare is a leading integrated healthcare service provider in India. The healthcare verticals of the company primarily comprise hospitals, diagnostics and day care specialty facilities. Currently, the company operates its healthcare delivery services in India, Nepal, Dubai and Sri Lanka.The company controls its diagnostics business through its 57% owned subsidiary SRL Limited. It is amongst the largest private diagnostics chains. It has a presence in over 600 cities and towns, with an established strength of 415 laboratories, 8,200 direct clients and 1,400 collection centers.The company is entering a multi-year earnings upcycle supported by (1) the largest bed expansion program in its history, (2) rising ARPOB and occupancy levels driven by a richer case mix, (3) accelerating O&M-led network scaling without incremental capital, (4) diagnostics margin recovery toward industry standards (28%) , (5) Removal of key regulatory overhung following SEBI’s approval of the IHH open offer, and (6) a clear pathway to becoming net debt free by FY28.Valuation: We value Fortis Healthcare on FY28E EV/EBITDA multiple of 26x, with a target price of Rs. 1,051 given its transition into a structurally stronger, higher-growth driven quality-oriented hospital platform.The stock is forming a base and consolidating on the daily chart. It is trading near its key moving averages and has retested the breakout from its falling trendline resistance level.After a brief pullback, it has regained strength and closed above the previous day, indicating continued upside potential. The risk–reward setup looks positive, and the RSI moving above 50 further supports the bullish view.We expect the stock to move toward 340 in the near term, which aligns with the previous swing high.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stock picks for November 21, 2025 are Fortis Healthcare, and Jio Financial Services.

Small shareholders get priority allocation

Buyback track record and promoter stance

Infosys share buyback: IT major Infosys is set to launch its largest-ever share buyback programme worth Rs 18,000 crore on Thursday, offering shareholders a tender window until November 26. The initiative will see the IT major repurchase up to 10 crore fully paid-up equity shares of face value Rs 5 each at Rs 1,800 per share, representing as much as 2.41 per cent of its total paid-up equity capital.Announcing the details in a regulatory filing, the company said the buyback window will remain open from November 20 to November 26, 2025, PTI reported. It added that the move follows an assessment of medium-term strategic and operational cash needs while ensuring surplus funds are returned “in an effective and efficient manner in line with its capital allocation policy”.Infosys has split the buyback into a reserved category for small shareholders and a general category. Small shareholders—defined as those holding equity worth not more than Rs 2,00,000 on the record date—will receive a 15 per cent reservation or their entitlement, whichever is higher. As of the record date on November 14, 2025, there are 25,85,684 shareholders who meet this criterion.The entitlement ratio has been fixed at 2:11 for the reserved category and 17:706 for the general category.Entitlement reflects the number of shares that eligible investors can tender based on their holdings as on the record date.This marks Infosys’ fifth major share repurchase since 2017. Its first buyback, conducted eight years ago, amounted to around Rs 13,000 crore with 11.3 crore shares purchased at Rs 1,150 each, equal to 4.92 per cent of the equity base. Subsequent buybacks were valued at Rs 8,260 crore (2019), Rs 9,200 crore, and Rs 9,300 crore in 2022–23.Promoters —including Nandan M Nilekani and Sudha Murty—have chosen not to participate in this round. Together, they hold 13.05 per cent of the company’s equity as on the announcement date.Infosys said it plans to “steadily increase its annual dividend per share” and continue returning approximately 85 per cent of cumulative free cash flow over a five-year period starting FY25, using semi-annual dividends, buybacks or special dividends, subject to approvals.","IT major Infosys is set to launch its largest-ever share buyback programme worth Rs 18,000 crore on Thursday.

Trump’s tariff impact!

'Love Us Again': Donald Trump Offers Fair Trade Deal, Promises To Reduce India Tariffs After Tension

The US trade deficit narrowed by about 24 per cent in August as sweeping tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump reduced imports, according to a delayed Commerce Department report released Wednesday.According to Associated Press, citing the report, the trade gap fell to $59.6 billion in August from $78.2 billion in July. Imports declined 5 per cent to $340.4 billion as businesses slowed purchases from abroad after stockpiling goods ahead of tariffs that took effect on August 7. Exports rose 0.1 per cent to $280.8 billion.Trump has upended decades of US free-trade policy by levying broad duties on most trading partners as well as on products such as steel, copper and automobiles. He argues that chronic trade deficits reflect foreign nations exploiting the US. Economists say tariffs are contributing to inflation by raising costs that importers largely pass to consumers.Despite August’s pullback, the trade deficit has widened in 2025, reaching $713.6 billion through August — up 25 per cent from $571.1 billion in the same period last year.A narrower trade gap typically supports economic growth because imports subtract from gross domestic product.“August’s smaller trade deficit will be a tailwind for third-quarter real GDP, since it means more US spending went to domestically-produced goods and services,” said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. The release was delayed due to the government shutdown.Public anger over living costs contributed to Democratic gains in the November 4 elections. Days later, Trump rolled back tariffs on items such as beef, coffee, tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes and some fertilisers, acknowledging their effect on prices.The Supreme Court is weighing the legality of the tariffs. During a November 5 hearing, justices questioned whether a president can impose open-ended duties under emergency powers without approval from Congress.","The US trade deficit narrowed by about 24 per cent in August as sweeping tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump reduced imports.

Asian equities slumped on Friday as renewed fears around overstretched tech valuations and ambiguous US jobs data pulled investors sharply away from risk assets.The downturn came despite Nvidia’s blockbuster earnings earlier in the week, which had briefly revived confidence in the strength of the AI sector.According to news agency AFP, concerns over an AI-driven market bubble resurfaced quickly, with tech majors across Asia leading the sell-off.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attempted to calm nerves, insisting during the company’s latest update that, “From our vantage point, we see something very different,” but the reassurance offered only temporary relief.Markets across Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul, Sydney and Taipei tumbled between 1.6% and 3.2%, as per AFP, with chipmakers absorbing the worst damage.Samsung Electronics plunged nearly five per cent, SK hynix more than nine per cent, and Taiwan’s TSMC slid almost four per cent. SoftBank also crashed over 10% in Tokyo.The shift in sentiment followed a sharp reversal on Wall Street. While US equities initially rose on Nvidia’s results, the rally collapsed after fresh labour data showed job gains in September but also a rise in the unemployment rate — a combination offering little clarity on the Fed’s near-term rate path.As per Reuters, futures now imply a 40% probability of a December rate cut.US futures now imply a 40% chance of a December cut, compared with 30% a day earlier.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan sank 1.8%, taking weekly losses to 3% — the steepest drop since April.Analysts said the market’s fragility was clear, with investors dumping positions even in response to neutral or mildly positive news.Currencies also reacted sharply.

JAL’s portfolio spans cement, power, real estate, hotels, and E&C projects, all of which offer synergies with the group.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on HDFC Bank with the target price at Rs 1,225. Analysts said the bank’s loan growth will broadly be in line with the system and it expects net interest margin (NIM) to stabilise and improve in the current half of the fiscal. They also said the lender’s collection efficiency and delinquency levels remain benign across segments.UBS has a buy on Reliance Industries with the target price at Rs 1,820. Analysts said that the company’s strength in refining would drive improvement in O2C earnings. They also said that the Singapore benchmark did not reflect current margins of diesel-heavy refiners. RIL’s diversified crude sourcing limits impact amid geopolitical dynamics.Macquarie has upgraded Hero Motocorp to outperform with the target price at Rs 6,793. Analysts said that the company’s domestic market share has stabilised, and they see upside risk in both motorcycles and scooters, led by GST reduction and product launches. They also said that electric two-wheeler traction is improving. They also see resilient margins notwithstanding ramp-up in 2Ws as ICE margins continue to surprise positively. They also see the market’s willingness to assign a higher multiple to the stock.ICICI Securities has a hold rating on NSDL with the target price at Rs 1,170. Analysts said the depository is a steady play on India’s capital-market growth with 42% recurring and 58% transaction-linked revenue. The company operates in a duopoly and has a capital-light model with strong return on equity (ROE). The stock is valued at 40x FY28 estimated earnings per share (EPS), in line with the target multiple of CDSL, its only peer in the market. The high valuation reflects long-term compounding potential and market-share gains. NSDL’s new management and digital initiatives are seen as positives while market momentum remains the key swing factor.","Jefferies has a buy rating on Adani Enterprises with the target price at Rs 2,940.

BENAGALURU: As TCS begins executing its multi-billion-dollar AI data centre blueprint, the company is positioning HyperVault at the heart of its ambition to become the largest AI-led technology services provider. In an interview to TOI, TCS CEO K Krithivasan and its chief strategy officer Mangesh Sathe outline India's rising digital footprint makes AI compute capacity a critical sovereign opportunity. Excerpts:K Krithivasan: The sovereign data centre for TCS is only one part of the strategy. If you remember, when we articulated our mission to be the world's largest AI-led services company, it was based on the fact that we've been working a lot with our existing customers for whom we are the preferred AI service provider, and we've been engaged with them in a wide set of activities. Based on that, we realised that we should aspire to be the world's largest AI services company. With this, we can offer data centres to hyperscalers; to some we can offer secure cloud, model-as-a-service, sovereign cloud, build applications, run them, and for pure AI players we can offer a place for model training and inferencing. It opens a huge set of opportunities for our customers. Unlike a pure data centre player, they don't have the adjacency - for us it opens many opportunities to provide end-to-end solutions.This is not to be seen as a secure data centre alone; it is an important lever to enhance our participation in the entire data ecosystem. We are very convinced this will put us at the center of activities with hyperscalers and AI players.Mangesh Sathe: We're looking at an 18-month build-up. In 18 months, we will build out multiple campuses running at the same time. The demand for data centre is very strong - the installed capacity is currently 1.6 gigawatt, and by 2030 the India demand itself is 10-11 gigawatt. It's a steady-state business in terms of revenues. And there's also an upside in terms of how we play with the power revenue that we would get out of this business as well - with renewable energy in the mix and the cost of electricity, that becomes a strong second line of revenue as well.Krithivasan: If you look at the key Tata Group companies, Tata Communications is the largest on the communication side in India, and Tata Power brings in so much renewable energy capacity and they become key partners to the project. Also, Tata Projects is the largest construction company in India, and TCE brings in design and project management capability. So we see a huge amount of synergy from high-quality players. It brings us the ability to get all of them together and ensure the timely and quality build-out of these data centres. Because power and connectivity are very critical components, they will be working with us on an ongoing basis.Sathe: We're evaluating land parcels in Navi Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Chennai. We have a very healthy list of land parcels in the funnel. We are also engaging with state govts. In the next few weeks, you will start seeing further developments. All the key locations for data centres currently, and the additional locations for AI loads that come in, are part of this. I think now we have a pretty interesting funnel of locations which will start getting converted.","TCS is positioning HyperVault at the heart of its ambition to become the largest AI-led technology services provider.

TEL AVIV/ NEW DELHI: India and Israel on Thursday inked terms of reference (ToR) to formally launch negotiations for a free trade agreement, commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal said.The ToR, which will be the basis for talks, includes market access for goods by eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers, investment facilitation, simplification of customs procedures, increasing cooperation for innovation and technology transfer, and easing norms to promote trade in services.""Now we will soon finalise the dates for starting the negotiations for that... Given the complementarities and challenges faced by the two countries, this can be a good basis for bilateral trade relations and open new opportunities,"" the minister said. Goyal, who is leading a 60-member business delegation, also said that the Israel has conveyed that it will not seek market access in sensitive areas such as dairy, rice, wheat and sugar.India and Israel had earlier engaged in negotiating a similar agreement and eight rounds of talks were held. The fresh dialogue comes amid India's growing appetite for trade deals as it seeks to diversify its exports to de-risk the portfolio. Israel is seen as a crucial ally, given the strategic nature of the relationship, although trade has so far not been a major driver. While Israel does not have a large market, it is home to cutting edge technology and some of the Israeli companies can use India as a base for manufacturing for the Indian market and also for exports.Israel economy minister Nir Barkat said India is a great bet for investment. ""Make In India is one of the smartest concepts and is relevant for many Israeli companies,"" he said.

Khambata questions Tata Trusts for not countering ‘false coup narrative’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-was-false-coup-narrative-not-countered/articleshow/125471745.cms,"Tata Trusts trustee Darius Khambata, in a letter to five trustees including chairman Noel Tata, has expressed disappointment over the Trusts’ failure to correct what he described as a “doctored media narrative” suggesting a “coup or takeover” by some trustees in recent developments.“This is absurd. I had no such intention, and I believe neither did anyone else. Nothing we did even remotely suggests this,” Khambata, the former advocate general of Maharashtra, wrote in his note dated Nov 10. “What has been disappointing to me has been the failure of the Trusts to correct this fundamentally false narrative.”Khambata, referring to events of Sept 11, when a majority of trustees, including himself, did not support the reappointment of Trusts vice-chairman Vijay Singh to the Tata Sons board, said his decision was not driven by personal bias.“It was a difference of approach in an annual review concerning representation of the Trusts through its nominee directors on the Tata Sons board. That representation is a duty to the Trusts, not a prize. I was motivated by one factor and one factor alone—viz to have a more assertive voice on the board of Tata Sons to help espouse the cause of the Trusts against listing Tata Sons,” Khambata said.But he said he “regretted” the “unfair media coverage” and “the consequent pain Vijay had to bear.With the benefit of hindsight a greater attempt at forging a consensus should have been made by all.”He added that in the past, former Trusts chairman Ratan Tata had asked if he was willing to be nominated as a Trusts director on the Tata Sons board, but he had declined. At the Sept 11 meeting, Khambata and others proposed former trustee Mehli Mistry as Singh’s replacement, but Noel rejected the suggestion.“That I and the others should have been subjected to such a vilification campaign with respect to this matter, where we honestly spoke our minds is completely unwarranted and unfair,” he wrote.Referring to events following Ratan Tata’s death, the senior advocate also sought to dispel the “suggestion” that some trustees were trying “to wrest control.” He said, “After Ratan’s passing, I and others wanted Noel to lead us…but we had to work towards that and resist any deferral of that decision. Mehli proposed and I seconded Noel as chairman.” It has been reported that a fellow trustee wanted the chairman’s position to remain vacant rather than appoint Noel.Khambata also pointed out that he was not always in agreement with Mehli Mistry. He said he had disagreed with Mehli on granting the SP Group a fair exit from Tata Sons, which he believed was essential to the Trusts’ interests. He said Mehli later came around to his point of view and “agreed to the July resolution enunciating opposition to listing” and “at the same time declaring that Trusts should seek a settlement with the SP Group. ”The SP Group, chaired by Noel’s brother-in-law Shapoor Mistry, is the largest non-promoter shareholder of Tata Sons.Khambata’s two-page letter, reviewed by TOI, was sent a day before the Trusts inducted Noel’s son Neville as a trustee of the flagship foundation. Khambata had proposed Neville’s name at the Nov 11 meetings of Sir Dorabji Tata Trust (SDTT) and Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT). Neville was appointed at SDTT but was rejected for SRTT by another trustee.","Darius Khambata, in a letter to five trustees including chairman Noel Tata, has expressed disappointment over the Trusts’ failure to correct what he described as a “doctored media narrative” He said a majority of trustees, including himself, did not support the reappointment of Trusts vice-chairman Vijay Singh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125471763,imgsize-590559,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

NEW DELHI: RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said on Thursday that the central bank does not aim for any particular level for the rupee, and depreciation of rupee is driven purely by market demand, with recent depreciation linked to tariffs.""We do not target any level for the rupee,"" Malhotra said at an event at the Delhi School of Economics. ""Ultimately, it's a commodity...a financial instrument. If demand for the dollar rises, the rupee will depreciate. Recent movement is linked to trade expectations and muted capital flows, but we are quite confident a good trade deal will happen soon, and we have very good buffer of foreign exchange at $690 billion,"" he added.Malhotra also said RBI remained ""very cautious"" on cryptocurrencies because of its risks, while pushing for their own digital rupee (CBDC) for domestic and cross-border payments. ""We have a very sound digital payments system with UPI and NEFT. Our focus is on CBDC, which is a crypto backed by the central bank,"" he said, adding that govt and its working group will take the final call on the policy framework for crypto.He also responded to a question on Indian banking expansion to the international stage, saying that India did not have a ""target number of banks"" to become big, but rapid economic growth and rising bank balance sheets meant ""it is only a matter of time before several Indian banks enter the world's top 100"".The rupee has continued its slide since the US imposed a 100% tariff on many exports in Oct 2025, prompting risk-averse investors to cut exposure. The currency has lost 3.5-3.6% against the dollar since Aug and has traded near record lows around Rs 88.7/$ after intraday fall of up to 0.7%. A stronger dollar, firmer crude and broader Asian currency weakness have compounded the pressure. RBI has stepped in to prevent a steeper drop, keeping the rupee in a narrow band, but traders warn that a breach of Rs 89/$ could force more aggressive intervention.","RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said the central bank does not aim for any particular level for the rupee.

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am — classified as 'very poor' — despite the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-III being in effect across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).A thick layer of smog continued to blanket Delhi on Monday, showing little improvement from Sunday’s AQI of 385.Bawana recorded the highest pollution level at 427, falling under the ‘severe’ category, while NSIT Dwarka reported the lowest at 225, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Iconic areas like India Gate and Kartavya Path were shrouded in toxic smog, with AQI readings of 341 (‘very poor’). Other hotspots included Chandni Chowk (383), RK Puram (366), ITO (394), Punjabi Bagh (384), Patparganj (369), Pusa (365), and Dwarka Sector-8 (356).Meanwhile, Anand Vihar remained engulfed in a layer of toxic smog, with the CPCB reporting an AQI of 383, classified as ‘very poor’.The thick smog, along with deteriorating air quality, mercury continued to hover around the 9 Degree Celsius mark, with some areas recording even lower temperatures.As per CPCB classification, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor', and 401-500 'severe'.Following the deteriorating air quality in the national capital, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) III was implemented on November 11 across Delhi by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). The measures aim to control emissions through stricter restrictions on construction, vehicular movement and industrial operations.Under GRAP-III, restrictions include a ban on most non-essential construction, limits on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles, suspension of in-person classes for students up to Class 5 with a shift to online or hybrid learning, curbs on industries using non-clean fuels, and a ban on non-emergency diesel generators.Earlier, the Supreme Court directed the governments of Punjab and Haryana to file a status report on the measures taken to curb stubble burning, which contributes to the air pollution crisis in the Delhi-NCR region.A bench of Chief Justice of India BR Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran ordered, ""We direct the state of Punjab and Haryana to file a report on what steps are being taken to curb stubble burning.""Since Diwali, air quality in Delhi and the NCR has remained in the 'very poor' to 'severe' categories in several areas, despite Stage III of the GRAP being in effect.","The national capital woke up to dense smog on Monday, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 359 at 7 am.

Pakistan’s economic forecast: GDP could grow 5%-6.5%; IMF flags corruption risks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/pakistans-economic-forecast-gdp-could-grow-5-6-5-imf-flags-corruption-risks/articleshow/125468758.cms,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlighted persistent corruption challenges in Pakistan, warning that systemic weaknesses across state institutions could limit economic growth unless urgent reforms are undertaken, Dawn reported.The IMF’s Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) is a prerequisite for its executive board to approve a $1.2 billion disbursement, expected next month.The report, as cited by Dawn, estimates that Pakistan could see GDP growth rise by 5 to 6.5% over five years if a comprehensive governance reform package is implemented within three to six months. Among the recommendations is an end to preferential treatment for influential public sector entities in government contracts, alongside greater transparency in the operations of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).“A unifying theme is the emphasis on increasing transparency and accountability in policy formulation, implementation and monitoring,” the IMF assessment said. It added that reforms should also improve access to information and strengthen the ability of state and non-state actors to participate effectively in governance and economic decision-making.The report stresses that both the IMF and the Pakistani government agree reducing corruption vulnerabilities is essential for sustainable reform.Anti-corruption measures are most effective when combined with broader governance-strengthening initiatives, the GCDA notes.Dawn reported that indicators show weak control of corruption over time, affecting public spending, revenue collection, and confidence in the legal system. The GCDA highlights systemic governance gaps across several functions of the state, including budgeting, fiscal reporting, capital spending, procurement, and oversight of state-owned enterprises.The assessment also points to a complex and opaque tax system managed by authorities with limited capacity and oversight, undermining overall performance. Pakistan’s judicial sector, it says, is inefficient and constrained by outdated laws, preventing reliable enforcement of contracts and protection of property rights, while organisational complexity and concerns about personnel integrity further weaken the system.Regarding procurement, the IMF demands the removal of preferences for state-owned enterprises in all public contracts, the elimination of direct contracting provisions, and mandatory adoption of e-governance procurement across all state transactions within 12 months. The first annual SIFC report must be published immediately, detailing all facilitated investments, concessions granted, and the rationale behind them.The GCDA highlights the need for the SIFC to develop explicit protocols and strengthen transparency measures due to its broad authority. It also questions the circumstances of its creation, noting that while the SIFC was set up to accelerate investment and privatisation, the Board of Investment continues to operate alongside it.The IMF report connects corruption vulnerabilities directly to fiscal performance. Pakistan’s declining tax-to-GDP ratio, it says, results from the complex tax system, frequent rule changes, and low public trust. Government discretionary spending remains substantial, with major gaps between approved budgets and actual expenditures, and limited parliamentary oversight.Dawn reports that discretionary allocations often favour districts represented by government officials or senior bureaucrats, reflecting a system vulnerable to political influence and resulting in low returns on public investment.",IMF: Pakistan could see GDP growth rise by 5 to 6.5% over five years if a comprehensive governance reform package is implemented within three to six months.

Unemployment concerns



Wage growth steady but unlikely to sway Fed

Job market in 2025



Revisions show major overestimate



Next full jobs report pushed to December



The United States finally released its long-awaited September employment data after a seven-week delay caused by the federal government shutdown, showing that employers added 119,000 jobs, more than twice what economists had expected.Though the figure offered a bright headline after weeks of uncertainty, the underlying numbers painted an uneven picture of the job market.Revisions to earlier months caused immediate concern. The labour department reported that August had in fact recorded a loss of 4,000 jobs, a sharp reversal from the previously reported 22,000 gain.Combined revisions for July and August removed 33,000 jobs from earlier estimates.June had already shown job losses, marking the first time since the 2020 pandemic that two months in a row had turned negative.The release of the figures was closely watched by businesses, investors and the Federal Reserve, which had been without official labour data during the 43-day shutdown. The report arrives at a time when the economy is balancing the effects of high interest rates and uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump’s push for broad new taxes on imports from nearly every country.Much of the hiring in September came from a narrow base. Healthcare and social assistance roles accounted for more than 57,000 of the jobs added, while leisure and hospitality, particularly restaurants and bars, contributed about 37,000.Construction firms added 19,000 positions and retailers nearly 14,000. Meanwhile, manufacturers shed another 6,000 jobs, extending their losing streak to a fifth month, and the federal government cut 3,000 positions for the eighth month running.“We've got these strong headline numbers, but when you look underneath that you'll see that a lot of that is driven by healthcare,’’ Cory Stahle, senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab told AP.“At the end of the day, the question is: Can you support an economic expansion on the back of one industry? Anybody would have a hard time arguing everybody should become a nurse.’’The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% in September, up from 4.3% in August and the highest level since October 2021.The increase was partly due to 470,000 people entering the labour force, either taking jobs or beginning to look for work, and not all were absorbed immediately.Wage growth remained relatively subdued. Average hourly earnings rose by 0.2% from August and 3.8% over the past year, moving nearer to the 3.5% annual pace that the Federal Reserve views as consistent with its inflation goals.The broader jobs landscape in 2025 has been defined by a combination of weak hiring and limited layoffs. Many workers have remained secure in their roles, but jobseekers have faced tougher conditions, with recruitment hampered by high interest rates introduced to counter the inflation spike of 2021–2022 and uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariff proposals.In September, the Labour Department also reported that the economy created 911,000 fewer jobs than first estimated in the year through March.Employers added an average of just 71,000 jobs a month during that period instead of the 147,000 originally reported. Since March, monthly job gains have slowed further to an average of 59,000.The government confirmed that the October jobs report will not be published in full because shutdown disruptions prevented officials from calculating the unemployment rate. Partial October data will be released alongside the full November report on December 16.","US employers added 119,000 jobs in September, more than twice what economists had expected.

Nasdaq also rose to 23,134 up, 569 points or 2.5% at 8:30 PM IST. S&P500 also followed the suit, rising 126 points or 1.9%.The gains also came after Nvidia delivered another heavyweight profit update, calming concerns that enthusiasm around artificial intelligence might be fading. Walmart’s stronger-than-expected results also helped lift sentiment.Ahead of the opening bell, futures trading pointed clearly to a risk-on mood. S&P 500 futures gained 1.6%, while futures tied to the Dow advanced 1% and the Nasdaq added 2.1%. Nvidia shares rose 5.2% in pre-market activity after the chipmaker posted a summer profit that outpaced Wall Street expectations and released a revenue forecast that once again sailed past analysts’ estimates.The company’s ability to repeatedly exceed projections has strengthened its role at the heart of market volatility.Nvidia, now the most valuable firm on Wall Street and briefly worth more than $5 trillion, holds such a large weight in the S&P 500 that its daily swings can set the tone for the entire index. Recent doubts about whether AI-linked stocks had surged too far, too fast have rattled markets, but the latest earnings figures offered investors a renewed sense of assurance.Nvidia’s dominance has also made it a proxy for the wider AI build-out, with companies across industries relying on its chips to expand their artificial-intelligence capabilities.Markets also reacted to new figures on the U.S. labour market. Government data showed hiring in September was stronger than economists had projected, although the unemployment rate rose slightly. The mixed report kept hopes alive that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates again at its December meeting. The central bank has already trimmed rates twice this year as the job market has gradually slowed.However, some Fed officials have recently suggested that holding off next month may be prudent, warning that inflation’s persistence above the 2% target leaves little room for complacency. Lower rates can stimulate the economy and lift asset prices, but they also risk fuelling further inflation.Overseas markets largely mirrored the positive tone. Germany’s DAX rose 1.3%, London’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.7%, and France’s CAC 40 posted a 1.1% gain.

Huang’s three-part case for why AI demand is real



Earnings surge helps calm bubble fears — for now



Concentration risks and heavy customer capex still worry investors



Growth challenges ahead, despite strong demand

Bubble or not? Huang insists fundamentals are driving the boom

For months, investors have questioned whether the explosive spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure is pushing global markets toward an AI bubble.With billions being poured into data centres and GPU clusters, analysts have wondered if the returns will justify the scale of investment.However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang pushed back firmly against the speculation during the company’s latest earnings call.“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,” Huang told analysts, as quoted by CNBC. “From our vantage point, we see something very different”, he added.His remarks carry weight as Nvidia sits at the centre of the AI ecosystem, supplying GPUs to every major cloud provider — Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Oracle — and to leading AI labs including OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI and Meta.Huang said the industry is undergoing structural shifts that have little to do with hype. According to him, companies are moving away from traditional CPU-based systems, which can no longer keep up with the heavy computing demands of AI.He told analysts that data processing, search, advertising and engineering workloads are increasingly shifting to GPU-based infrastructure because they “need the AI,” as per CNBC.He added that AI is no longer just improving existing applications but is creating entirely new categories of software. Huang also pointed to the rise of “agentic AI” — systems capable of reasoning and operating with limited user input — which will require even greater computing power in the coming years.Nvidia, he said, is the only company positioned to power all three transitions.Nvidia’s numbers added fuel to Huang’s argument. The company reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations and forecast stronger-than-expected revenue for the next quarter, reported Reuters.Nvidia said data-centre revenue reached $51.2 billion in the quarter ended October 26, with overall sales rising 62% — the first acceleration in seven quarters.Huang reiterated that Nvidia has $500 billion worth of chip bookings through 2026, a figure he first shared last month.The company noted that a few recent deals, such as an agreement with Anthropic, were not yet included in the order backlog, indicating the figure could grow, as per CNBC.Shares jumped 5% in extended trading, positioning Nvidia to add $220 billion in market value, reported Reuters. The broader market, however, remains cautious.Some analysts cited by Reuters claimed that the strong results may still not silence bubble fears, with concerns that AI infrastructure spending is expanding faster than it can realistically be used.According to Reuters, Nvidia’s customer concentration has grown sharply, with four customers accounting for 61% of sales in the most recent quarter. Some analysts also pointed to what they call a “circular AI economy,” in which Nvidia invests billions in AI firms that later become major GPU buyers.Wall Street has also been uneasy about how heavily cloud giants are relying on debt to finance AI expansion. Huang brushed off these concerns, saying, “Our customers’ financing is up to them,” reported CNBC.Cloud providers including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta now expect to spend more than $380 billion this year on capital expenditure tied to AI buildouts, as per CNBC.Some investors fear the scale of this spending could repeat past boom-and-bust cycles.Huang avoided naming a single constraint to Nvidia’s growth when asked by analysts, instead highlighting the scale and “newness” of the AI transformation, reported Reuters.Analysts, however, point to external roadblocks. eMarketer’s Jacob Bourne told Reuters that physical constraints — such as power availability, land and grid capacity — could limit how quickly cloud providers can turn GPU demand into real revenue.Nvidia, largely restricted from selling advanced chips to China due to US export rules, is now looking to the Middle East as an emerging market. The US commerce department has authorised the export of up to 35,000 Nvidia Blackwell chips to two firms in Saudi Arabia and the UAE — a shipment worth more than $1 billion by market estimates.Despite the market’s skittishness, Huang stood by his view that AI spending reflects long-term demand rather than irrational exuberance. He urged investors to focus on the “fundamental dynamics” of computing’s shift to GPUs, the creation of new AI-native applications, and the rise of agentic systems.“Each will contribute to infrastructure growth in the coming years,” he told analysts.For now, Nvidia’s performance and guidance have bought the industry some breathing room.Whether they will be enough to silence talk of an AI bubble remains an open question — but Huang is adamant: from his vantage point, this is no bubble.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang insists fundamentals are driving the boom.

Washington signals slower approach to semiconductor duties



Trump, Xi Defuse Tariff Time Bomb? U.S. & China Edge Towards Ending Trade War | Global Pulse

White House denies policy shift



China urges cooperation, not confrontation



Political pressure over consumer prices rises



The Trump administration may postpone the rollout of long-promised semiconductor tariffs, despite earlier indications that the measures would be announced soon.According to news agency Reuters, US officials have privately told government and industry stakeholders over the past few days that the tariffs might not be imposed immediately, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the conversations.These discussions, which had not been previously reported, suggest a more cautious approach intended to avoid provoking China.Sources cited by Reuters claimed that Trump aides are carefully assessing the timing of the proposed duties to prevent a rupture with Beijing that could risk a renewed trade war or disrupt supplies of critical rare earth minerals.However, they also stressed that no final decision has been taken and warned that triple-digit tariffs could still be announced at any moment.The White House pushed back against suggestions that the administration has adjusted its stance. “The Trump Administration remains committed to using every lever of executive power to reshore the manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security,” spokesman Kush Desai said, as quoted by Reuters, calling anonymously sourced claims “Fake News.”A commerce department official also said that there had been “no change” in the department’s policy on semiconductor tariffs.Trump had announced in August that the US would impose a tariff of about 100% on imported semiconductors, while exempting firms manufacturing domestically or planning to do so.Officials had privately indicated for months that the rollout was imminent before the recent shift in tone.Responding to the reports, the Chinese embassy in Washington said cooperation was the best path forward.Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu was cited by Reuters as saying, “We welcome the US to work with China to… jointly maintain the stability of the global semiconductor supply chain.”The hesitation comes as Trump attempts to preserve a fragile trade truce with China. He recently met President Xi Jinping in Busan, where the two leaders agreed to set aside trade disputes for now.Still, US officials cautioned their Chinese counterparts that national security-related actions may follow in the coming months.Any delay in chip tariffs also reflects domestic political sensitivities. The Republican president is facing growing consumer frustration over rising prices during the holiday shopping season.Taxing imported semiconductors could make everyday electronics—from refrigerators to smartphones—more expensive.The administration is also evaluating a plan to tax foreign electronic devices based on the number of chips inside them.Trump recently rolled back tariffs on more than 200 food items, though he has insisted his import duties have not significantly fuelled inflation.Inflation, however, has remained above the Federal Reserve’s target since the Biden administration, with the latest data delayed by the US government shutdown.Washington has also launched investigations into pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports, arguing that heavy reliance on overseas production poses national security risks.","US officials have privately told government and industry stakeholders that the tariffs might not be imposed immediately, according to reports.

Trump's H-1B U-Turn: From 'America First' To ‘US Lacks Talent’ Shocker; MAGA Stunned

NEW DELHI: Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai has reaffirmed the vital role of immigrants in the growth of the United States technology sector, calling their contribution “phenomenal” at a time when the H-1B visa system is at the centre of renewed political debate.In an interview with the BBC, Pichai said, ""If you look at the history of technology development, the contribution of immigrants to the sector has been nothing but phenomenal."" He acknowledged the H-1B programme’s ""shortcomings"" but said the administration is working to resolve them. ""I think there's a framework by which we all can still bring talented individuals. I think they're making changes to address some of the shortcomings in the current programme,"" he added.Pichai, who first arrived in the US as an international student and later secured an H-1B visa before rising to lead Google and its parent company, has long been a vocal supporter of immigration.During the interview, he was also questioned about the growing influence of technology leaders. The reporter referred to a photograph of Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk in seats of honour at the president's inauguration and asked whether the proximity between political power and Big Tech made people uncomfortable.Pichai said, ""It is an extraordinary moment in terms of this AI technology. I think, you know, it has tremendous opportunities to deliver benefits to the economy. It matters from a national security standpoint in the US president Trump has been very clear in the importance of this technology and has articulated a clear AI action plan with multiple aspects to it to deliver benefits to the country and not just us, the leading companies which are building this technology. I think it's important we are engaging with the government in a way that this technology is going to translate to deliver benefits for society, including thinking through concerns around potential misuse of the technology.""He was later asked specifically about the White House's crackdown on foreign worker visas and how it might affect the sector, given his own journey on an H-1B visa. Pichai said, ""If you look at the history of technology development, the contribution of immigrants to the sector has been nothing but phenomenal. But I do think the government understands it. I think there's a framework by which we all can still bring talented individuals. I think they're making changes to address some of the shortcomings in the current program, and I think we'll be able to continue investing.""The debate around the visa programme intensified after President Donald Trump proposed a 100,000 dollar fee for new H-1B applications in September. The White House has said the goal is to curb misuse in the system, not eliminate it.Meanwhile, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has announced plans to introduce legislation to ""completely eliminate"" the H-1B programme and end its pathway to permanent residency. She said the change would ""force"" immigrants to ""return home"" after their visas expire. Her bill includes a single exemption that allows up to 10,000 visas a year for doctors, nurses and other medical professionals.If enacted, the proposal would heavily impact Indian professionals, who represent more than 70 per cent of approved H-1B petitions in recent years due to strong demand for skilled workers in STEM fields and better opportunities in the US.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai has reaffirmed the vital role of immigrants in the growth of the United States technology sector.

Asian markets jumped on Thursday as strong earnings from Nvidia lifted sentiment and eased fears of an AI-driven bubble, even as investors tempered expectations for a December rate cut following signals from the US Federal Reserve.According to news agency AFP, Nvidia’s quarterly results and upbeat comments from CEO Jensen Huang — who said “we see something very different” when asked about an AI bubble — helped soothe concerns over overstretched tech valuations.Shares of the chipmaker rose more than five percent in post-market trade, pushing S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures higher.The rally spilled over into Asia, where tech firms led gains. Samsung, SK hynix, TSMC and SoftBank all surged, while Tokyo’s Nikkei briefly jumped more than four percent.Markets in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Wellington and Jakarta were also higher.As per Reuters, MSCI’s Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index rebounded 0.6%, while Nvidia “delivered yet another master class in AI dominance,” according to IG analyst Tony Sycamore.Strong moves were seen across chip-related stocks, with Japan’s SoftBank soaring as much as 8% and Taiwan’s TSMC advancing more than 4%.The rally helped offset pressure from the Fed’s October meeting minutes, which showed officials leaning against a third consecutive rate cut next month, as per AFP.Traders, according to Reuters, sharply scaled back expectations for a December reduction to about 33%, after the US delayed its September jobs report and postponed the October data release until December 16.The shift pushed the dollar higher and it rose to 157.47 yen.Crude prices also edged up. Brent rose 0.33% to $63.72 a barrel and WTI gained 0.40% to $59.68 as markets assessed new US proposals to end the war in Ukraine and prepared for a November 21 deadline for companies to cease operations with Rosneft and Lukoil under Washington’s sanctions.The rebound followed nearly 2% losses a day earlier, with IG’s Sycamore saying crude retains a “bullish bias” above $55.","Shares of the chipmaker rose more than five percent in post-market trade, pushing S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures higher.

AI chip giant Nvidia on Wednesday reported profit of $31.9 billion and record high $57 billion quarterly revenue, surging beyond the bar set by stock market projections, potentially easing AI bubble fears.Investors closely watched as chipmaker Nvidia released its quarterly earnings amid the backdrop of AI bubble concerns.""Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,"" Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in an earnings release, referring to the latest model of its state-of-the-art hardware.The report, coming after the markets closed, is seen as a check on the AI boom that began three years ago with OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Economic landscape:

Political situations:

Renewed interest:

Fin-fluencer effect:

Other investments:

Pakistan’s stock market is experiencing an unusual surge, driven largely by retail investors, signalling renewed confidence in local equities after years of uncertainty.The KSE-100 Index has soared roughly 40% in 2025, making Pakistan one of Asia’s top-performing markets. With property prices stagnant and deposit rates halved over the past two years, more individuals are turning to shares as an alternative investment, Bloomberg reported.“We’re now seeing a liquidity-led rally,” said Mohammed Sohail, chief executive officer at Topline Securities Ltd. “Unless that liquidity finds a new avenue, the markets will likely stay strong.”The market’s momentum coincides with Pakistan’s improving economic landscape. After narrowly avoiding a debt default in 2023, the country received upgrades from S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings this year, reflecting better fiscal management and progress under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s IMF-backed reforms.Current political and strategic developments have also fueled this sentiment. The country's field marshal Asim Munir, widely regarded as Pakistan’s most powerful leader, has been credited with strengthening US relations.His elevation to a role extending until 2030 is seen as reinforcing stability.Investor participation is rising sharply. Nearly 36,000 new trading accounts were opened in the September quarter, up from 23,600 in the previous three months, according to Topline Securities. Trading activity has followed suit, with daily turnover surpassing $200 million in October—the highest since 2017, Bloomberg data show.Financial influencers online also play a role in fueling the interest. One such example is Jawad Khalid Mirza, a 44-year-old chief information security officer who once dismissed the market as gambling that ignored fundamentals. However, after following local “fin-fluencers” on Facebook, he invested in National Foods Ltd., a producer of ketchup and spices he personally uses.Mutual fund investments are also on the rise. By September, 16% of total assets managed by asset management companies were invested in equities, up from 9% at the start of the year, according to the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan.Stock market experts, have said that the steadiness will most probably continue for some more time. Mattias Martinsson, chief investment officer at Stockholm-based Tundra Fonder AB, told Bloomberg that ongoing crises have made companies more prudent in financial management, while the central bank has become more transparent.Nevertheless, inflation poses risks, with Bloomberg Economics predicting a further rise in prices after an unexpected acceleration in October. Geopolitical tensions with India and Afghanistan could also weigh on investor sentiment.Foreign investors are pulling back, selling a net $308 million in local shares in 2025, their largest annual outflow since 2018.Martinsson remains cautiously positive saying that in order to be optimistic from here on, ""you need to expect that the next 10 years for Pakistan will be better than the last ten.""The expert further added that even more gains could emerge on the way ahead, ""but they could be slower and steadier than what we saw in the last few years.""","Pakistan's stock market is experiencing an unusual surge, driven largely by retail investors.

Less inflow, more outflow?





Checks limited to tax filers and spouses with a $100,000 individual income cap could cost $279.8 billion – $121 billion above projected revenue.

Expanding payments to include non-filers, spouses, and dependents could push costs to $606.8 billion, nearly double the expected 2025–26 tariff revenue .

Congressional support....or maybe not?





Trump's promise may backfire





Legal obstacles





When, if at all, the rebate could arrive





US President Donald Trump has vowed a tariff rebate of $2,000 to Americans next year, offering a potential financial boost to millions facing high costs of living.“We’ve taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff money. We’re going to be issuing dividends…probably the middle of next year, a little bit later than that, of thousands of dollars for individuals of moderate income, middle income,” Trump announced earlier on Monday.Experts, however, beg to differ, as the promise still faces a long and thorny road ahead. Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, told CNN, “It’s highly unlikely there is some sort of stimulus check sent out next year. I would be pretty shocked.”Even prediction markets reflect scepticism: users on Polymarket assign just an 11% probability that a tariff dividend will arrive by March 31.While tariffs are generating revenue, the cost of rebate checks could exceed incoming funds. Trump’s new tariffs are expected to raise $158.4 billion in 2025 and $207.5 billion in 2026, according to the Tax Foundation.The foundation also modelled dividend scenarios:But the problem with these predictions is that the overall value in all these situations would still exceed the incoming money.Approval from Congress is another major barrier.Republican lawmakers concerned about deficits may resist allocating $300–600 billion in additional spending.The national debt, having surpassed $34 trillion in January 2024, now sits at $38 trillion, CNN reported.While the rebate could relieve financial strain for households, some economists warn it could worsen inflation. Additional consumer spending without a corresponding increase in supply can push prices higher.Stephen Moore, co-founder of Unleash Prosperity and former Trump economic adviser, said, “Sending out checks to people is a bad way to stimulate the economy. If there is tariff revenue, that should be used to cut income taxes across the board. Stimulus checks only stimulate inflation.”Using tariff revenue for dividend payments could also unsettle bond markets, raising Treasury yields and making loans and mortgages more expensive. Ed Mills, a Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, noted, “What Congress and Trump are trying to do with stimulus, the bond market could take away instantly.”Legal uncertainty adds another complication. During Supreme Court hearings this month, justices questioned the use of emergency powers to impose global tariffs. The Tax Foundation estimates that potentially invalid tariffs make up roughly 75% of the projected new revenue.“If the Supreme Court says the bulk of the tariffs are illegal, that could throw a wrench in the tariff rebate plan,” Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation told CNN.With all the above reasons, traders are not counting on the promise to materialise.For now, Wall Street investors remain cautious. Bob Elliott, CEO of alternative investment firm Unlimited, said, “We’ve learned that late night Truth Socials are not a direct line to reality.”One scenario in which the checks could become reality is an economic emergency. Rising unemployment or a weakened job market could force the White House to argue that direct payments are necessary to prevent a recession.“It’s almost like we shouldn’t want stimulus checks to happen,” Mills said. “Because it would be an indicator of something wrong. This is a break-the-glass, use in case of emergency tool.”","US President Donald Trump has vowed a tariff rebate of $2,000 to Americans next year.

The Baby shark effect

Growing pains and legal battles

More than Baby Shark?

can it avoid being seen as a one-hit wonder?

What the company plans next

Can a simple children’s song really grow into a company valued at more than $100 million? Well that’s exactly what happened with South Korea’s Pinkfong!But how did a tiny digital-content start-up with only three employees turn into a company worth hundreds of millions in under a decade?Well the story starts long back with a tiny Seoul office where three people worked without knowing whether they would even get paid. One of them, Kim Min-seok, now looks back at that early setup and laughs at how small the room was. “The office was tiny – even smaller than this,” he said, explaining to the BBC team that they “didn't even expect a salary at the time”.Now, more than a decade later, the same company has listed its shares on South Korea’s stock market.On Tuesday, its debut saw the stock climb over 9%, pushing Pinkfong’s value past $400m (£304m). It is a remarkable jump for a business that originally made digital content simply to entertain children up to the age of 12.The turning point came from something Kim approved without much thought: a 90-second video uploaded in June 2016. That video was Baby Shark, the children’s song now watched more than 16 billion times on YouTube, giving it the title of the platform’s most viewed video ever.“We didn’t expect it to stand out from our other content,” he told the BBC from Pinkfong’s headquarters.“But looking back, it became a major turning point that set the stage for our global journey.”While the viral version belongs to Pinkfong, the tune itself is believed to date back to US summer camps in the 1970s. Media analyst Kevin Chew describes the modern recording’s repetitive line, “Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,” as something “attractive for children, though possibly annoying for adults”.Kim agrees the tune has a strange power. “It's like a K-pop song. It's very fast-paced, rhythmical and it's addictive,” he said. He believes the melody’s “chanting” feel makes it easy for young children to remember.The Baby Shark clip did not go viral immediately. Its rise began only after the dance routine was picked up at kids’ events in South East Asia. Once videos of children and adults dancing started circulating online, views climbed rapidly. Kim remembers the mood in the office changing overnight: “festival-like,” he said, as they watched the numbers jump in real time.By November 2020, it became the most viewed video on YouTube, and for several years it brought in around half of Pinkfong’s total revenue. The company soon expanded its characters, merchandise and content catalogue.Success also came with challenges. In 2019, an American composer accused Pinkfong of plagiarism. The company argued its version was based on a public-domain folk song. South Korea’s Supreme Court eventually rejected the claim, a decision Kim described as uplifting, though Pinkfong had filed its stock listing application before the verdict.Now, Pinkfong has grown far beyond its early three-person team. It now has around 340 employees and offices in Tokyo, Shanghai and Los Angeles. The firm rebranded itself in 2022 as The Pinkfong Company, taking the name from the cheerful pink fox character that first appeared in its early content.Yet the company now faces a question many investors are asking:Korea University’s Min Jung Kim says its main advantage is its target audience, toddlers, who tend to watch the same content repeatedly. Still, she believes the company must prove that other characters can match Baby Shark’s reach.Baby Shark currently accounts for about a quarter of Pinkfong’s revenue, while another franchise, Bebefinn, now makes up roughly 40%.Parents’ reactions vary too. Saleem Nashef, a father of two told the BBC that he appreciates the learning elements in Pinkfong videos, though his wife thinks Baby Shark is “too over-stimulating for kids”. Their daughter, nearly three, remains a fan regardless, her upcoming birthday will be Baby Shark-themed.Pinkfong raised almost $52m from its stock market debut. Kim said the company will use the funds to expand its characters and films, with a goal of becoming a “tech-driven” creator using viewing data to shape its projects.For now, Kim insists the company’s future will not be limited by its biggest hit. Pinkfong, he said, has already achieved “what many creators have always dreamed of”. The next chapter is proving that lightning can strike again.","South Korea's Pinkfong is valued at more than $100m (£304m) The company started out with just three employees in a tiny Seoul office.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024. With generative AI (GenAI) acceleration, 70 per cent of start-up founders are embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in their solutions.As funding becomes scarce for the Indian startup ecosystem in general, the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given a new lease of life to entrepreneurs and founders in the country, as the Centre extends support to the sector.","The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode.

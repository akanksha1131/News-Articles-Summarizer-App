Stock market recommendations:Swiggy is benefitting from easing competition in quick commerce (QC), with slower dark store expansion. With discounting intensity easing and sharper cost discipline, unit economics are improving, supporting a faster path to Instamart profitability. Food delivery (FD) growth, previously impacted by weak sentiment, is set to accelerate.GST-led boost to disposable income & rising discretionary spending should drive higher order volumes and platform engagement.

With stronger QC margins and improved profitability, we upgrade Swiggy to BUY with a revised TP of INR560.Phoenix Mills has expanded aggressively with new malls across Lucknow, Indore, Ahmedabad, Pune, & Bengaluru, along with acquisitions like ISMDPL (Island Star Mall Developers). These initiatives will double its portfolio by FY30, strengthening retail dominance. The company continues to diversify and expand its office portfolio within its existing mall properties across key locations.Management expects Phoenix Mills office portfolio to grow nearly fourfold to 7.1msf by FY27, driving a rental income CAGR of 71% over FY25–27.Looking ahead, new malls under construction and large-scale redevelopments are expected to drive strong consumption growth beyond FY27. We estimate revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 17%/27%/50% over FY25–27.

South Korea struck a deal with the United States, on Sunday, securing the release of its nationals detained during an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.Presidential chief of staff, Kang Hoon-sik, declared that the two nations had completed negotiations and only administrative formalities were pending. He further added that Seoul would arrange a chartered flight to bring the workers back once those steps were finalised.According to foreign minister Cho Hyun, more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people taken into custody during Thursday’s operation.The raid was part of the Trump administration’s broader deportation drive, but stood out because of its scale and its focus on a major manufacturing project described by state leaders as Georgia’s largest economic development initiative.Footage released by US immigration and customs enforcement showed convoys of vehicles entering the site as federal agents ordered workers to assemble outside. Several were made to press their hands against a bus before being frisked and shackled at the wrists, ankles and waist.The operation targeted a plant still under construction, where Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are working together to produce batteries for electric vehicles.During the operation, several workers had attempted to flee.

India’s diesel exports to Europe surge

August Export Spike





The European Union’s latest restrictions on Russian crude oil have led to a massive surge in diesel shipments from India. India's diesel shipments to Europe jumped 137% year-on-year, reaching 242,000 barrels per day (bpd) in August 2025, as customers prepared for the European Union's upcoming restrictions starting January 2026 on fuels processed from Russian crude.According to an ET report, the new rules could potentially restrict the market for Reliance Industries, India's primary processor of Russian oil and leading fuel exporter.Industry experts attributed this significant increase to several factors: an unexpected early maintenance schedule at a major refinery, anticipated winter requirements, and forthcoming EU regulations that might restrict Indian supplies. They anticipate European demand for Indian diesel to maintain strong levels throughout 2025.Also Read | The 50% misfire: How Trump made Russian oil cheaper for India - And Putin a winner According to Kpler, a global data and analytics service, August diesel exports to Europe increased 73% from last month and surpassed the past year's monthly average by 124%.Vortexa, another energy shipment monitoring firm, reported Indian diesel exports to Europe in August at 228,316 bpd, showing a 166% increase year-on-year and 36% growth from July.Different shipping data monitors often provide varying export figures.The surge in late August shipments, particularly to Rotterdam, seems to be compensating for the shortfall caused by unexpected refinery maintenance, Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst, refining and modelling at Kpler was quoted as saying by ET. ""Exports rose sharply as Shell's Pernis (Netherlands) refinery advanced its planned turnaround from 2026. This has surprised the market,"" he said.One industry expert suggested that the early maintenance schedule could be a strategic move anticipating the post-January situation, when European markets may cease accepting Indian petroleum products refined from Russian crude.Also Read | 'One-sided' trade myth: Why Donald Trump is wrong - How US profits big from India US officials have strongly criticised India, alleging that its refineries are generating excessive profits by purchasing Russian crude at discounted rates and selling the processed products to Western nations, thus indirectly supporting Moscow's military operations.India has dismissed these allegations, stating that Western nations have the option to stop purchasing Indian fuel products if they have concerns.India's exporters anticipate robust demand from Europe throughout this year. ""European buyers may accelerate liftings from India given that Middle Eastern refineries will be having a high maintenance in October-November, echoing the stockpiling seen ahead of the February 2023 EU ban on Russian products,"" Ritola said.Europe relies heavily on Middle Eastern refineries as crucial suppliers.India's diesel exports witnessed a significant increase, reaching 603,000 bpd in August, showing an approximate 17% rise compared to both July and the previous year's figures, as reported by Kpler, primarily due to increased European shipments.The EU's July sanctions announcement stipulated that importers must present proof of crude origin used in refined products from third countries. However, the practical implementation of these import restrictions remains unclear.Also Read | Reality check for Trump! Why blame India for Russian crude trade?

"Oil markets: OPEC+ to ramp up oil production; 1,37,000 barrels per day more from October",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/oil-markets-opec-to-ramp-up-oil-production-137000-barrels-per-day-more-from-october/articleshow/123749410.cms,"



Eight key members of the OPEC+ alliance announced plans to raise oil production again, in a move analysts view as an effort to secure a larger share of the global crude market.The “Voluntary Eight” (V8) – Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, on Sunday said that they would increase daily output by 137,000 barrels from next month, AFP reported.The decision comes as oil prices continue to slide, amid expectations of oversupply in the coming months. Historically, the wider OPEC+ group, which includes the 12-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, had agreed to output cuts totalling nearly six million barrels per day to prop up prices.Since April, the V8 nations have shifted their focus, prioritising market share through a series of production hikes rather than price support. Analysts had expected last week that the group might maintain current output levels in October.Oil prices have largely hovered between $65 and $70 per barrel this year, tumbling 12% as non-OPEC+ producers ramp up supply and trade tensions weigh on demand.The announcement has surprised markets by signalling a fresh production hike, despite falling oil prices and concerns over global demand.The group, which had already lifted output by 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in recent months, said in a statement after an online meeting on Sunday that the new cycle could eventually see up to an additional 1.65 million bpd coming onto the market.""OPEC+ caught the market off guard today -- instead of pausing, the group signalled ambition with a production hike. The barrels may be small, but the message is big,"" said Jorge Leon, an analyst at Rystad Energy.He added, ""OPEC+ is prioritising market share even if it risks softer prices.""The analyst further noted that the real increase would likely be much smaller due to capacity limits and the compensation mechanism, but stressed that market perception often outweighs the actual number of barrels.""The move raises questions about unity: countries like Russia depend on high prices to fund their war machine, while others are willing to test lower prices for market share,"" the analyst told AFP.The coming three months, traditionally a weaker demand period, will prove a major test for the alliance. Market watchers are also monitoring geopolitical factors, including Moscow’s war in Ukraine and strained US-Russia relations.US President Donald Trump, who has failed in efforts to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, has recently targeted Russian oil exports. In August, he imposed higher tariffs on India for continuing to buy Russian crude.Speaking to Ukraine’s allies via video conference in Paris last Thursday, Trump voiced frustration at continued EU imports of Russian oil, particularly by Hungary and Slovakia.Analysts suggest that curbing Russian exports could open more market space for OPEC+ nations.","Eight key members of the OPEC+ alliance announced plans to raise oil production again.

‘India Profiting From Russian Oil’: Scott Bessent Hits Out Again Over Arbitrage, But Backs China

Russia crude oil trade: More tariffs, sanctions?





US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called on the European Union to join America in adding pressure on Russia, and indicating possibility of more tariffs on countries buying Russian crude oil. The Donald Trump administration has already imposed 25% additional tariffs on India for its oil trade with Russia, accusing it of indirectly financing the Russia-Ukraine war.The total tariffs on India now stand at 50% - marking one of the steepest duty rates imposed on any nation globally, due to India's ongoing Russian oil imports during the Ukraine conflict.According to an NBC News report, Bessent indicated on Sunday that the United States is willing to collaborate with European nations on implementing additional sanctions targeting countries purchasing Russian oil, aiming to destabilise the Russian economy.""We are prepared to increase pressure on Russia, but we need our European partners to follow us,"" Bessent told NBC News.Also Read | Trump tariffs on India’s software exports?

India’s diaspora population has expanded to 3.43 crore, making it the largest in the world, according to a government reply in Lok Sabha quoted in an ET report. It is evenly split between Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) and Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), each at 1.71 crore.India’s diaspora also plays a major role in the economy. Remittances touched a record $135.46 billion in 2024-25, up 14% from the previous year, according to RBI data cited in the report.India has remained the top global recipient of remittances for over a decade, the World Bank notes.Nearly half of India’s global diaspora resides in just ten countries. The United States leads with 56.9 lakh Indians, followed by the UAE (38.9 lakh), Malaysia (29.3 lakh), and Saudi Arabia (27.5 lakh), according to the ET report.The Gulf continues to be a hub for NRIs, with 76.5 lakh Indians in UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. In contrast, PIOs are concentrated in the West, with about 66 lakh in the US, UK, and Canada, forming nearly 40% of the global PIO population, the report said.Smaller countries also host notable Indian communities, including Mauritius (8.9 lakh), Fiji (3.1 lakh), Trinidad & Tobago (5.4 lakh), Guyana (3.2 lakh), Suriname (1.8 lakh), and Reunion Island (3 lakh).India has 38 Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) centres abroad, in cities including London, Sydney, Kuala Lumpur, Johannesburg, Berlin, Beijing, and Tokyo.However, the United States, despite hosting the largest Indian diaspora, has no ICCR centre. In such cases, embassy officers manage cultural activities, ET reported.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) operates 219 Missions and Posts worldwide and has signed migration and mobility partnership agreements with seven countries.Joint Working Groups with GCC countries meet regularly to address migrant worker welfare.External affairs minister S Jaishankar has in the past said, “To promote intellectual engagement, research grants are offered by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare for NRI, PIO, and OCI scholars working in priority areas in India.

Internet services across parts of Asia and the Middle East faced disruptions after undersea cables in the Red Sea were cut, experts said on Sunday.While concerns were raised over possible sabotage amid ongoing conflict in the region, it was not immediately clear what caused the incident, according to the news agency Associated Press.Microsoft said on its status page that the Middle East “may experience increased latency due to undersea fiber cuts in the Red Sea,” though internet traffic outside the region was not affected.NetBlocks, a global watchdog monitoring internet access, reported “a series of subsea cable outages in the Red Sea” had degraded connectivity in several countries, including India and Pakistan.It identified failures impacting the South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 4 (SMW4) and the India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE) cable systems near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.The SMW4 is run by Tata Communications, part of India’s Tata Group, while IMEWE is managed by a consortium overseen by Alcatel-Lucent. Both firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment, as per AP.Pakistan Telecommunications Co. Ltd. confirmed the cuts in a statement on Saturday. In the UAE, users of state-owned Du and Etisalat networks also complained of slower speeds, though authorities there and in Saudi Arabia did not comment.Submarine cables, a key part of global internet infrastructure, are vulnerable to ship anchors or deliberate attacks. Repairs typically take weeks, requiring specialised vessels to locate and fix the damage.The disruption comes as Yemen’s Houthi rebels continue attacks linked to the Israel-Hamas war. While speculation has grown about their role in targeting subsea infrastructure, the group has denied previous responsibility.On Sunday, the Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite channel acknowledged reports of the outages, citing NetBlocks, but did not claim involvement.From late 2023 through 2024, the Houthis struck over 100 ships in the Red Sea using missiles and drones, sinking four and killing at least eight mariners.Their campaign, which they frame as pressure on Israel over Gaza, has drawn retaliatory airstrikes.Earlier this year, Yemen’s internationally recognised government accused the Houthis of planning to attack cables, though the group denied it.","Internet services across parts of Asia and the Middle East faced disruptions after undersea cables in the Red Sea were cut.

What do Trump, aides want?





President Trump has identified three candidates as frontrunners to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair: his advisor Kevin Hassett, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, and sitting Fed governor Christopher Waller.At the White House, Trump told reporters that Scott Bessent was initially considered, but the Treasury secretary declined interest. “I had four,” Trump said. “Now I'm talking about three. He (Bessent) told me: 'I'm not leaving.'”currently serves as Director of the National Economic Council in the United States. He was previously the 29th Chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers from 2017 to 2019 and was later recalled to the White House as a Senior Advisor to President Trump to guide data-driven decisions in response to the Coronavirus.was sworn in as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on February 24, 2006, and served until March 31, 2011. Born in Albany, New York, Warsh earned a bachelor’s degree with honors in public policy, focusing on economics and statistics, from Stanford University in 1992. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he studied the intersection of law, economics, and regulatory policy, receiving his law degree in 1995.took office as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on December 18, 2020, filling an unexpired term ending January 31, 2030. Before joining the Board, Dr Waller was executive vice president and director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis from 2009. He also served as a professor and held the Gilbert F. Schaefer Chair of Economics at the University of Notre Dame.Trump is reportedly seeking a Fed chairman who will support his agenda for faster interest rate reductions, according to Reuters. He has repeatedly criticised Powell for delaying action on borrowing costs, which he says has contributed to higher mortgage rates for homebuyers.Powell’s Federal Reserve has maintained steady rates throughout the year—initially due to concerns that Trump’s tariffs could fuel inflation, and more recently in response to a weakening employment market.Kevin Warsh has long advocated for fundamental changes in Federal Reserve leadership, while Waller, who led research at the St. Louis Fed before being appointed Fed governor in 2020 by Trump, is considered a conventional choice.Bessent, on Friday, launched a comprehensive critique of the Federal Reserve, calling for a thorough review of its personnel, research functions, and monetary policy decisions.","President Trump has identified three candidates as frontrunners to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair.

'Unfair, Unjustified, Unreasonable': India Slams Trump’s 25% Additional Tariff Over Russian Oil





US President Donald Trump lashed out at the European Union on Friday for imposing a $3.5 billion antitrust fine on Google, calling it “unfair” and warning of retaliatory action if the bloc does not withdraw the penalty.“Europe today 'hit' another great American company, Google, with a $3.5 Billion Dollar fine, effectively taking money that would otherwise go to American Investments and Jobs,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.“Very unfair, and the American taxpayer will not stand for it! As I have said before, my Administration will NOT allow these discriminatory actions to stand.”Trump added, “We cannot let this happen to brilliant and unprecedented American Ingenuity and, if it does, I will be forced to start a Section 301 proceeding to nullify the unfair penalties being charged to these Taxpaying American Companies.”His remarks came a day after he hosted Google chief executive Sundar Pichai and co-founder Sergey Brin at the White House, where he praised them for a US court decision rejecting the government’s attempt to force the sale of Google’s Chrome browser in a separate antitrust case.The European Commission had fined Google 2.95 billion euros ($3.5 billion) on Friday, ruling that the company abused its dominant position by favoring its own digital advertising services.Regulators also ordered the company to end “self-preferencing practices” and resolve “conflicts of interest” across the ad-tech supply chain.Google rejected the decision, saying it would appeal. “It imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money,” said Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company’s global head of regulatory affairs.“There’s nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before,” she added.The EU ruling follows a three-year investigation launched in 2021. While regulators had raised the possibility of forcing a breakup of Google’s ad business, they stopped short of taking that step.The company also faces ongoing scrutiny in the United States, where the Justice Department has sought the divestment of its AdX and DFP platforms.","US President Donald Trump lashed out at the European Union on Friday for imposing a $3.5 billion antitrust fine on Google.

"Elon Musk package: Tesla board files $1 trillion Musk pay plan if 12 goals met; targets include robotaxis, AI bots",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-package-tesla-board-files-1-trillion-musk-pay-plan-if-12-goals-met-targets-include-robotaxis-ai-bots/articleshow/123720440.cms,"



Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be in line for a payout worth as much as $1 trillion if the electric carmaker meets a series of highly ambitious targets over the next decade, according to a regulatory filing released on Friday, the news agency AP reported.The proposed package includes a dozen share tranches linked to goals ranging from vehicle deliveries to market valuation. Tesla would need to hit a $2 trillion market cap, deliver 20 million cars, deploy one million robotaxis, and roll out one million AI-powered bots early in the plan. Musk must stay with the company for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to receive the full amount.The filing also noted that the 11th and 12th tranches require Musk to present a framework for succession planning. The EV maker’s annual shareholders’ meeting is scheduled for November 6. At its last meeting in June 2024, investors restored Musk’s earlier $44.9 billion pay package that had been struck down by a Delaware court.The targets come as Tesla battles declining sales, intensifying competition from Detroit rivals and China’s BYD, and a sharp erosion in its European market share. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association reported Tesla sales in the EU plunged 40% year-on-year in July, dropping its market share to 0.7% while BYD rose to 1.1%.Tesla’s financials have also faltered. Quarterly profit fell to $409 million from $1.39 billion a year earlier, with revenue missing Wall Street’s lowered forecasts. Investors have expressed concern about Musk’s focus, with the billionaire spending much of this year in Washington as a prominent figure in President Donald Trump’s administration.Despite the turbulence, Tesla said the package was designed to “retain and incentivize Elon” and align his performance with shareholder value. Last month, Tesla awarded Musk a $29 billion stock grant as a “first step” in retaining him, even as a Delaware judge revoked his 2018 pay deal for a second time. Tesla has appealed the ruling.Tesla shares rose nearly 2% in premarket trading on Friday following the filing.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk could be in line for a payout worth as much as $1 trillion if the electric carmaker meets a series of highly ambitious targets over the next decade.

Asian shares advanced on Friday, tracking Wall Street’s record close, as investors looked ahead to key US jobs data that could pave the way for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order implementing tariff cuts under an agreement with Japan announced in July, lowering duties on Japanese automobile imports and formalising a $550 billion investment pledge.According to news agency Reuters, the order reduces the tariff on Japanese autos from 27.5% to 15%, with the change taking effect within seven days of its publication in the Federal Register.The modifications will also apply retroactively to goods shipped from August 7, the date higher duties on dozens of economies took effect, as per news agency AFP.Other imports from Japan that previously faced tariffs above 15% will not be subject to an additional levy, while goods below that rate will be adjusted to 15%.Japan’s top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa welcomed the move, telling reporters in Washington that the step was a “steady implementation of the agreement reached on July 22.” Akazawa’s trip marked his 10th round of talks with US officials. “Finally,” he posted on X, signalling relief after months of negotiations.But he also cautioned that the 15% tariff would “still cause damage to our nation’s industries,” adding that Tokyo would take “swift and necessary measures, like financing assistance” to support affected sectors, as per AFP.According to Japan Today, the order also granted Japan “reciprocal” treatment on duties, correcting an earlier omission when similar provisions were extended to the EU.A memorandum of understanding was signed between Akazawa and US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, covering Japan’s planned “strategic investments” in the United States. “This is historic,” Lutnick said at the signing.The deal commits Japan to invest $550 billion in US projects through equity, loans, and guarantees from state-backed banks, with Washington retaining authority to select projects.Trump has said the United States will keep 90 percent of the profits from these investments, which Japan clarified will largely consist of loans and loan guarantees.Investments will target critical sectors such as minerals, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals.Trump said the inflows would “generate hundreds of thousands of US jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.”As part of the arrangement, Japan has agreed to increase its annual purchases of US agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, and fertiliser, to $8 billion, along with a 75% rise in rice imports.The agreement also includes Japan buying 100 Boeing planes and lifting defence spending with US firms to $17 billion annually, up from $14 billion, Reuters noted.Toyota, which last month estimated a $10 billion hit from earlier US tariffs, praised the order for providing “much needed clarity.”While shares of Japanese automakers rose slightly on Friday, South Korean carmakers remained under pressure as Seoul awaits a similar executive order from Washington.The deal comes at a sensitive moment for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose leadership faces a test with his ruling party set to vote on a possible extraordinary election.Analysts cited by Reuters said that while finalising the trade pact could strengthen Ishiba’s position, he still faces internal backlash over rising living costs and weak economic growth.","US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order implementing tariff cuts under an agreement with Japan announced in July.

Boost for US agriculture and manufacturing









President Donald Trump on Thursday (US local time) signed an executive order formally implementing the US-Japan trade agreement, a landmark pact that lowers tariffs on Japanese autos to 15% and secures a $550 billion investment pledge from Tokyo, the White House announced.The White House confirmed the move in a statement posted on X.Under the agreement, nearly all Japanese imports entering the United States will face a baseline tariff of 15%. For automobiles, the rate drops from 27.5 % to 15% — a significant victory for Japanese automakers.In a statement, the White House emphasised Tokyo’s unprecedented investment pledge: “Critically, unlike any other agreement in American history, the Government of Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States.”The projects will be selected by US officials and are expected to create thousands of jobs, strengthen domestic manufacturing, and boost infrastructure. Japan has also agreed to purchase US-made commercial aircraft and defense equipment.The executive order also outlines sector-specific treatment for automobiles and parts, aerospace products, generic pharmaceuticals, and natural resources not produced in the USJapan pledged to increase rice imports under its Minimum Access rice scheme and commit to annual purchases of American corn, soybeans, fertilizer, and bioethanol — a package worth about $8 billion.According to the executive order, the agreement “levels the playing field for American producers, accounts for national security needs, expands US exports and investment-driven production, and helps reduce the trade deficit with Japan.”The changes will take effect within seven days of being published in the Federal Register. The signing coincided with the arrival of Japan’s lead negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, in Washington for another round of talks.The announcement came just as Japan’s lead trade negotiator, Akazawa Ryosei, departed Thursday for a three-day visit to Washington for a new round of talks, reported ANI.","President Donald Trump on Thursday (US local time) signed an executive order formally implementing the US-Japan trade agreement.

US trade: Businesses front-load imports ahead of tariffs in July; deficit hits widest in 4 months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-trade-businesses-front-load-imports-ahead-of-tariffs-in-july-deficit-hits-widest-in-4-months/articleshow/123702976.cms,"FIEO chief warns 50% US tariff hits over half of exports, MSMEs staring at crisis





The US trade gap widened sharply in July, hitting its largest level in four months, as businesses rushed in imports ahead of fresh tariffs from US President Donald Trump.Figures from the department of commerce on Thursday showed the deficit rose by 32.5% to $78.3 billion. Imports jumped 5.9% to $358.8 billion, while exports increased only slightly, up 0.3% to $280.5 billion.""While imports bounced back in July, more than half of the increase was due to gold as trade policy and safe-haven demand brought about a resurgence in trade,"" said Matthew Martin, senior economist at Oxford Economics told AFP.""Excluding gold, imports rose by a more modest 3.3%, while exports fell 0.1%,"" Martin added.Pantheon Macroeconomics analysts described the widening shortfall as the result of ""another wave of pre-tariff stockpiling.""Trump initially introduced a 10% tariff on most trading partners in April. Plans to raise these levies were postponed twice before taking effect in early August, affecting key allies such as the European Union, Japan and India.Economists believe businesses that front-loaded imports are now running low on existing stocks, meaning they will soon face higher costs when they place new orders.For now, however, the broader impact on inflation in the US remains limited.A Briefing.com poll of forecasters had expected the deficit to come in much smaller, at $64.2 billion.Martin noted that strong demand for capital goods linked to artificial intelligence and data centres had also pushed up imports. The Commerce Department added that inflows of industrial supplies and consumer goods both rose strongly.Trade with China played a significant role, with the US goods deficit widening by $5.3 billion to $14.7 billion in July.""Unsurprisingly, given the level of tariffs, China has been the hardest hit of all trading partners,"" Martin said. Goods from the world’s second-largest economy are now subject to an additional 30% tariff this year, while other Asian nations face lower rates.Trump’s tariff strategy has rattled global supply chains, with import surges recorded as early as March, before his wide-ranging duties began in April.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

'Hegemony Unacceptable, Will Resist': Ramapshosa Denounces Trump Trade Onslaught, Tariff Blackmail

The United States and Taiwan deepened their commercial relations on Thursday, signing a trade deal. Under the agreement, Taiwanese imports to the US will be getting lower tariffs while the island nation has committed to purchase and invest in American products.The step confirms a framework first presented in January. Under that plan, duties applied by Washington on numerous Taiwanese exports are being reduced from 20% to 15%, alongside efforts to bring in more Taiwanese capital into the US technology industry.Before it can take effect, the pact must pass review in Taiwan’s parliament, which is controlled by the opposition. US trade representative Jamieson Greer said the deal ""will eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers facing US exports to Taiwan.""""This agreement also builds on our longstanding economic and trade relationship with Taiwan and will significantly enhance the resilience of our supply chains, particularly in high-technology sectors,"" he added in a statement.Taiwanese vice premier Cheng Li-chiun said that the outcome improves the island’s competitive position, placing it on a ""fair footing to compete with our rivals.""""Compared with our competitor countries, we have even gained a relative advantage, because the gap created by FTAs that previously left us behind has effectively been closed this time,"" Cheng told a press conference in Washington, referring to free trade agreements.He said Taipei had obtained ""Most Favored Nation"" treatment and achieved a reduction in the average charge ""on our exports to the US from an initial 15 percent, without stacking reciprocal tariffs, further down to an average of 12.33 percent.""A fact sheet from the US Trade Representative’s office sets out Taiwan’s intention to drive a ""long-term increase in its purchases of important US goods"" through 2029.Those purchases are expected to cover $44.4 billion in liquefied natural gas and crude oil, $15.2 billion in civil aircraft and engines, and another $25.2 billion spanning power equipment, electricity grids and other items.The document also notes that the United States agreed to ease its tariff levels on Taiwanese products after Taipei committed to taking ""significant steps to advance a stronger and more reciprocal trade relationship.""In addition, Taiwan has undertaken to cut most of its own tariff barriers and open the way for preferential access for American industrial and agricultural exports.","The United States and Taiwan deepened their commercial relations on Thursday, signing a trade deal.

Budget 2026: A turning point for financial services firms looking to set up GCCs in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-a-turning-point-for-financial-services-firms-looking-to-set-up-gccs-in-india/articleshow/128291192.cms,"Budget 2026 also strengthens India’s attractiveness through its broader posture on foreign investment and cross-border financial integration.

Budget 2026 Overview: What Citizens And Businesses Should Know

(Radhika Saigal is FS Consulting Leader and Manoj Marwah is FS GCC Consulting Leader at EY India)

Union Budget 2026 propels India towards building a stable, scalable and globally competitive financial ecosystem that encourages global financial institutions to evaluate India not only as a growth market but also as a strategic base for delivery, innovation and risk-managed expansion.A key driver of investor confidence is the simplification and predictability through targeted tax provisions and reforms that reduces administrative overhead. One of the most consequential announcements in this context is the sharpening of India’s transfer pricing and tax certainty framework for technology and service-led operations—directly relevant for global companies running Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in India.The Budget proposes a significantly expanded Safe Harbour regime for IT services, with a uniform safe harbour margin of 15.5% and an enhanced threshold that rises from ₹300 crore to ₹2,000 crore. Earlier differences between KPO, BPO, and other services often led to classification issues, especially for diversified and larger GCCs. A single margin better reflects how modern GCCs operate today, with integrated technology, analytics, and business functions.This also brings a much larger share of mid-sized and large GCCs within the Safe Harbour framework, while also reducing uncertainty for smaller centres that are scaling. At this scale, the threshold covers GCCs with headcounts of up to ~6,000-8,000, bringing around 80% of financial services (FS) GCCs within the framework – with the remaining 20 % covered by the Advance Pricing Agreements (APA) for whom also the timeline has been reduced to two years.These APAs help companies agree in advance on how their cross-border transactions (GCC & HQ) will be taxed, reducing the risk of future disputes. Earlier, this process could take several years, creating uncertainty for global firms operating GCCs in India. The faster timeline provides quicker tax clarity, making it easier for companies to plan investments, expand teams, and move higher-value work to India with greater confidence.By easing a long-standing compliance and transfer pricing burden, the change allows GCCs across sizes to plan expansion with greater confidence. It also proposes consolidating multiple service segments (including IT services, IT-enabled services and knowledge process outsourcing, and contract R&D) under a single category. For GCC-heavy global firms—many of whom support core banking platforms, digital channels, analytics, cybersecurity, operations and finance processes from India—this is a material development. It provides a predictable operating model for multi-year planning.Beyond taxation, the Budget introduces targeted fiscal incentives and skilling grants for Tier-2 cities such as Kochi, Indore, and Coimbatore. These measures aim to ease the pressure on metro cities while enabling GCCs to access new talent pools. This supports balanced regional growth as currently FS GCCs have scanty presence in non-metros.For global FS firms, the strategic impact is larger than transfer pricing alone. This framework supports a shift from India being viewed merely as a cost-efficient offshore center to being recognised as a stable, long-term delivery hub where scale can be pursued with fewer structural uncertainties. In practical terms, it enables leadership teams to make bolder commitments on headcount growth, product engineering expansion, and investments in data platforms and AI delivery from India, without the same degree of annual pricing and audit volatility. The option to continue safe harbour treatment for multiple years further strengthens the case for long-horizon operating models and long-term investments.Budget 2026 also strengthens India’s attractiveness through its broader posture on foreign investment and cross-border financial integration. Global firms tend to favour jurisdictions that combine growth with operational stability, and where the policy environment supports both local business development and global connectivity. This benefits international banks, insurers, asset managers and fintechs in evaluating India as a key node in their global growth strategy.A further tailwind for global FS investment and GCC scaling in India could come from the reported reduction of US tariffs to ~18%, which may improve the overall outlook for cross-border trade flows and global supply chains. When combined with Budget 2026’s safe harbour framework that enhances transfer pricing certainty for IT services, this creates a reinforcing cycle: higher global business activity drives greater FS servicing needs, while India’s improved regulatory and tax predictability strengthens the case for locating long-term capability build and critical delivery functions in India.",Budget 2026 also strengthens India’s attractiveness through its broader posture on foreign investment and cross-border financial integration. A key driver of investor confidence is the simplification and predictability through targeted tax provisions and reforms that reduces administrative overhead. The Budget proposes a significantly expanded Safe Harbour regime for IT services.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128291250,imgsize-137184,width-400,resizemode-4/budget-2026-growth.jpg"
"IT stocks selloff continues!

IT stocks continued to trade in red on Friday. The sector extended its fall as investor sentiments were dragged down by fears of disruption from artificial intelligence and fading expectations of an early interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve.At 9:50 am, the Nifty IT index slumped 4.59%, or 1,520 points, to trade at 31,639, reflecting broad-based weakness across technology counters. Infosys fell 85 points, or 6.13%, to 1,299 on the NSE, while TCS declined 4.77% to 2,619. HCLTech and Wipro dropped 4.48% and 3.64%, respectively, and Tech Mahindra was lower by 2.66%. In the mid-tier space, Coforge tumbled 1,345 points, or 5.32%, Persistent lost 3.16% to 5,279, and LTIMindtree slipped 3.62% to 5,023.This comes just a day after the 10 stock pack Nifty IT index emerged as the worst performing segment on Thursday, plunging close to its lowest level in almost 10 months and continuing to be the weakest sector for this year, so far.In US, American Depository Receipts of Infosys and Wipro retreated sharply, extending losses for a second straight session. Infosys ended down as much as 10% at $14.21 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Wipro shed 5% to finish at $2.28.The weakness follows a brutal outing in the previous trade when the Nifty IT index dived up to 5.5% and several heavyweights cracked as much as 6%, according to ET.Traders expect the pressure to radiate across the wider technology universe, keeping stocks such as Coforge, Persistent Systems, LTIMindtree and HCLTech firmly in focus.The immediate trigger for the latest bout of anxiety has been a new offering from Anthropic, the firm known for the Claude chatbot. Investors see the move as another reminder that AI adoption could intensify rivalry, squeeze profitability and chip away at the competitive strengths traditionally enjoyed by IT services companies, according to ET. Sentiment towards software exporters had already been fragile, and the announcement deepened the caution.According to VK Vijayakumar from Geojit Investments, ""Tech stocks, reeling under the Anthropic shock, are unlikely to recover soon."" According to some market watchers, as much as 40% of revenue could be at risk if automated systems take over work once handled by human employees.Brokerage house Motilal Oswal also flagged risks, arguing that AI may render traditional software development and testing assignments less critical. However, it recommended keeping an eye on potential tie-ups in the coming three to six months that could pave the way for fresh AI-led deals by mid-2026.","At 9:50 am, the Nifty IT index slumped 4.59%, or 1,520 points, to trade at 31,639.

Indian benchmark indices traded within a narrow range during the week, exhibiting a positive bias amid supportive domestic cues. Market sentiment remained constructive, underpinned by a revival in Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) inflows. After a phase of sustained outflows, FIIs have turned net buyers, reflecting renewed confidence in India’s macroeconomic fundamentals. The continuation of these inflows is expected to lend further support to equities, particularly in light of improving GDP growth expectations.Investor attention has gradually shifted toward the concluding phase of the third-quarter earnings season. Market participants are closely evaluating corporate earnings performance and forward-looking management commentary to gauge the sustainability of earnings growth. Additionally, upcoming inflation data will be a key monitorable in both India and US, as it may influence expectations regarding the Reserve Bank of India’s and US FOMC future rate decision.Developments related to the proposed trade agreement also remain in focus, with reports suggesting that the final contours are nearing completion. Greater clarity on this front could provide incremental direction to the markets in the near term.Overall, the market undertone remains cautiously optimistic, supported by improving macroeconomic indicators and stabilizing external flows.Nifty post the RBI monetary policy outcome rebounded from the support area of 20 days EMA and tested the immediate resistance area of 26,000 in Wednesday session.Going forward, index sustaining above the key psychological level of 26,000, will open upwards toward the key resistance area of 26,200–26,300 in the coming sessions. However, if it fails to move above the 26,000 levels, the index is likely to consolidate in the range of 25,500-26,000.The overall outlook remains positive, and market dips should be seen as buying opportunities. Immediate support is placed at 25,500–25,400, which aligns with last week’s breakout area and the 20-day EMA.Volatility is likely to remain elevated amid uncertain global cues and the rising crude oil prices.BANKNIFTYBank Nifty traded in a range with positive bias during the current week. PSU banking stocks extended their outperformance.Going ahead, a move above 61,000 levels will lead to further upside toward the 61,400 and 61,800 levels in the coming sessions. Failure to move above 61,000 will signal some consolidation in the range of 59,800-60,800 levelsBias remains positive and we believe dips should be used as buying opportunity, with short term support seen at 59500-59200 levels being the confluence of the 20- and 50-days EMA. Volatility is likely to remain elevated amid uncertain global cuesThe stock is at the cusp of generating a breakout above a falling supply line joining the highs of October 2025 and January 2026 signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.We expect the stock to head towards 413 levels in the coming quarters being the high of October 2025 and the upper band of the last 12 months range.Daily 14 periods RSI is in uptrend and is seen sustaining above its nine periods average thus supports the positive bias in the stock.Buying demand is seen emerging from the 52 weeks EMA and the previous major low of October 2025 signaling strength and offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock during last week formed a bullish engulfing candle signaling strength and opening upside towards 332 levels being the 123.6% external retracement of the previous decline.The daily 14 periods RSI is seen rebounding, taking support at its nine periods average thus supports the positive bias in the stock.

Adani to enter nuclear power via atomic energy arm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-to-enter-nuclear-power-via-atomic-energy-arm/articleshow/128323228.cms,"MUMBAI: After the Tata and JSW Groups, the Adani Group is firming up plans to enter the nuclear energy sector. This week, the Ahmedabad-based infrastructure conglomerate incorporated a new company, Adani Atomic Energy, for the purpose. The company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Power, will ""generate, transmit and distribute electricity derived from nuclear and atomic energy,"" Adani Power said in a regulatory filing.The move follows India's decision to open the nuclear sector to private participation as part of its long-term energy transition strategy. The govt aims to raise nuclear capacity to 100 GW by 2047 from the current nine GW. Nuclear currently accounts for about 3% of India's total power generation, with a target to increase its share to 10% by 2047.Adani's entry into nuclear power has drawn criticism from opposition parties, which allege that recent regulatory changes were designed to ease the group's entry into the sector. Following Adani Power's stock exchange filing, Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said on X that the legislation was being enacted to ""favour the favourite,"" referring to the Shanti bill as ""Shriman Adani's Nuclear Tech Initiative.Under the Shanti bill, private companies are permitted to build, own and operate nuclear power plants, including small modular reactors, through partnerships. It also allows up to 49% FDI in the sector.However, uranium mining beyond specified thresholds will remain exclusively under govt control.

NEW DELHI: The India-US trade arrangement will expand cotton demand rather than hurt domestic growers, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday, while asserting Indian farmers stand to gain from rising textile exports.""This will also not hurt our cotton producers... I can see before my eyes a huge requirement for more cotton and a huge and wonderful future for our cotton,"" Goyal said at the ET NOW Global Business Summit.Explaining the mechanism, he said India will get the same concession that Bangladesh enjoys. ""The same concession is available to India also. It's called a yarn forward. If you buy cotton or yarn from the US and process it and use it for making garments, you are able to export it to the US at zero duty. That's an established principle of theirs. And India will benefit from the same way of working,"" he said.Goyal also said the reduction in US reciprocal tariffs from 50% to 18%, along with access at zero reciprocal for textiles in Europe, has made Indian exports significantly more competitive. ""We become extremely competitive. Let us convert this market access into market share,"" he said, projecting strong growth in sectors such as textiles, leather, footwear, handlooms, handicrafts and marine products.He said recent free trade agreements finalised by India have been structured to protect sensitive sectors, while expanding export opportunities. In the US deal, key agricultural products such as rice, wheat, corn and millets have been kept out to safeguard the interests of farmers. Similarly, India has not opened the dairy sector in any of its trade agreements, the minister said, noting that millions of small farmers depend on it for supplementary income.Goyal also said India has concluded nine free trade agreements in the last three-and-a-half years with 37 developed economies, effectively opening up access to over 70% of global trade. These pacts, he said, are aimed at providing certainty and predictability for businesses, attracting investment, creating jobs and integrating India more deeply with global markets.""There has never been a country that became developed while remaining insulated from the global economy,"" he said, adding that India's calibrated opening up is designed to balance consumer interests, farmer protection and export-led growth.On the issue of imports, where India and the US are eyeing $500 billion of shipments over five years, Goyal said, India needs coking coal to boost its steel production and the US is a major supplier of this commodity. ""...with the US, we are hopeful to get more aeroplanes into the country, which would be good for our tourism, which would be good for our mobility and hopefully bring down the airfares for all of us... It should open up remote area connectivity into the country,"" he said.""Very easily I can see before my eyes, just the aviation sector, meeting probably a hundred billion dollars of imports - Boeing planes, aircraft engines and spare parts in the next five years."" Goyal said India has used trade pacts to secure advantages such as investment commitments and better terms for Indian professionals abroad. FTAs, he said, are not just about tariffs but about ""trust, transparency and time-bound certainty"" that attract investment."," commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal says India-US trade arrangement will expand cotton demand rather than hurt domestic growers.

NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries Ltd has received a general licence from the US to directly buy Venezuelan crude without violating sanctions.Those familiar with the development said the licence allows RIL to purchase, refine, export and sell Venezuelan-origin oil that has already been extracted. They added Washington has granted similar licences to several entities globally, with RIL among them.Experts said granting the licence signals to Indian refiners to diversify energy purchases towards the US and Venezuela and reduce imports of Russian crude. The approval is likely to accelerate Venezuela’s oil exports and help refiners cut costs, as heavy crude from Caracas is sold at a discount. Venezuelan grades are typically heavy and sour, which can be processed at Reliance’s Jamnagar refineries.Reliance did not respond to requests for comment.Announcing the trade deal with India, US President Donald Trump linked tariff relief to India reducing Russian crude purchases and said Delhi should instead buy more oil from the US and potentially Venezuela. Caracas and Washington also reached a deal last month to export up to $2 billion worth of crude to the US.

Colombo Calling: Airfares, Hotel Bookings Rise Sharply Ahead Of Key T20 WC Match

Air ticket prices shoot up

MUMBAI: With arch-rivals India and Pakistan set to face off in the T20 World Cup in Colombo on Sunday, ad rates for the match have soared. Companies are rushing to book slots to place their brands and cash-in on the huge viewership the game is likely to attract.Ad rates for a 10-second TV slot are now selling in the range of about Rs 30-40 lakh which otherwise usually costs between Rs 20-25 lakh for major World Cup matches, industry experts tracking the space said. ""Rates for last minute inventory have jumped by at least 20%-25%. Every second of ad slots for the match will be taken,"" said senior sports analyst and commentator Neeraj Jha, projecting broadcaster JioStar to rake in ad revenues of about Rs 2,000 crore from the tournament.Ad rates for a 10-second slot on digital (JioHotstar) have spiked to around Rs 15-20 lakh. ""Companies want to own the ad space and money is not something they are thinking about. The viewership will be so large that firms do not want to miss out on the opportunity. There's a lot of interest from auto, FMCG, financial services and real estate companies,"" said Kushal Sanghvi, director at global marketing firm Komerz. The industry is equating ad rates for the Indo-Pak match to the price of gold and silver, said Sanghvi.JioStar did not share specific details of the advertisers for the India-Pakistan match but said that Emirates, OpenAI, Birla Opus, Rapido, Amul, Mahindra & Mahindra Auto, Hyundai, Britannia and General Insurance Council are among companies that are advertising in the World Cup.Indian cricket fans are headed to the Sri Lankan capital, taking prices of air tickets to Colombo and hotel fares in the city higher. Airfares to the city are trending significantly higher than non-event travel periods, particularly on high demand routes from major Indian metros, said Rikant Pittie, CEO and co-founder of EaseMyTrip. ""On select dates, round-trip fares have risen sharply compared to regular averages, with prices increasing by as much as 45%-50% further closer to departure.

Through its Amendment Directions, 2026, effective April 1, the central bank expands the credit activities commercial banks may undertake, with acquisition finance at the centre.The final circular is also more liberal than last year's draft, which was announced as part of comprehensive reforms in the wake of Trump's tariffs, indicating a shift from caution to confidence on the economy. The financing ceiling rises to 75% from the draft's 70%, reducing the acquirer's minimum equity contribution to 25% from 30%. Eligibility is widened, as the final framework admits both listed and unlisted borrowers.Ambiguity around balance-sheet strength is replaced by a minimum net worth of Rs 500 crore, while unlisted acquirers are explicitly permitted if they carry an investment-grade rating of BBB- or anything higher. Even the bar on related-party deals is refined and they continue to be prohibited in principle, but financing to increase stakes in already-controlled entities is now allowed.With the latest circular, Indian banks have finally been given room to finance corporate buyouts, a territory which was long dominated by multinational lenders.Lenders may fund Indian non-financial companies acquiring equity or compulsorily convertible debentures that confer control, subject to prudential caps on leverage, security and governance.The lending architecture is liberal by Indian standards but tightly hedged: funding may cover up to 75% of deal value, borrowers must maintain a consolidated debt-to-equity ratio within 3:1, and facilities must be secured by the acquired securities with corporate guarantees.The overhaul extends beyond buyouts. Banks can now lend against a defined pool of eligible securities including shares, govt securities and rated debt, within prescribed loan-to-value limits, with continuous monitoring and swift rectification of breaches. Capital-market intermediaries gain structured access to secured credit for operational needs, margin funding and settlement mismatches, though financing for proprietary trading remains barred and equity collateral attracts steep haircuts.RBI also issued draft norms for lending to Reits, in which it barred use of proceeds for land purchases. Banks may lend only to Sebi -registered, listed vehicles with 3-year plus track record, two-year positive distributable cash flows, clean regulatory history and no stressed special purpose vehicles.

The think tank said that as India targets $1 trillion in merchandise exports by 2030 under the Viksit Bharat vision, e-commerce exports are projected to scale rapidly to $200-300 billion.""This expansion could raise their share in India's total exports to 20-30% and their contribution to GDP to 2.9-4.3%, underscoring the potential of e-commerce to emerge as a key pillar of India's export strategy and broader economic growth,"" said the Aayog's quarterly Trade Watch.""Given India's 500 million-strong labour force and 63 million MSMEs contributing 29% of GDP and 43% of exports, e-commerce exports hold the potential to unlock new growth opportunities,"" said the report.It identified several challenges and constraints in the country's e-commerce ecosystem which include complex regulatory and compliance framework, absence of dedicated customs codes for e-commerce exports, inefficient reverse logistics and duty treatment of returns, lack of coordinated ecosystem support, absence of international cooperation framework and low awareness and institutional support.The report said global best practices show countries that have streamlined e-commerce such as China have introduced 24-hour digital customs clearance, dedicated cross-border pilot zones with tax incentives, and distinct supervision codes to simplify compliance, while also enabling platform-led logistics and a single-window duty-free returns system. It also cited the example of South Korea, which supports MSMEs through relaxed export declaration thresholds, consolidated packaging, and its export e-room model, reducing procedural burdens.The report also said that the US complements this with institutional backing through its e-commerce solutions centre and offering training, financing, and market linkages.","Electronics-oriented exports can contribute to export diversification, job creation, and overall economic growth, govt think tank Niti Aayog has said.

The ministry’s format for publishing these reports also specifies providing details such as actual execution status of refund, possession and compensation orders as well as recovery warrant execution details with values and list of defaulting builders.FPCE said annual report data is not only vital for homebuyers to assess system credibility, but is equally necessary for both state and central govts to frame effective policies, design incentivisation schemes, and develop tax policy frameworks.“Unless we have credible data proving that after Rera the real estate sector has improved in terms of delivery, fairness, and keeping its promises, we are merely firing in the air,” said FPCE president Abhay Upadhyay, who is also a member of the govt’s Central Advisory Council on Rera.As per details shared by the entity, seven states — Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Goa — have never published a single annual report since Rera’s implementation, and nine states, including Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana, which initially published reports, have discontinued the practice.Upadhyay said when regulators themselves don’t follow the law, they lose the legal right to demand compliance from other stakeholders. “Their failure emboldens builders and weakens the very system they are meant to safeguard,” he said.","More than 75% of state real estate regulators, Reras, have not published annual reports.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 109 points, or 0.2%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3%, AP reported.Treasury yields declined in the bond market after data showed inflation cooled more than economists had expected last month. Consumer prices were 2.4% higher year-on-year, lower than December’s 2.7%, though still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. An underlying inflation measure — considered a better predictor of future price trends — slowed to its lowest level in nearly five years.“It’s still too high, but only for now, not forever,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management.Cooling inflation could provide the Federal Reserve greater room to cut interest rates if required. While the Fed has paused rate cuts for now, markets broadly expect easing to resume later this year.Lower borrowing costs could support economic growth and equity markets, though they also carry the risk of reigniting inflation.The broader economic backdrop also appears stronger compared to late 2025, supported by easing inflation and stronger-than-expected job market data last month.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell to 4.06% from 4.09% on Thursday.On Wall Street, stocks of companies previously seen as vulnerable to AI disruption stabilised.

Meanwhile, memory chip maker YMTC was removed from the list.Inclusion in the list also signals to Pentagon suppliers and other US government agencies the military’s assessment of these firms. Some companies listed earlier have challenged their inclusion through legal routes.Responding to the move, an Alibaba spokesperson told Reuters that there was no basis for the inclusion and indicated possible legal action. “Alibaba is not a Chinese military company nor part of any military-civil fusion strategy.”The update to the list could strain ties between Washington and Beijing, particularly after a trade truce agreed between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in October.The list already includes major Chinese firms such as Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL. Tencent had earlier said its business would remain unaffected and that it would seek reconsideration, while CATL said it was “not engaged in any military-related activities”.US lawmakers had earlier urged the Pentagon to expand the list to include several Chinese technology companies, including AI firm DeepSeek, smartphone maker Xiaomi and display manufacturer BOE Technology.Along with YMTC, some firms included last year --such as COSCO SHIPPING Finance Co Ltd and ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc -- have now been removed from the list.","US President Donald Trump has added several major Chinese companies to a Pentagon list of firms allegedly supporting China's military.

UNMISSABLE: Names Of 6 'HIDDEN' Global Figures Finally Released In Unredacted Epstein Files | WATCH

Dubai-based port operator DP World on Friday announced new leadership, replacing long-time chief Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem after documents linked to the Epstein files revealed frequent correspondence between him and the convicted sex offender.""DP World announced the appointment of His Excellency Essa Kazim as Chairman of its Board of Directors and the appointment of Yuvraj Narayan as Group Chief Executive Officer,"" the group said in a statement published by the Dubai media office.The statement did not reference Sulayem.Previously serving as group chairman and chief executive officer of DP World, one of the world’s largest port operators, Sulayem was described by Jeffrey Epstein as one of his “most trusted friends.”He is cited more than 9,400 times in documents recently released by the US Department of Justice, which detail what they describe as close ties between the two men.According to the records, they maintained regular correspondence from 2009 to 2018, exchanging messages on personal matters, meetings, introductions and business opportunities.At the time, Epstein portrayed the wealthy Emirati businessman as being close to Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid.The correspondence also indicates that Sulayem visited Epstein at his residence in the United States on multiple occasions, including trips to his private island.DP World is one of the world’s largest port operators, responsible for a significant share of global container traffic.Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, has long been known for cultivating ties with powerful individuals across sectors. The newly released files underscore that even after his conviction, Epstein continued to connect with influential figures.For example, other reporting on the 2026 release shows Epstein’s role in facilitating meetings between business leaders and politicians, including those linked to UAE-Israel diplomatic backchannels and investment networks.","Long-time DP World chief Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem replaced by Essa Kazim.

"US inflation cools to 2.4% in January, near five-year low as gas and housing costs ease",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-cools-to-2-4-in-january-near-five-year-low-as-gas-and-housing-costs-ease/articleshow/128310871.cms,"A key measure of US inflation fell to nearly a five-year low in January as apartment rental price growth slowed and gas prices declined, offering some relief to consumers after years of sharp cost increases.Inflation dropped to 2.4% in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.7% in December and moving closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, AP reported. Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.5% year-on-year in January, down from 2.6% the previous month and marking the smallest increase since March 2021.The data suggests inflationary pressures could be easing, though it comes after prices of food, fuel and housing surged following the pandemic, leaving overall consumer prices about 25% higher than five years ago. The broad rise in costs has become a major political issue around affordability.On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.2% in January from December, while core prices increased 0.3%.The report may signal cooling inflation, though economists note that prices often rise more in January as companies reset pricing at the start of the year. While gas prices are expected to have declined, grocery costs could see upward pressure after rising in December.Inflation had surged to 9.1% in 2022 amid strong consumer spending and supply chain disruptions following the pandemic. It declined through 2023, stabilised around 3% by mid-2024, and has since improved only gradually.Inflation softened slightly in late 2025, partly reflecting distortions caused by a six-week government shutdown that disrupted data collection, leading to estimates for housing costs that economists said may have artificially lowered inflation readings.At the same time, wage growth has slowed as hiring momentum weakened, reducing workers’ bargaining power. Lower wage growth can ease inflation pressure as businesses face less cost pressure to raise prices.More moderate wage gains are a key reason many economists expect inflation to continue easing this year.“We're not expecting inflation to start up again by any stretch,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust, AP quoted him as saying.Some businesses are still absorbing tariff-related costs, though economists expect companies may raise prices in coming months to offset those expenses. However, most forecasts suggest inflation will decline further by the second half of the year and move closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target by the end of 2026.","Inflation dropped to 2.4% in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.7% in December.

India in talks with China’s Ant International to link UPI with Alipay+ for cross-border payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/india-in-talks-with-chinas-ant-international-to-link-upi-with-alipay-for-cross-border-payments/articleshow/128307429.cms,"Mending India-China ties

India is in discussions with China-related Ant International to allow integration of the digital payments platform Alipay+ with the country’s instant payments system, Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The move could ease cross-border transactions for Indian travellers across merchants that have signed up with Alipay+, Reuters reported, citing two government sources.This would heavily simplify the overseas spending and reduce the costs associated with cross-border payments.Ant International, headquartered in Singapore and founded by China’s Ant Group, now operates independently.According to Reuters, talks between Indian government and central bank officials with the firm indicate a thaw in bilateral economic engagement between New Delhi and Beijing.Alipay+ currently connects about 1.8 billion user accounts with more than 150 million merchants across over 100 markets, including several in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.Meanwhile, UPI has become a cornerstone of India’s fintech infrastructure, handling nearly 18 billion transactions monthly.Indian authorities have been keen to extend UPI’s international reach to enable smoother digital payments in Indian rupees for travellers and overseas Indians.However, final approval for the Alipay+ integration will depend on security evaluations.“There are sensitivities involved in terms of geopolitical positioning or in securing the country’s digital infrastructure and data because of Alipay’s roots in China,” Reuters reported, citing sources.India continues to enforce strict investment regulations for Chinese firms introduced after the 2020 border standoff, and those curbs remain in place.Strained relations between India and China after their 2020 border standoff slowed the flow of capital, technology and talent between the two neighbours, with New Delhi tightening scrutiny of investments by China-based firms or those with China-linked ownership, according to Reuters. The curbs have stalled or delayed several projects, including Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD’s proposed 1 billion dollar investment plan in an India EV venture.In the past year, however, India has begun cautiously rekindling engagement with Beijing as it navigates punishing U.S. tariffs and shifting global trade patterns, officials said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China in 2025 for the first time in seven years and discussed ways to improve ties in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.","India is in discussions with China-related Ant International to allow integration of the digital payments platform Alipay+ with the country’s instant payments system, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) The move could ease cross- border transactions for Indian travellers across merchants that have signed up with the platform.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128307560,imgsize-750127,width-400,resizemode-4/upi-and-alipay-talks.jpg"

China EXPLODES At Israel's Invasion Bid After Trump & 8 Muslim Nations | 'Not Your TERRITORY'

China has intensified efforts to cement its dominance over rare earth metals as the United States moves to build a broad international coalition to secure critical mineral supply chains, official and media reports said.Chinese Premier Li Qiang this week visited Ganzhou in Jiangxi province — one of the world’s largest heavy rare earth production bases — underscoring Beijing’s strategic focus on the sector that underpins advanced manufacturing and technology. Li inspected key producers, research institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Ganjiang Innovation Academy, and held talks with local business leaders and scientists, according to Chinese state media Xinhua.South China Morning Post quoted Li as saying, “The value of rare earths in boosting advanced manufacturing and green, low‑carbon transformation is increasingly prominent,” highlighting the role of these metals in high-tech and clean-energy industriesChina currently accounts for around 70 % of global rare earth mining and nearly 90 % of processing capacity, giving it substantial leverage in disputes with the United States and other major economies.Beijing’s tightened export controls last year led to disruptions in supply to the US, the EU, India, and other nations, prompting Washington to accelerate efforts to diversify sources of the minerals, which are essential for electronics, automobiles, wind turbines, and defence equipment.According to news agency PTI, China’s restrictions on rare earth supplies previously forced US President Donald Trump to agree to resume shipments to Washington in exchange for tariff concessions and lifting a semiconductor export ban.In response, the Trump administration this month launched a major initiative to form a metallic alliance with more than 50 nations, including India, aimed at securing critical mineral supply chains and reducing reliance on China. As part of this strategy, the US has unveiled a USD 12 billion stockpile plan dubbed “Project Vault” to finance domestic and allied mining and processing.Li also chaired a State Council meeting to push AI-driven innovation, emphasising the integration of data, computing, electricity, network resources, and hardware-software synergy to strengthen China’s technological edge, South China Morning Post reported.",China has intensified efforts to cement its dominance over rare earth metals.

WTO DG Okonjo-Iweala Lauds India’s Trade Strategy, Calls For Multilateral Leadership

The World Trade Organization (WTO) needs urgent structural reform as the global trading system undergoes rapid economic and technological shifts, WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said, warning that maintaining the current framework is no longer viable, AFP reported.Speaking in Geneva on Wednesday, Okonjo-Iweala said the global trade body and the broader multilateral system are at a decisive moment. “We are meeting today at an inflection point, not just for the WTO, but... for the multilateral system,” she said, adding that failure to preserve the global trading framework could trigger instability.“I don't think the status quo is an option,” she said.Reform is expected to be a central agenda item at the WTO ministerial meeting scheduled in Cameroon next month.The WTO, which governs large parts of global trade flows, has been facing operational challenges due to its consensus-based decision-making structure and a dispute settlement mechanism that has been weakened amid tensions with the United States. The organisation has also faced growing geopolitical pressures, which intensified after US President Donald Trump returned to the White House last year and trade tensions escalated.Okonjo-Iweala stressed that global institutions must evolve alongside rapid technological and economic transformation. “The world is moving so fast... If you look at the speed at which technology is moving, and AI is moving and quantum technologies are moving,” she said.“If your organisation doesn't adapt, then you'll be left behind,” she added.Highlighting the WTO’s role in providing trade certainty, she said the system continues to remain foundational despite growing challenges. “This organisation provides stability and predictability,” she said, adding that “in spite of all the knocks, it is still the bedrock for so much of world trade”.She cautioned that a breakdown of the multilateral trading framework would create widespread uncertainty for businesses and global commerce.“If we don't have this system, what does it mean? I'll be very honest with you: there'll be chaos,” she said.“It means a business will send goods somewhere without the knowledge of how those goods will be valued when it arrives at customs... you wouldn't know how your goods will be valued before you're tariffed. You wouldn't know whether you're going to make money or not.”“You'll be confronted when your goods arrive with rules that you were never aware of,” she added.",WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala says the global trading system is at an 'inflection point' She warns that a breakdown of the multilateral trading framework would create widespread uncertainty for businesses.

Rate-cut bets strengthen, bond yields fall

Mixed earnings keep stocks in check

Wall Street stocks traded near record levels on Tuesday as investors digested weak US retail sales data and a mixed set of corporate earnings, boosting expectations that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates later this year.The S&P 500 was marginally higher, briefly sitting just above its all-time high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose around 0.4 per cent to hover near record territory. The Nasdaq Composite also edged up slightly.According to news agency AFP, markets were largely indecisive early in the session as traders balanced concerns about slowing consumer spending with optimism over possible monetary easing.US retail sales data showed no growth in December, missing economists’ expectations and raising concerns about the momentum of the world’s largest economy.Shoppers spent roughly the same in December as in November, signalling potential weakness in household demand, which is the main engine of US economic growth, as per AP.The softer retail data pushed Treasury yields lower, with the benchmark 10-year yield falling to around 4.13 per cent from 4.22 per cent a day earlier, reported news agency AP.Traders also increased bets that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates three times or more this year, according to CME Group data, though most still expect two cuts.The retail sales report comes ahead of key US data releases later this week, including unemployment figures on Wednesday and inflation numbers on Friday. These updates are expected to play a crucial role in shaping the Fed’s interest rate outlook.While stubborn inflation could keep rates higher for longer, signs of labour market weakness may prompt quicker easing.CFRA Research’s Sam Stovall said the data could strengthen the case for additional rate cuts but warned investors must balance this against “the possibility of an economic slowdown”.Corporate earnings offered a mixed picture. Coca-Cola shares slipped after the company reported quarterly revenue growth that fell short of expectations and issued a cautious outlook.S&P Global tumbled after giving a weaker-than-expected profit forecast, amid concerns about competition from AI-driven rivals.In contrast, Hasbro jumped after beating profit and revenue estimates and announcing plans to return up to $1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks.DuPont also gained after posting stronger-than-expected quarterly results and issuing an upbeat profit outlook for 2026.Outside the US, Japan’s Nikkei 225 surged more than 2 per cent to a fresh record, driven by expectations that a newly elected parliament will support tax cuts and pro-growth measures.Other Asian markets saw modest gains, while European indices traded mixed.Overall, markets remained supported by hopes of lower interest rates, even as investors weighed signs of a cooling US economy against resilient corporate performance.","The S&P 500 was marginally higher, briefly sitting just above its all-time high.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy.In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

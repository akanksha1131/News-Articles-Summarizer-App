The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has imposed restrictions on actor Arshad Warsi , his spouse Maria Goretti and 57 other individuals from participating in securities markets for periods ranging from one to five years. This action follows their involvement in deceptive YouTube videos that encouraged share purchases of Sadhna Broadcast.The regulatory body has imposed monetary penalties of Rs 5 lakh each on Warsi and Goretti, alongside a one-year securities market prohibition, according to Sebi's directive issued on Thursday.Additionally, the regulator has imposed financial penalties ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 5 crore on 57 other parties, including the promoters of Sadhna Broadcast (presently known as Crystal Business System Ltd).The regulatory body has instructed all 59 entities to return collective illegal profits of Rs 58.01 crore, with an additional 12 per cent annual interest, to be paid jointly until the complete settlement from the investigation conclusion.According to Sebi's findings, Arshad accumulated profits of Rs 41.70 lakh, whilst his wife gained Rs 50.35 lakh from these activities.The conclusive order identified Gaurav Gupta, Rakesh Kumar Gupta and Manish Mishra as the primary orchestrators of this scheme.The order also revealed that Subhash Aggarwal, a director of SBL's RTA, served as an intermediary between Manish Mishra and the promoters.These people were the key figures who orchestrated and implemented the deceptive plan, according to Sebi.Additionally, Sebi noted that Peeyush Agarwal and Lokesh Shah allowed their controlled accounts to be utilised for the fraudulent strategies of Manish Mishra and SBL's promoters.As a dealer at Choice and owner of the stockbroker's Delhi franchise respectively, they played crucial roles in enabling extensive manipulation of the scrip.Jatin Shah was instrumental in implementing the scheme, whilst other parties either supported the fraudulent activities or participated for quick profits, as stated in the order.According to the 109-page directive, Sebi indicated that the noticees acted as information intermediaries or helped execute manipulative trades, without trading the scrip through their personal accounts.Sebi explained that the organised scheme was carried out in two coordinated stages. Initially, connected and promoter-associated entities conducted trades amongst themselves to gradually increase the scrip price and create artificial market activity.The small-volume transactions had an outsized effect on pricing, primarily due to limited market liquidity. This enabled the involved parties to elevate the share value whilst deploying minimal trading resources.Subsequently, promotional content was broadcast via various YouTube platforms including 'Moneywise', 'The Advisor', and 'Profit Yatra', which were under Manish Mishra's management, as stated in the directive.These video presentations portrayed SBL as an attractive investment prospect and were strategically released to complement and enhance the orchestrated market activities.","Sebi has imposed restrictions on actor Arshad Warsi, his spouse Maria Goretti and 57 other individuals.

According to Bajaj Broking Research, Aurobindo Pharma, and Gokaldas Exports are the top stock picks for today. Here’s its view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for May 30, 2025:

Index View: NIFTY

NIFTY BANK

Bank Nifty continues to consolidate in the broad range of 56,000-53,500 in the last 5 weeks.

A key technical observation on the daily chart is that the index has already taken 26 sessions; it has retraced just 38.2% of the prior 9-session rally (49,157–56,098), indicating a shallow pullback that suggests underlying strength and potential higher bottom formation.

We expect the index to extend the last 5 weeks’ consolidation in the range of 53,500-56,000. Only a move above 56,000 levels will signal acceleration of the up move towards 56,700 levels in the coming sessions.

Within consolidation we believe dips should be used as a buying opportunity. Key support placed at 54,000-53,500 as it is the confluence of the lower band of the last 5 weeks range, key retracement and 50 days EMA.

Stock market recommendations:Benchmark indices extended consolidation for the second week in a row amid stock specific action. Nifty is seen consolidating in the range of 24,400-25,200. Despite facing multiple global macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds — including heightened geopolitical tensions, persistent global trade tariff uncertainties, and elevated U.S. bond yields — the Indian equity market continues to exhibit a resilient upward bias. The benchmark Nifty 50 index has sustained its positive trajectory and is now placed around the 24,800 level.From a short-term technical perspective, the market sentiment remains constructive. The index is expected to find strong demand in the support zone of 24,400–24,500. As long as this key support range is held, we anticipate the Nifty 50 to continue its bullish momentum towards the resistance at 25,200-25,300 levels in the short term.Short-term support for Nifty is placed at 24,400–24,500 levels being confluence of 20 days EMA, previous breakout area and the last 2 weeks lows.While on the higher side 25,200-25,300 remains a key hurdle area being the previous major high and 80% retracement of the entire decline (26.277-21,744).Factors that support the positive momentum in the market 1) Rate cut expectations in the monetary policy outcome (2) Above normal Monsoon Forecast by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) (3) Brent crude prices have remained in a downward trajectory, offering a major tailwind to the Indian economy, which is a net importer of crude.The stock is rebounding taking support at the rising trendline support joining lows of the last 3 months signaling buying demand at lower levels.The daily stochastic is rebounding from the oversold territory and has generated a buy signal moving above its three periods average thus validates positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 1278 levels in the coming months being the 80% retracement of the previous decline (1356-1010) and the high of April 2025.The stock is witnessing buying demand from the previous major breakout area and the confluence of 20- & 50-days EMA signaling strength and offers fresh entry opportunity.It is currently trading above the short- and long-term moving averages signaling strength and overall positive bias.The daily stochastic is rebounding from the oversold territory and has generated a buy signal moving above its three periods average thus validates positive bias. We expect the stock to head towards 1090 levels in the coming months being the 123.6% external retracement of the previous decline (1060-925).","According to Bajaj Broking Research, Aurobindo Pharma, and Gokaldas Exports are the top stock picks for today.

What triggers refund interest, and who pays?

Refund interest isn't a windfall for taxpayers

Interest burden manageable for the government

ITR refund is not dependent on deadline

ITR processing operational challenges

What about other interest provisions?

Final takeaway



NEW DELHI: With the Income Tax Return (ITR) filing deadline for Assessment Year 2025–26 extended from July 31 to September 15, 2025, a key question has surfaced: will this extension increase the government's interest liability on tax refunds?TOI reached out to multiple tax experts to understand the implications of this move on both taxpayers and the exchequer. What emerged is a detailed view of how refund-related interest works under Section 244A of the Income Tax Act, the potential financial burden on the government, and why taxpayers may still be better off filing early.Shalini Jain, Tax Partner, EY India, explained: “The ITR filing extended deadline (for Assessment Year 2025-26, i.e., Financial Year 2024-25) may result in the government paying more interest on tax refunds in certain cases. Considering an example where excess TDS has been deducted from the taxpayer or the taxpayer has paid excess advance tax during the Financial Year (FY), Section 244A(1)(a) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides that the taxpayer will be eligible to receive interest on the refund amount at the rate of 0.5% per month or part of a month calculated from the 1st day of April of the Assessment Year (i.e. , April 1, 2025, for AY 2025-26) up to the date on which the refund is granted.”She further noted that the interest is payable only when the refund exceeds 10% of the assessed tax liability.“Therefore, the extension of due date of filing the tax return from July 31, 2025, to September 15, 2025 may lead to higher interest being paid to taxpayers in eligible cases. Further, the taxpayers should also keep in mind that the interest received on refund is taxable in their hands as ‘income from other sources,’” Jain added.ALSO READ: ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): Deadline to file income tax returns extended from July 31 - check new date Highlighting the administrative side of the extension, Jain also pointed out a practical benefit for the Government“While there may be additional interest liability for the Government, the extended time allows the Government to make their systems ready for additional changes brought about in the income tax returns forms and accurately capture the information from TDS/TCS statements filed by tax deductors/collectors, thereby facilitating a smooth and convenient filing experience for the taxpayers.”Even with the extension, taxpayers are still entitled to receive interest on their tax refunds—provided they file their returns by the new due date of September 15, 2025.“If the Government extends the due date of filing, it would have to pay interest on refunds for the additional time of extension. The Government will need to compensate taxpayers for the extra months that their refunds are delayed,” said Ritika Nayyar, Partner at Singhania & Co., in an exclusive interaction with TOI Online.She added that interest on refunds is calculated at 0.5% per month or part thereof under Section 244A. If the return is filed on or before the due date, interest is calculated from April 1 of the assessment year until the refund is granted.To illustrate how the extended due date could impact pay-outs, Abhishek Soni, CEO and Co-founder of Tax2Win shared a breakdown of refund interest scenarios for returns filed on September 15, 2025, and processed the next day, on September 16, 2025:In another example, if the same return is filed on September 15, 2025, but the refund is processed on October 3, 2025, the interest period extends to 7 months. Here's how that plays out:These scenarios highlight how a longer refund window directly translates into higher interest payouts—an added cost that will be borne by the Income Tax Department.CA Shefali Mundra, Tax Expert at ClearTax, highlighted “If the return is filed on or before the due date u/s 139(1): Interest begins from 1 April of the assessment year till the date of grant of refund.If the return is filed after the due date u/s 139(1): Interest begins from the date of return filing to the date of grant of refund.”She illustrated the interest payable on tax refunds when ITRs are filed on September 15, 2025, with the refunds processed on September 16 and October 3, 2025, respectively.“Interest is payable only if the refund results from excess payment of TDS, TCS or advance tax and is more than 10% of the total tax liability,” Nayyar clarified. “The extra interest due to the extended deadline will be borne by the Government of India, specifically the Income Tax Department.”Despite longer interest accrual periods, delaying returns doesn’t provide major benefits to taxpayers. “There's no significant benefit by delaying to file the tax return since the government pays interest upto 6% per annum, which is almost at par, if not lower, than what banks are paying these days,” said Ankit Jain, Partner at Ved Jain and Associates.Jain pointed out that while filing closer to the deadline might earn you more interest, it’s only marginal.“If one has a refund of Rs 1,00,000 and his return is filed on September 15 with the refund processed on October 3, he gets Rs 3,500 as interest. Had he filed on July 31 and refund issued on August 18, the interest would be Rs 2,000. That’s just Rs 1,500 more—hardly a compelling reason to delay,” he explained.He added that the cost to the government is not heavy because “the coupon rate of Government borrowing is almost at the same rate.”Some tax professionals echoed the view that while the extension increases interest outflow, it’s not alarming. “Extending the ITR filing deadline could lead to the Government incurring extra interest costs under Section 244A on refunds, assuming the average ITR processing time remains consistent with the past two years. However, this additional interest would generally apply only in cases where refunds result from TDS, TCS, or advance tax payments, as interest in such instances accrues from April 1 (of the Assessment Year) until the refund is issued, provided the ITR is filed within the due date. ” said Ashish Karundia, Founder of Ashish Karundia & Co., Chartered Accountants.According to S. Sriram, Partner at Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan Attorneys, refunds are more a function of actual filing and processing than of deadlines.“Granting of a refund is not dependent upon the due date for filing of tax returns but on the actual filing of the return and its processing by the CPC. If the return is filed by July 31, the CPC can process the return earlier and grant the refund quickly,” he told TOI.He warned that filing late—even within the extended deadline—would delay refund processing and result in longer interest periods, which the Government would then have to fund.Even with a push to expedite ITR processing, challenges remain. “To mitigate the potential rise in interest liability, the Government may consider accelerating processing at the CPC,” said Ashish Karundia.He noted that refund timelines also depend on various factors: the complexity of the ITR form, nature of income, taxpayer risk profile, claims made, and cross-verification with third-party data. “Processing times can vary significantly based on these elements,” he said.Aarti Raote, Partner at Deloitte India, brought another dimension into the picture—interest under Sections 234A and 234B. While the extension waives 234A interest (for delayed return filing), taxpayers still remain liable under 234B if they failed to pay sufficient advance tax.“Taxpayers should note that while the tax return filing deadline is extended and hence interest under section 234A for delayed filing will not be triggered if the return is filed by September 15, interest under 234B continues till the date of actual payment if there is default in advance tax,” Raote said.She added that from a government perspective, “delayed processing means delayed scrutiny and delay in the process overall. The Government also pays interest, which starts from the date of filing of the tax return.”However, according to Abhishek Soni, CEO and Co-founder of Tax2Win, ""The extension of the ITR filing deadline from July 31 to September 15, 2025, does not increase the interest paid by the government on tax refunds. Interest continues to be calculated from April 1, 2025, up to the date the refund is issued, provided the return is filed by the extended due date. However, if the return is filed after the deadline, the interest amount may be reduced. ""While the extension provides relief to those needing more time to file, the consensus among tax professionals is clear: taxpayers should aim to file early.“While the ITR filing deadline extension provides taxpayers with additional time to file their returns, it also results in a longer waiting period for refunds. Consequently, eligible taxpayers will accrue more interest on their refunds due to the extended processing time. Taxpayers should file their returns promptly once filing is live to expedite the refund process.” said CA Shefali Mundra, Tax Expert, ClearTax.",Extended ITR deadline may lead to higher refund interest. Interest still payable if returns filed by extended deadline. How much more interest could be paid? How long will it take to process the returns?

NEW DELHI: In a relief to Vedanta, the appellate tribunal NCLAT has stayed the National Company Law Tribunal orders against the demerger of the multinational mining company into separate entities and subsequent listing.The Mumbai bench of NCLT had on March 4 rejected the first motion petition moved for the composite scheme of arrangement between Vedanta in the matter of Talwandi Sabo Power (TSPL), observing that material facts have not been disclosed regarding its debt obligations, which was against the Companies Act. This was immediately challenged before the NCLAT, which earlier this week stayed the order passed by the NCLT bench till its next hearing, scheduled on Aug 4, 2025.The appellate tribunal said: ""Issues raised before us need to be considered at length and presently in view of the submissions made the scheme is severable and thus in case the stay is not granted to the impugned order it may affect the second motion application filed in respect of other three transferor companies pending in different tribunals.""A two-member NCLAT bench also agreed to the proposal of submission of a bank guarantee of Rs 1,245 crore claimed by its creditor Sepco Electric Power Construction Corporation, without prejudice to their rights.The first motion application is usually filed before the NCLT by the transferor and transferee companies. The second motion then follows after the first motion is granted, allowing for the court to fully evaluate the scheme. agencies",The appellate tribunal NCLAT has stayed the National Company Law Tribunal orders against the demerger of the multinational mining company.

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said India is sustaining its GDP growth momentum as the fastest-growing economy for the fourth year in a row, aided by manufacturing, services, and farm sectors.""India is sustaining growth and it is the fastest-growing economy now for the fourth year continuously, thanks to the work of small, medium, and large industries; industries which are coming in and making sure our manufacturing capacity, our service capacity are all intact.

Declining crude oil prices will potentially lower import bills, create fiscal space, and alleviate external economic pressures,"" he said in a presentation.Sitharaman said govt is constantly working to remove regulatory difficulties and bring soft-touch regulation, which will allow people to do business without suspicion.

MUMBAI: Sebi on Friday banned 59 entities, including actor Arshad Warsi , his wife Maria Goretti, from the market for up to 5 years. The move is related to misleading videos on YouTube channels - like Moneywise, The Advisor and Profit Yatra - luring investors to buy TV channel Sadhna Broadcast's shares. The markets regulator fined the couple Rs 10 lakh, and they will have to disgorge illegal gains worth Rs 92 lakh from the stock price manipulation.Warsi and his wife Goretti played a role in promoting the stock of Sadhna (now Crystal Business System) through videos on YouTube, which were uploaded by one of the masterminds of the scheme.In its 109-page order, Sebi whole-time member Ashwani Bhatia stated that the way the whole incident played out painted ""a disturbing picture regarding the increasing use of social media platforms, which have immense reach and influence in the digital age, as tools for market manipulation"". Sebi ordered disgorgement of illegal gains totalling about Rs 58 crore and imposed fines of up to Rs 5 crore on the entities. The overall conduct of the people involved in the scheme revealed a classic pump-and-dump scheme, the report said.""The price was systematically pushed upward through collusive trading, followed by aggressive promotional activity to draw in retail investors, and finally, a coordinated sell-off by the promoters.Retail investors, misled by this staged market activity, were left holding the shares at distorted valuations once the manipulators, including the promoters, exited,"" the report said.Sebi found that three individuals, Gaurav Gupta, Rakesh Kumar Gupta, and Manish Mishra, were the masterminds. Subhash Aggarwal, a director with Skyline Financial Services, the registrar & transfer agent of Sadhna Broadcast, was the middleman. These individuals ""were the central characters who planned and executed the manipulative scheme"", Sebi said.Modus Operandi: First, the entities executed trades among themselves to steadily inflate the price of the scrip and create a false appearance of market interest.

Struggling Vodafone Idea has come to govt time and again for support. How long can you give this long rope to the company?

How long can you wait for a turnaround? At least some bit of accountability is needed because this is public money going into saving a company...

Are you in regular touch with them?

Trai has given its recommendations On satellite communications. When will DoT approve them?

Any healthy market has a mix of local and global players. Elon Musk is coming with Starlink and Amazon wants to come with Project Kuiper. Do you think it's good to have global competition?

Communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said government has no plans to provide any relief on the AGR (adjusted gross revenue) front to telecom companies after the Supreme Court struck down their plea for a waiver of interest and penalty. In an interview with TOI, the minister also made it clear that beleaguered Vodafone Idea will not receive any further equity conversion from government beyond the current 49%, and it's now the company's responsibility to take care of profit and loss and the balance sheet. Excerpts:Every company has to chart its own path. Profit and loss and the balance sheet are the responsibility of the management of each company - be it BSNL, Vodafone Idea, Jio, or Airtel. Based on govt policy, we converted close to Rs 36,000 crore of Vodafone Idea's dues into equity. We are today at 49%. I do not see us increasing that equity stake in the near future, at all. It's the responsibility of each company.They have to define their own path at end of the day. That's the job of CEO of Vodafone Idea.I don't believe in meddling in a company's affairs, whether it be a PSU or where govt has a stake. But if and when they come to us, we certainly meet them and hear them out.There's nothing on my table at this point, so I can't comment. I think the Supreme Court has ruled on the matter, and that's where it stands.We will start processing it. The department will look at it and then take a call.I can't give you a very definitive timeline, but I can assure you that we are trying to do this sooner rather than later.I can only say my market is open for you.

MUMBAI: RBI is looking to introduce interest rate rules for non-banking finance companies similar to those that govern banks. The goal is to improve how changes in monetary policy pass through to borrowers and to make loan pricing more transparent.As of now, when RBI changes its benchmark repo rate, banks pass on the changes quickly to borrowers with floating-rate loans. However, NBFCs, including housing finance firms, adjust more slowly or in ways that are less transparent. ""The extant regulations on interest rates on advances vary across all regulated entities,"" said RBI. ""In order to harmonise the same, a comprehensive review of the extant regulatory instructions is underway. ""RBI has been consulting internally and with key industry stakeholders about how to standardise interest rate frameworks. ""In order to solicit wider public feedback, it is proposed to issue a discussion paper delineating the various imperatives of moving to a harmonised regime for interest rates on loans and advances across all regulated entities,"" the central bank said in its annual report.Analysts say the current system creates gaps in oversight.""Banks have repo rate-linked loans, MCLR (marginal cost of lending rate) loans, etc, which are all well defined and RBI can track how transmission happens,"" said Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie. ""NBFCs don't have these repo-linked or MCLR loans and they price their loans off some antiquated PLR (prime lending rate) concept. Of course, eventual end-pricing will be determined by competitive forces. Having said that, this entire process is super opaque and hence it is essential a proper alignment is sought,"" Ganapathy added.RBI also wants to overhaul how it supervises NBFCs broadly. One change involves reviewing its risk-based approach to monitoring compliance with anti-money laundering rules. It will examine whether KYC framework is being applied effectively, especially for higher-risk firms.The regulator also plans a thematic review to ensure NBFCs follow interest rate guidelines, particularly to prevent customers from being charged excessive rates. At the same time, it is studying how to bring more NBFCs under a risk-based supervision model, where regulatory attention depends on the complexity and risk profile of each firm. RBI also plans to simplify rules for borrowing and lending in rupees, and to streamline the process by which companies are authorised to handle foreign currency under India's foreign exchange law.","RBI is looking to introduce interest rate rules for non-banking finance companies similar to those that govern banks.

NEW DELHI: India's economy grew faster than expected at 7.4% in the Jan-March quarter, led by robust growth in agriculture and construction. The strong quarterly showing - the fastest in the fiscal year - pushed overall growth in 2024-25 to 6.5%, according to data released by the National Statistics Office.The Jan-March figure outperformed the upwardly revised 6.4% in the Oct-Dec period, and pointed to robust momentum in the fourth quarter amid global uncertainty. India remained the fastest growing major economy in the March quarter, followed by China at 5.4% and Indonesia at 4.9%. The full-year growth estimate was in line with expectations and the second advance estimate, but the lowest in 4 years, on the back of 9.2% expansion in the previous year.Chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran Friday said robust domestic demand has supported GDP growth and private consumption share has risen to the highest level since FY04. ""Govt retains its outlook on FY26 growth at 6.3-6.8%, with private consumption, especially the rural rebound, and resilient services exports as the key drivers,"" Nageswaran said in a presentation after the data was released. Multiple agencies project India's growth to be in the range of 6.3-6.7% this year, he said.The Jan-Mar quarter data showed the farm sector remaining robust with growth of 5.4% while the construction sector grew 10.8% in the same period. The services sector remained steady at 7.3% in the March quarter compared with an expansion of 7.8% in the same year earlier quarter.The 6.5% growth for 2024-25 was attributed to a pickup in private consumption and investment while the acceleration in investment demand led to the sharp jump in the fourth quarter performance.""In line with expectations, real GDP registered 6.5% growth in fiscal 2025, elevating the Indian economy's size to $3.9 trillion from $3.6 trillion in fiscal 2024,"" said DK Joshi, chief economist at ratings agency Crisil. ""Consumption growth outpaced GDP, primarily driven by robust rural demand supported by a strong agricultural sector. A sharp catchup in investment growth in the last quarter also brought investment growth above GDP growth. ...

Donald Trump announces 50% tariff on steel imports from June 4 to 'secure industry in US',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-announces-50-tariff-on-steel-imports-to-secure-industry-in-us/articleshow/121526245.cms,"US President Donald Trump speaks at US Steel Corporation's Mon Valley Works-Irvin plant, Friday, May 30, 2025, in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania (AP Photo)

US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he is doubling the tariff on steel imports to 50 percent, a big increase that could raise prices for steel, which is used in housing, cars, and other products.""We're going to bring it from 25 per cent to 50 per cent, the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry,"" Trump said.Trump said he had a ""major announcement"" as he spoke at US Steel’s Mon Valley Works–Irvin Plant in West Mifflin, US state of Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh, to talk about investments by Japan’s Nippon Steel.""Nobody's going to get around that,"" he added during the speech in front of workers in a state that helped him win the 2016 election.Trump said US Steel will remain an American company under a deal where Japan-based Nippon Steel will invest in the company. Few details about the deal have been shared.""We’re here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,"" Trump said at an event in one of US Steel's warehouses near Pittsburgh. ""You're going to stay an American company, you know that, right?""He said doubling the tariffs on steel imports ""will even further secure the steel industry in the US.""But this large increase could cause prices to rise more.Trump later posted on social media that the higher tariff rate would take effect on June 4.""It is my great honor to raise the Tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%, effective Wednesday, June 4th. Our steel and aluminum industries are coming back like never before. This will be yet another BIG jolt of great news for our wonderful steel and aluminum workers. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.Workers, Trump supporters, local officials, and others gathered in a large warehouse at the Irvin plant to hear Trump speak. American flags hung from the ceiling, and a sign read ""The Golden Age."" Steelworkers wore orange hard hats and work clothes, and large coils of steel made at the plant filled part of the warehouse floor. The steel is used for appliances, doors, and other products.At first, Trump promised to block the Japanese company’s attempt to buy US Steel, but last week he announced a deal for Nippon Steel to have ""partial ownership."" It is not clear if the deal is finalized or how the ownership will be arranged.Trump said he considered a 40 per cent tariff, but industry leaders asked for 50 per cent.""At 25 per cent they can sorta get over that fence,"" Trump said. ""At 50 per cent nobody’s getting over that fence.""On March 12, Trump imposed 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. This led to immediate retaliation from Canada and complaints from the US auto industry. The European Union also responded with tariffs but later removed them.During his speech on Friday, President Donald Trump also spoke about the agreement he approved, allowing Japan’s Nippon Steel to acquire a controlling stake in US Steel.Earlier, during his presidential campaign, Trump had opposed the idea of US Steel being sold to a foreign company. At the time, it was one of the few issues he agreed on with President Joe Biden, who had blocked the deal, calling it a threat to national security.On Friday, however, Trump said he eventually supported the deal after being convinced that Nippon Steel could help preserve US Steel and protect its workers.""US Steel was being sold into foreign hands with no protections for our great steel workers,"" Trump said. ""And I said there’s no way we’re gonna let that happen. I was watching over you.""Trump said that executives from Nippon and US Steel continued to meet with him to discuss the sale, and he kept turning it down until the proposal included better terms. A major reason he accepted the revised deal, he said, was the inclusion of a so-called golden share, which gives the US government a say in how the company operates.""They kept asking me and I kept rejecting them: No way, no way, no way,"" Trump said. ""Every time they came in, the deal got better and better and better for the workers.""""I’m going to be in Washington; I’m gonna be watching over it,"" Trump added.With the increase in steel tariffs and the finalized Nippon deal, Trump said that workers at US Steel now had reasons to feel hopeful. He invited several workers on stage who shared concerns about the decline of the American steel industry and thanked Trump for his actions.""This is going to be a very big day,"" Trump said. ""This is going to be one of the biggest days in your life.""","US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he is doubling the tariff on steel imports to 50 percent.

Tit-for-tat tariffs: It’s been a bumpy road

So, what went wrong between the US & China this time?

US President Donald Trump claims he was a ‘Nice Guy’ with China - that he helped China out of a ‘devastating’ situation when the world’s second largest economy was in ‘grave economic danger’. But, China ‘violated’ its agreement with the US, Trump has said in his latest social media post on the Truth Social. Trump’s latest salvo against China comes as no surprise for experts, who have come to accept Trump’s ‘flip-flops’ as a reality.Two weeks ago, the US and China announced reaching an agreement for a temporary 90-day reduction in their tariffs, following discussions between senior officials in Geneva. The United States decided to temporarily decrease its additional tariffs on Chinese goods from 145 percent to 30 percent. In response, Beijing implemented a corresponding reduction, bringing down its additional tariffs from 125 percent to 10 percent.US tariffs continue to be elevated, incorporating a 20 percent duty that the Trump administration recently applied to Chinese products, citing concerns about Beijing's supposed involvement in illegal drug trafficking - an allegation that China has firmly disputed.But things seem to have gone down hill again since then.Trump’s social post reads, “Two weeks ago China was in grave economic danger! The very high Tariffs I set made it virtually impossible for China to TRADE into the United States marketplace which is, by far, number one in the World. We went, in effect, COLD TURKEY with China, and it was devastating for them. Many factories closed and there was, to put it mildly, “civil unrest. ” I saw what was happening and didn’t like it, for them, not for us. I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!”Trump has always called China the ‘biggest abuser’ on tariffs. On April 2, also called the ‘Liberation Day’ by Trump, the US President announced sweeping tariffs on most major economies, with China getting hit with 34% tariffs (plus 20% existing tariff). China had retaliated strongly by raising its own tariffs and the situation had quickly escalated to a level where Trump eventually imposed 245% reciprocal tariffs on China.Also Read | Big embarrassment!

In the past Trump administration officials have said that China is wielding its market supremacy as a strategic tool, necessitating immediate US action.Global markets went into a tailspin following the trade war between the US and China and the 90-day truce between the world’s two largest economies had brought a sense of relief - albeit fragile!Trump's statement lacks details regarding China's specific violations of the Geneva, Switzerland agreement and does not outline his intended response towards Beijing.A US official informed Reuters that China appeared to be delaying the issuance of export licences for rare earth minerals.US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC that China had not fulfilled its Geneva commitments. He said, ""The Chinese are slow-rolling their compliance, which is completely unacceptable and it has to be addressed.""Greer indicated that China's supply of critical minerals, previously stopped due to Chinese trade countermeasures, had not resumed as stipulated in the Geneva agreement.Earlier, in a Fox News interview, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessen had t indicated that negotiations with China regarding trade matters were ""a bit stalled.""Also Read | ‘Overstepped his authority…’: What are the scathing observations made by US trade court in ruling against Donald Trump’s tariffs?

A recent US trade court verdict said that the president exceeded his authority by invoking emergency economic powers to warrant comprehensive tariffs.The court's decision halted the most extensive duties since Trump's return to office, though the ruling remains suspended pending an appeal process.Nevertheless, the verdict maintains the existing tariffs that the Trump administration had established on specific industry imports, including steel and automotive sectors.Also Read | ‘Even if we lose…’: Donald Trump administration readying two-part strategy to impose reciprocal tariffs, says ‘we will do it another way’","US President Donald Trump claims he was a 'Nice Guy' with China - that he helped China out of a ‘devastating’ situation.

Tariff pressures still loom over summer outlook after softening US inflation in April,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tariff-pressures-still-loom-over-summer-outlook-after-softening-us-inflation-in-april/articleshow/121519332.cms,"The US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge eased more than expected in April, offering a temporary reprieve from price pressures even as new tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump began to take effect.According to data released Friday by the Commerce Department, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.1% year-over-year, down from a revised 2.3% in March. The figure came in slightly below the 2.2% median forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, keeping overall inflation just above the Fed’s 2% long-term target, AFP reported.On a monthly basis, headline inflation edged up 0.1%, mirroring the increase in the “core” PCE index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. Core inflation rose 2.5% from a year earlier, just under the 2.6% economists had projected.“We're seeing evidence that we were on track for a perfect landing when it comes to inflation,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, speaking to AFP. “But that unfortunately came before the tariff storm that is likely to lead to an inflationary acceleration over the course of the summer.”The April price gains were largely driven by a 0.5% increase in prices for durable goods and energy, which was partially offset by a 0.3% decline in food prices.Trump’s newly imposed tariffs, dubbed “liberation day” duties, took effect on April 2, with a 10% levy applied to most countries and even higher rates imposed on key trading partners shortly thereafter. Though some of the measures have since been paused, legal battles are ongoing.This week, the US Court of International Trade ruled Trump exceeded his legal authority, only for a federal judge to grant a temporary stay, allowing the tariffs to remain in place during the appeal.While it's too early for these tariffs to be fully reflected in the data, Daco noted early signs of upward pressure, pointing out that furniture prices began climbing in April following the new duties. “That bodes poorly for the inflation outlook over the coming months,” he warned, suggesting that rising prices could begin to erode consumer spending.The Trump administration maintains that the tariffs will help reduce trade imbalances and won’t harm the broader economy, though many economists expect higher consumer prices and a slowdown in growth — at least in the short term.In more positive economic news, personal income rose 0.8% in April, significantly ahead of the 0.3% forecast. Additionally, the personal saving rate jumped to 4.9% from a revised 4.3% in March, indicating that consumers are holding onto more of their disposable income.For the Federal Reserve, Friday’s data may offer temporary relief. The central bank has kept interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, and officials continue to deliberate over the timing of future rate cuts.Still, the outlook remains uncertain. Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, cautioned that the current cooling in inflation may not last. “Inflation will likely reaccelerate for the remainder of 2025 as both supply and demand pressures will push annual inflation rates higher,” he wrote in a note shared with AFP.","In April, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.1% year-over-year, down from a revised 2.3% in March.

Despite the day’s dip, the market remained on track to close out what could be its best month since November 2023.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% in morning trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 13 points, or less than 0.1%, as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%.Shares of Gap Inc. dragged on the market, plunging 21.1%, even after the retailer reported better-than-expected profit and revenue. The company, which owns Banana Republic and Old Navy, warned that tariffs on imports from China and other nations could add up to $300 million in costs this fiscal year. While Gap has plans to mitigate about half of that impact, the warning spooked investors.Markets have spent much of the week reacting to the latest developments in the White House’s tariff policy. Earlier optimism that Trump’s tariffs might be easing helped fuel a rally, especially after a U.S.court blocked many of the levies on Wednesday. That helped push the S&P 500 toward its first winning month in four and potentially its strongest since late 2023.However, the situation remains uncertain. The White House is appealing the U.S. Court of International Trade’s ruling, keeping many of the tariffs in place for now. Tensions flared again Friday morning after Trump accused China of failing to uphold its end of the tariff pause agreement. “So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!” he posted on Truth Social.The comments briefly rattled markets, but futures soon stabilized. Many analysts believe Trump may seek alternative legal routes to continue applying tariff pressure.Trump argues that tariffs are essential to revitalizing American manufacturing, even if households and businesses feel short-term pain. The uncertain outlook has already prompted some companies to pull back. American Eagle Outfitters, for example, withdrew its financial forecast for 2025, citing economic ambiguity. Its stock fell 1.4% after it reported a steeper-than-expected quarterly loss.On the upside, Ulta Beauty shares surged 14.8% after reporting strong sales and raising its full-year revenue outlook, despite describing the business climate as “fluid.” Costco also edged higher, climbing 3.7%, after beating earnings expectations.Red Robin Gourmet Burgers rocketed 69% after surprising investors with a quarterly profit, while SharpLink Gaming extended its meteoric rally, rising 19.5% on Friday to bring its weekly gain to 1,308%. The marketing company, which connects consumers to sportsbooks and casino platforms, announced a $425 million plan to invest in Ethereum-based cryptocurrency ventures.Meanwhile, bond markets were calm. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.40% from 4.43%, while the two-year yield held steady at 3.92%, reflecting investor expectations that the Federal Reserve may hold rates steady for a while longer.A separate report from the University of Michigan showed that consumer sentiment improved slightly in May, especially after Trump paused many of his proposed tariffs on China. Still, Americans remain anxious. “Overall, consumers see the outlook for the economy as no worse than last month, but they remained quite worried about the future,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the Survey of Consumers.The Fed has so far held its benchmark borrowing rate steady in 2025 after a round of cuts late last year. Officials have indicated they want more time to assess the inflationary impact of tariffs before making further decisions.Global markets showed mixed movement. In Europe, France’s CAC 40 rose 0.3%, Germany’s DAX climbed 0.8%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 added 0.6%.In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.2% to 37,965.10 after inflation data from Tokyo showed core prices rising faster than expected, fueling speculation that the Bank of Japan may raise interest rates.Australia’s ASX 200 gained 0.3%, while South Korea’s Kospi slipped 0.8% ahead of next week’s presidential election. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 1.2% and China’s Shanghai Composite shed 0.5%.The trade court’s ruling applies only to some tariffs, leaving those on steel, aluminum, and automobiles—enacted under a different law—unaffected. On Thursday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit allowed the president to continue collecting the contested tariffs temporarily while the case proceeds.In energy markets, US crude dipped 7 cents to $60.87 per barrel, while Brent crude fell 10 cents to $63.25. In currency trading, the US dollar weakened to 143.68 yen from 144.12 yen, and the euro edged down to $1.1344 from $1.1367.","The S&P 500 slipped 0.2% in morning trading.

A key US inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices, while American incomes jumped.Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1 per cent in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3 per cent in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5 per cent from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.6 per cent. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court.The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared to their target of 2 per cent. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump's tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries.Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars were implemented under different laws and remain in place.But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.","Consumer prices rose just 2.1 per cent in April compared with a year earlier.

Asian stock markets slipped on Friday after a court ruling in the United States that gave president Donald Trump’s tariff policies a temporary reprieve. The stocks had improved the previous day when a lower court had termed them unconstitutional.The Nikkei in Tokyo and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 1.4% on Friday, while Shanghai’s Composite Index slipped 0.5%. Sydney and Seoul also fell, though markets in Wellington and Manila showed modest gains. The yen gained strength after inflation data from Tokyo came in higher than expected, increasing the likelihood of an interest rate hike by the central bank in July.The decline in Asian equities comes after Wall Street ended flat, with slight gains across the Dow and other main indexes. Weak US economic data, including a revised GDP contraction in early 2025 and disappointing jobless and housing numbers, added to the cautious mood.The legal tug-of-war over Trump’s tariffs is now expected to reach the Supreme Court. A federal judge had earlier ruled that the administration exceeded its authority in imposing the levies, a judgment Trump called “horrible” and urged to be overturned. ""Backroom 'hustlers' must not be allowed to destroy our nation!,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.A separate ruling by a federal district judge in Washington, DC also declared some of the tariffs unlawful, giving the administration 14 days to file an appeal.Despite the legal blocks, Trump allies insist that the administration will continue pushing its trade agenda. AFP quoted economists like Rodrigo Catril of National Australia Bank, warning that the fight only adds another layer of uncertainty. ""The only thing that looks more certain is more uncertainty, which is set to lead to a further pullback in investment decision and hiring,"" said Cartil.","The Nikkei in Tokyo and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 1.4% on Friday.

Security benefits on the Rise

Compensation for CEOs at S&P 500 companies jumped nearly 10% in 2024, as stock prices surged and corporate profits swelled, continuing a trend of widening pay gaps between executives and average employees.According to data analyzed for The Associated Press by Equilar, the typical pay package for S&P 500 CEOs who served at least two full consecutive fiscal years rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7% from the previous year. In contrast, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419 — a 1.7% increase year over year, AP reported.The AP’s annual survey includes data from 344 executives who filed proxy statements between January 1 and April 30.Despite economic concerns such as lingering inflation and elevated interest rates, the stock market soared in 2024. The S&P 500 gained more than 23%, while corporate profits rose over 9%, driving up performance-based compensation. Many companies have shifted CEO pay toward stock-based awards, which are often conditional on future targets like share price increases or improved profitability.“2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,” said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.Rick Smith, CEO of Axon Enterprises, led the list with a $164.5 million pay package. Nearly all of it consisted of stock awards tied to future performance through 2030. Axon, the maker of Tasers and body cameras, posted a record $377 million in net income and saw its shares more than double last year.Other high earners included:Most of these packages were heavily weighted toward stock and options. According to Equilar, the median value of stock awards climbed nearly 15%, while base salaries grew by only 4%.“For CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,"" said Melissa Burek, another partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. ""Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.”Jackie Cook of Morningstar Sustainalytics noted that linking CEO pay to stock performance may reflect shareholder priorities but warned it has “led to a ‘phenomenal rise’ in CEO compensation ‘tracking recent years' market performance,’ which has ‘widened the pay gap within workplaces.’”Some well-known CEOs were excluded from the rankings due to the survey's eligibility criteria. For instance, Starbucks’ Brian Niccol, whose 2024 compensation was valued at $95.8 million, only became CEO in September. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s $49.9 million package was not included as the company filed its proxy after the survey's deadline.Warren Buffett, known for his modest salary, was listed at $405,000—about five times the median worker's pay at Berkshire Hathaway. Tesla’s Elon Musk reported no compensation for 2024, although his 2018 stock package worth up to $56 billion remains under court review.The median CEO earned 192 times what the median worker at their company made. In some industries, the disparity is even more striking. Carnival Corp. reported a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of nearly 1,300:1, and McDonald's was close behind with a 1,000:1 gap.Private-sector wages rose 3.6% in 2024, with the average U.S. worker earning $65,460 annually, or $92,000 including benefits.“With CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,” said Sarah Anderson, director of the Global Economy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies. ""These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value – they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates. ”The number of women on the list rose to 27, the highest since 2014. Their median compensation was $20 million — a 10.7% rise compared to 9.7% for male CEOs, who earned a median of $16.8 million.Top-earning female CEOs included:“There are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we’re really not moving the needle significantly,” said Christy Glass, a sociology professor at Utah State University. She cited the broader slowdown in corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts.Equilar found companies are increasingly offering security-related perks as part of executive compensation, possibly influenced by incidents such as the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.Among 208 companies reviewed, median spending on executive security rose from $69,180 in 2023 to $94,276 in 2024. Notable increases came from companies like Centene and Intel.","The median CEO earned 192 times what the median worker at their company made.

Trump Responds To ‘TACO Trade’ Jab & 'Trump Always Chickens Out' Acronym In High-Drama WH Presser

What happens to Trump’s tariffs now?

What will be the impact on trade deal talks with India, China & others?

Importantly, key trade partners, including China, India, the European Union, and Japan, currently engaged in discussions with the Trump administration, face a strategic choice. They must evaluate whether to continue pursuing trade deals actively or adopt a measured approach to negotiations, given their potentially strengthened position following this development.

What the Trump administration may do

US President Donald Trump ’s reciprocal tariffs strategy to negotiate trade deals favouring America has been thrown into complete turmoil by a US trade court ruling. The US court has issued a rare rebuke to Trump, striking down tariffs that his administration sought to levy and enforce on various countries.The judicial panel, comprising three judges, determined that Trump overstepped his presidential powers in utilising the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency as justification for the broad-ranging tariffs.These tariffs represented a departure from long-standing American trade practices, causing substantial disruption to international trade flows, instability in financial markets, and increased the likelihood of inflation and economic downturn both domestically and internationally.The judicial ruling prevents the implementation of tariffs that Trump imposed in April on nearly all trading partners of the United States, along with the duties he had earlier enforced on China, Mexico and Canada.However, the court's decision maintains other Trump-era tariffs, specifically those affecting foreign steel, aluminium and automobiles. These particular duties were enacted under separate legislation that necessitated a Commerce Department investigation and could not be implemented solely based on presidential discretion.Also Read | ‘Overstepped his authority…’: What are the scathing observations made by US trade court in ruling against Donald Trump’s tariffs? The implementation timeline for the court ruling remains uncertain, with authorities having a 10-day window to execute administrative procedures for tariff removal.Upon enforcement, the ruling would swiftly eliminate the newly imposed 30% US tariffs on Chinese imports, 25% duties on Canadian and Mexican goods, and 10% levies on most other international imports entering the US.Whilst financial markets responded positively to potential tariff relief, questions remain about the lasting impact of this ruling on Trump's international trade agenda.Evaluating the ruling's effect on India-US trade deal negotiations, Ajay Srivastava, GTRI's founder, emphasised that India must stand firm against any agreements influenced by threats or founded on illegal measures.Srivastava pointed out that the tariffs implemented during Trump's presidency contravene both WTO regulations and US domestic legislation, as per the federal court's decision.""With the Trump tariffs standing on shaky legal ground, India must pause and reassess its negotiation strategy before committing to an FTA that could disproportionately favour U.S. interests,"" said Srivastava in a statement.Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said during a Thursday morning press conference in Tokyo that the administration will ""thoroughly examine the content of the ruling and its implications and respond appropriately.""Also Read | ‘Sergey Brins of the world came as students..’: Raghuram Rajan warns about risks to US economy if foreign students are curbed by Trump The Australian Trade and Tourism Minister Don Farrell indicated that his government remains committed to pursuing discussions and actively seeking the elimination of what he termed as ""unjustified"" tariffs.A Georgetown Law School professor and former WTO judge, Jennifer Hillman, questioned the logic of negotiating over tariffs that have been deemed unlawful. ""I don't know why any country would want to engage in negotiations to get out of tariffs that have now been declared illegal,"" she told Bloomberg. ""It's a very definitive decision that the reciprocal worldwide tariffs are simply illegal.""Hillman emphasised that the court's ruling specifically addressed the improper use of tariffs as a negotiating tool. ""What the court is saying is creating leverage is not a legitimate use of tariffs,"" she explained. ""To me it's a very, very important decision.""Wendy Cutler, who previously served as a US trade official and currently holds the position of vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, indicates that the court's ruling has created significant uncertainty in the president's trade strategy.She told the Associated Press that during the 90-day tariff suspension period, negotiating partners might be reluctant to offer additional concessions to the US whilst awaiting clearer legal direction.Additionally, businesses will need to review their supply chain operations, potentially accelerating their US-bound deliveries to mitigate possible risks should the tariffs be restored following an appeal.Also Read | Remittances tax: How Donald Trump's 'The One Big Beautiful Bill’ may turn out to be ugly for Indians in the US The court's decision highlighted that Trump maintains authority under the Trade Act of 1974 to implement tariffs for addressing trade imbalances. However, this legislation limits tariff rates to 15% and allows implementation for only 150 days with nations where the US experiences significant trade deficits.Legal specialists, including Hillman, acknowledge that Trump maintains access to alternative legal mechanisms. However, none of these options provide the extensive authority available under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) that Trump previously utilised.Critics have pointed out the administration's previous resistance to judicial decisions, and Trump's supporters have questioned judicial impartiality, raising concerns about compliance with this latest court order.Trump retains the ability to implement sector-specific or country-targeted tariffs, similar to his previous term's actions. Recently, he utilised national security provisions to enforce duties on foreign steel, aluminium and automobiles, whilst initiating seven additional investigations covering pharmaceuticals, lumber, critical minerals and other sectors.""The Trump administration's toolbox won't be completely empty,"" Dmitry Grozoubinski, director of ExplainTrade and author of the book ""Why Politicians Lie About Trade"" said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. But as for IEEPA, ""if they comply with this ruling that takes that toy out of the toy box.""A spokesperson from the White House has rejected the court ruling, stating it was made by 'unelected judges' who shouldn't possess authority 'to decide how to properly address a national emergency'.""Foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment of the United States has fueled America's historic and persistent trade deficits,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. ""These deficits have created a national emergency that has decimated American communities, left our workers behind, and weakened our defense industrial base – facts that the court did not dispute.""Also Read | Big export boom: India benefits from Donald Trump’s tariffs; Indian firms see competitive position in the US tariff scenario","US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs strategy to negotiate trade deals favouring America has been thrown into complete turmoil by a US trade court ruling.

The Commerce Department released the revised estimate Thursday, slightly improving on its initial figure.The drop in gross domestic product (GDP) — the broadest measure of economic output — follows a 2.4% gain in the fourth quarter of 2024. The contraction was primarily driven by a sharp increase in imports as companies rushed to stockpile foreign goods ahead of Trump’s sweeping tariff hikes, AP reported.“First-quarter growth was brought down by a surge in imports as companies in the United States hurried to bring in foreign goods before the president imposed massive import taxes,” the report said.Imports surged at a 42.6% pace, the fastest since the third quarter of 2020, subtracting more than five percentage points from GDP growth. At the same time, consumer spending slowed considerably, while federal government spending fell at a 4.6% annual rate — the steepest decline in three years.Although trade deficits mathematically subtract from GDP, the effect is largely accounting-based. GDP only includes domestic production, so imports — even if counted as consumer spending — must be excluded to avoid overstating domestic economic activity.The import spike is seen as temporary and may not weigh on GDP in the April–June quarter.Despite the headline contraction, business investment surged 24.4% during the quarter. A buildup in inventories, as firms stocked up in anticipation of tariffs, contributed more than 2.6 percentage points to GDP.A measure of core economic strength — which excludes trade, inventories, and government spending — rose at a solid 2.5% annual rate in Q1, down slightly from 2.9% in the previous quarter.Trump’s broad tariff regime has created added uncertainty for the economic outlook. He has imposed 10% levies on nearly all US trade partners, in addition to targeted tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles.On Wednesday, a US federal court blocked the 10% tariffs along with duties on specific imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, ruling that the president had exceeded his legal authority.Thursday’s release was the second of three estimates of first-quarter GDP.

The White House immediately appealed the decision, and it remains unclear whether the administration will comply during the legal process.“The ruling was, at the least, ‘a brief respite before the next thunderclap,’” said Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management. “Just when traders thought they’d seen every twist in the tariff saga, the gavel dropped like a lightning bolt over the Pacific.”Despite the uncertainty over future appeals, investors were encouraged by the prospect of easing trade tensions.

Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices gained 3.1 per cent each, Super Micro Computer jumped 4 per cent, and Apple and Amazon rose about 2.5 per cent.Nvidia, a leading chipmaker and AI giant, has faced sharp swings due to the tariff dispute, which had largely neutralized its stock price gains earlier this year.In Europe, Germany’s DAX gained 0.4 per cent, France’s CAC 40 jumped 0.8 per cent, and the UK’s FTSE 100 was flat at midday.Elsewhere in Asia, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.2 per cent to 8,409.80.

Markets Cheer As Federal Court Strikes Down Trump’s Global Tariffs In Unanimous Ruling

US President Donald Trump’s tariffs being struck down by a US trade court should make India tread with caution on a potential trade deal, says the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). The GTRI has advised India to exercise prudence in its current Free Trade Agreement (FTA) discussions with the United States.On May 28, a federal court in Manhattan deemed invalid Trump's initiative to levy reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners, establishing that such tariff impositions require Congressional approval rather than presidential emergency powers.The court's verdict explicitly stated that tariffs, including those enacted under emergency economic authority, were not legally valid.According to an ANI report, GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava, whilst evaluating the ruling's implications on trade discussions, has emphasised that India should not accept any arrangements influenced by threats or founded on illegal measures.Also Read | ‘Overstepped his authority…’: What are the scathing observations made by US trade court in ruling against Donald Trump’s tariffs? Srivastava noted that the tariffs from Trump's administration contravene both World Trade Organisation (WTO) regulations and US domestic legislation, as confirmed by the federal court ruling.""With the Trump tariffs standing on shaky legal ground, India must pause and reassess its negotiation strategy before committing to an FTA that could disproportionately favour U.S. interests,"" said Srivastava in a statement.India and the United States are set to finalise the initial phase of the anticipated Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) prior to July.The trade agreement between India and the US would represent a crucial development in the economic partnership between these major economies, creating potential opportunities for trade and investment collaboration.The United States maintained its position as India's primary trading partner for the fourth successive year in 2024-25, with trade between the nations reaching USD 131.84 billion. During this period, India recorded a goods trade surplus of USD 41.18 billion with the US.Following the US federal court's significant decision, global stock markets responded favourably, particularly in prominent Asian markets.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart.

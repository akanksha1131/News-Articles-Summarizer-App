Gold price prediction today: US President Donald Trump’s tariff and trade policies will continue to add uncertainty to the global economic environment, implying that gold as a safe haven asset will continue to be in focus.Last week, silver reached an all-time high domestically and hovered near $40 on COMEX, while gold touched a three-week high driven by safe-haven demand amid escalating trade tensions. US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose 30% tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico starting August 1, sparking strong opposition and prompting the EU to extend its suspension of countermeasures while seeking negotiated solutions.Trump also sent tariff notices to 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea, with higher duties set to begin in August, alongside new 50% tariffs on US copper imports and goods from Brazil. These moves stirred volatility in precious metals, with prices dipping as hopes for trade agreements grew. The US dollar index steadied near a two-week high, and Treasury yields hovered close to three-week peaks amid inflation concerns linked to tariffs.Fed officials sent mixed signals over rate cut this year, with some favouring 50 bps cut by Dec '25 while others preferred to wait for tariff impact on inflation. Market expectations shifted toward fewer immediate rate reductions, with a more gradual easing anticipated later in the year. Meanwhile, US jobless claims unexpectedly fell to a seven-week low, signaling stable employment and reducing pressure on the Federal Reserve.Overall, last week reflected rising uncertainty around global trade policies, inflation outlooks, and monetary policy, influencing precious metals and broader markets. Focus this week will be on inflation data from major economies and US PPI, retail sales and industrial production.","Last week, silver reached an all-time high domestically and hovered near $40 on COMEX.

Stock market recommendations:The benchmark Nifty index spent the first four trading sessions of the last week trapped in a tight 200-point range, reflecting the indecision among market participants. But on Friday, the calm broke. The index opened with a sharp gap down, slipped below its consolidation zone, and faced renewed selling pressure, signalling that sentiment is beginning to tilt in favour of the bears.What’s more alarming is that the Nifty has now slipped below its crucial 20-day EMA, which has also begun to slope downward — a classic sign of emerging weakness. The momentum indicators aren’t painting a comforting picture either. The daily RSI has given a bearish crossover and continues to head south, while the MACD histogram has flipped into negative territory. Collectively, these signals suggest that downside momentum may be gaining strength.From a technical standpoint, immediate support now lies in the 24900–24850 zone, where the 50-day EMA is placed. A break below 24850 could push the index toward the next key support at 24550. On the flip side, a move above the 25300–25350 zone is required for bulls to regain control in the short term.Amid this technical caution, macro and earnings uncertainties are only adding to investor anxiety. With tariff uncertainty rising globally and Q1 earnings just getting started—kicked off by TCS on Thursday—markets are entering a critical phase. Investors are now watching for signs of margin pressures, global demand outlooks, and forward guidance from corporates. In this tug-of-war between technical breakdowns and earnings expectations, a cautious and stock-specific approach may be the best strategy for now.Last week, the banking benchmark index Bank Nifty moved within a tight band of just 756 points, marking its narrowest weekly range since August 2024. This lack of movement reflects heightened indecision among market participants and a clear absence of strong directional cues from the banking space. On the weekly chart, the index has formed a small-bodied bearish candle with a long upper shadow, signalling that selling pressure is emerging at higher levels. This candlestick structure typically suggests profit-booking or cautious sentiment whenever the index tries to move higher.Currently, Bank Nifty is hovering around its 20-day EMA level, reinforcing the view that the trend is at a crucial inflection point. The momentum indicators are hinting at a lack of conviction. The daily RSI remains in a sideways zone, as defined by RSI range-shift principles, further underscoring the ongoing consolidation.Going ahead, the zone of 56200-56300 will act as immediate support for the index. While on the upside, the zone of 57100-57200 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index. A decisive breakout in either direction will lead to the trending move in the index.The stock has delivered a decisive breakout from its consolidation phase on the daily chart, signalling a fresh leg of uptrend. What makes this breakout significant is the accompanying surge in volume, lending strong conviction to the move. Notably, the stock has been consistently outperforming the frontline indices over the past few trading sessions, highlighting growing investor interest and relative strength.As the stock is trading at all-time high, all the moving averages and momentum-based setups are showing strong bullish momentum. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 1155-1145 level with a stoploss of Rs 1100 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 1280 in the short term.The stock registered a swing high of 1761 on June 24, followed by a throwback phase that was accompanied by subdued volumes — a sign of healthy profit booking rather than trend reversal. Notably, the correction found support near the 34-day EMA. Post this pullback, the stock has resumed its upward journey, supported by a noticeable rise in volume — adding conviction to the ongoing rebound.Over the past few sessions, it has been outperforming the frontline indices, signalling renewed strength and relative leadership. Momentum indicators are now turning increasingly positive. The daily RSI is comfortably placed in bullish territory, while other oscillators are also supporting the ongoing uptrend. The technical structure suggests that the stock may be gearing up for a fresh move higher in the short term. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 1700-1690 level with a stoploss of Rs 1620 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 1900 in the short term.","The benchmark Nifty index spent the first four trading sessions of the last week trapped in a tight 200-point range.

China GDP growth beats estimates! Economy grows 5.2% in April-June quarter; exports and Trump tariff relief offer cushion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-gdp-growth-beats-estimates-economy-grows-5-2-in-april-june-quarter-exports-and-trump-tariff-relief-offer-cushion/articleshow/122478982.cms,".

China’s economy slowed slightly in the last quarter as US President Donald Trump’s trade war intensified, but still managed to expand at a solid 5.2% pace, the government said on Tuesday.On a quarterly basis, the world’s second-largest economy grew by 1.1%, slightly above the 0.9% rise forecast, according to National Bureau of Statistics data cited by Reuters.This pace marked a slight dip from the 5.4% annual growth recorded between January and March.The Chinese economy posted a 5.3% annual growth rate, in the first half of the year overall.A major boost came from robust export growth. On Monday, China said its exports rose 5.8% in June compared to the same month last year, up from May’s 4.8% increase.A temporary reprieve from the steep US tariffs on Chinese goods triggered a wave of orders from businesses and consumers, as trade talks between the two countries resumed. Chinese companies also stepped up exports through offshore manufacturing and trade with other countries, helping cushion the blow of the Trump administration’s tariff hikes.“Generally speaking, with the more proactive and effective macro policies taking effect ... the national economy maintained steady growth with good momentum, showcasing strong resilience and vitality,” the National Bureau of Statistics said in its report.Still, a 0.1% drop in consumer prices in the first half of 2025 signalled persistent weakness in domestic demand, a longstanding concern for the ruling communist Party.","China's economy grew by 1.1% in the last quarter, slightly above the 0.9% forecast.

Better tax administration leads to surge in refunds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/better-tax-administration-leads-to-surge-in-refunds/articleshow/122427361.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Improvement in tax administration has resulted in a five-fold jump in income tax refunds, while direct tax collections rose three times over the last decade. The time taken has also fallen from 93 days to 17.""The massive increase in tax refunds and decrease in the number of days to issue refunds is due to improvements in tax administration, especially with the adoption of digital infrastructure, including end-to-end online filing and faceless assessment that enables faster and more accurate processing of income tax returns.The introduction of pre-filled returns, automation in refund processing, real-time TDS adjustments, and online grievance redress mechanisms has led to reduced delays and improved taxpayer experience,"" said a source.Refunds as a proportion of gross tax collections were estimated at 17.6 per cent during the last financial year, compared with 11.5 per cent in 2013-2014. ""It is a reflection of increased formalisation and voluntary participation in the tax system.As the taxpayer base expands and advance tax payments and TDS mechanisms deepen, excess remittances become more common. The growing volume and share of refunds are thus not merely a statistical trend but a meaningful signal of systemic maturity.It demonstrates that India's tax ecosystem is now firmly aligned with the principles of efficiency, transparency, and taxpayer facilitation,"" a source argued.Even so far during the current fiscal year, there has been no let-up in refunds despite muted growth in gross collections.

Trump tariffs: US slaps 17% duty on Mexican tomato imports; commerce department calls move fair protection for farmers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-tariffs-us-slaps-17-duty-on-mexican-tomato-imports-commerce-department-calls-move-fair-protection-for-farmers/articleshow/122471085.cms,"Representative Image

The US government on Monday announced a 17% import duty on most fresh tomatoes from Mexico, aiming to protect and revive its own domestic tomato industry.The move comes after talks with Mexican officials collapsed without reaching a new agreement to avoid the tariff.Mexico currently supplies about 70% of the US tomato market, up from just 30% two decades ago.The new duty, which took effect immediately on Monday, is expected to raise tomato prices in the US while benefiting American growers.Supporters of the move argue that it is essential to support US agriculture. Robert Guenther, executive vice president of the Florida tomato exchange, called the tariff “an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.”The decision marks the end of the 2019 tomato suspension agreement between the two countries, which allowed Mexico to export tomatoes to the US under strict price rules and other conditions to avoid being accused of dumping, selling produce at artificially low prices.According to the US commerce department, the deal is being scrapped due to overwhelming complaints from American tomato producers who say they are unable to compete fairly with cheaper Mexican imports.“Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,” said commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.However, critics say the duty will hurt consumers by driving up prices and reducing variety. “As an industry, we are saddened that American consumers will have to pay a tomato tax, or duty, for a reduced selection of the tomatoes they prefer, such as tomatoes on the vine, grape tomatoes, Romas, cocktail tomatoes and other specialty varieties,” said Lance Jungmeyer, president of the Fresh produce association of the Americas.Tim Richards, an agribusiness professor at Arizona State University, estimated that the tariff could push up retail tomato prices by about 8.5 per cent. Jacob Jensen, a trade policy analyst, said that areas more dependent on Mexican tomatoes may see price jumps as high as 10 per cent, while others could experience a 6 per cent rise.Business groups have also warned of other consequences. In a letter to the commerce department, the US chamber of commerce and 30 other organisations said the move could trigger retaliation from trade partners and harm industries beyond tomatoes. “We are concerned that withdrawing from the agreement – at a time when the business community is already navigating significant trade uncertainty – could lead to retaliatory actions by our trading partners,” the letter read.Furthermore, state leaders expressed concerns. Texas governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, and Arizona governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, had urged the government to preserve the agreement to avoid harming their local economies.The new policy aligns with US President Donald Trump’s broader trade approach and comes shortly after his announcement of a separate 30% base tariff on goods from Mexico and the European Union.","Mexico currently supplies about 70% of the US tomato market, up from just 30% two decades ago.

"US manufacturing falters despite policy boost: Donald Trump’s tariffs and Biden’s subsidies fail to lift sector; jobs, output remain stuck in post-pandemic rut",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-manufacturing-falters-despite-policy-boost-donald-trumps-tariffs-and-bidens-subsidies-fail-to-lift-sector-jobs-output-remain-stuck-in-post-pandemic-rut/articleshow/122455449.cms,"US manufacturing is showing persistent signs of stagnation despite a policy push from both political sides — with President Donald Trump deploying steep tariffs and former President Joe Biden previously handing out subsidies — to shore up domestic industry. Job losses and tepid production data point to a sector still waiting for momentum to return.Factories in the US cut 7,000 jobs in June, according to the Labor Department, marking the second straight month of declines. Manufacturing employment is now set to fall for a third consecutive year. Activity also continued to contract in June, with the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reporting that the sector has shrunk in 30 of the past 32 months since October 2022.The analysis highlights the limited impact of both the Biden-era factory investment boom and the Trump administration’s aggressive tariff regime, reported by AP. “The past three years have been a real slog for manufacturing,” said Eric Hagopian, CEO of Pilot Precision Products, a Massachusetts-based industrial tools maker. “We didn’t get destroyed like in 2008, but we’ve been in this stagnant, sort of stationary environment.The slowdown has been driven by several factors, including inflationary pressures that spiked following the post-COVID recovery and the Federal Reserve’s sharp interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023. Though Biden’s clean energy and chip subsidies sparked a surge in factory construction between 2021 and 2024, investments have since slowed after Trump returned to power and Congress reversed many green energy incentives.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, warned that “manufacturing production will continue to flatline,” adding that employment in the sector is likely to shrink further in the coming year.Trump, meanwhile, is pursuing protectionist policies to encourage domestic manufacturing. The administration has imposed tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum, 25% on autos and parts, and 10% on a range of other imports. While the levies offer some companies a pricing edge, they also raise costs on imported materials essential to US producers.“For some bids, the tariff helps us stay competitive,” said Chris Zuzick, VP at Waukesha Metal Products in Wisconsin, AP quoted. But steel prices, buoyed by the protectionist policy, have soared — reaching $960 per metric ton in the US, more than double the $440 world average as of June 23, according to SteelBenchmarker.Despite the high duties, firms like Pilot Precision still source steel from France and Austria — even after paying tariffs — because of price and quality dynamics.Further complicating matters is the lack of clarity around policy. Trump has repeatedly delayed and revised tariff schedules, leaving manufacturers in limbo. “Customers do not want to make commitments in the wake of massive tariff uncertainty,” an ISM survey respondent from the fabricated metal products industry noted. A computer hardware firm added, “The situation remains too volatile to firmly put such plans into place. ”The recent slowdown may also reflect a reversion to pre-pandemic norms. After losing nearly 1.4 million jobs in early 2020, factories surged during the COVID-driven goods boom, adding 379,000 jobs in 2021 and 357,000 in 2022. But hiring then plateaued in 2023 and has since reversed.As of June, factory payrolls stood at 12.75 million — almost unchanged from the 12.74 million recorded in February 2020. “It’s a long, strange trip to get back to where we started,” said Jared Bernstein, chair of Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers.While manufacturers wait for clearer signals from the Trump administration’s upcoming “One Big Beautiful Bill,” many remain cautious. Hagopian is hopeful that targeted tax breaks might help, and Zuzick echoed that it’s too soon to judge the tariff impact: “Manufacturing doesn’t turn on a dime.”With policy flip-flops, cost pressure and weak demand all in play, most factories are keeping hiring and investment plans on hold. “Everyone,” Zuzick said, “is kind of just waiting for the new normal.”","Factories in the US cut 7,000 jobs in June, marking the second straight month of declines.

China Finds Other Markets Apart From US

China’s Trade Resilience Sustainable?

China seems to have diversified its export markets away from the US, reporting a record trade surplus despite the global turmoil and uncertainty created by American President Donald Trump’s tariff war.China achieved a historic trade surplus of approximately $586 billion in the first six months of the year, with exports to the United States showing signs of stabilisation despite the ongoing tariff situation that has disrupted international trade.June saw exports increase by 5.8% year-on-year, reaching $325 billion, surpassing analysts' expectation. Additionally, imports registered their first positive growth since February, rising by 1.1%, according to statistics released by the General Administration of Customs on Monday.Whilst exports to the United States declined by 16.1% compared to the previous year, following May's 34% decrease, Chinese businesses successfully expanded their market presence elsewhere, according to a Bloomberg report.Notably, exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) member states demonstrated remarkable growth, increasing by 17% compared to the same period last year.Also Read | India-US trade deal: Indian team reaches Washington DC for fresh round of talks; Donald Trump’s tariff deadline nears ""China's trade withstood challenges and showed growth in the first half of the year,"" stated Wang Lingjun, deputy head of the customs agency, during a press briefing.""But we need to note that unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise globally, and the external environment is becoming more complex, grim and uncertain,” Wang Lingjun said according to the Bloomberg report.The redirection of exports from the US market demonstrates Chinese manufacturing sector's adaptability, providing support to their decelerating domestic economy during a particularly volatile period in global trade.The sustainability of this recent performance remains uncertain, as the Trump administration seeks to restrict the movement of Chinese goods to America through third-party countries.The United States recently introduced new tariffs on its trading partners, set to be implemented from August 1. Additionally, it imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports and indicated plans for additional sector-specific duties.Also Read | Countering China: India eyes Rs 1,345 crore scheme on rare earth magnets; Indian companies express interest ""The pick-up in headline export growth mainly reflected the rebound of US-bound exports in June, likely due to the substantial tariff reduction following the US-China trade talks in Geneva in May,"" Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists including Andrew Tilton said in a report. ""Both export and import growth surprised to the upside.""Despite US tariffs on Chinese products decreasing to approximately 55% from a peak of 145% in early April, China faces increasing challenges from America's developing trade policies.A recent accord with Vietnam includes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese exports to the United States and a higher 40% duty on transshipped goods, addressing a strategy Chinese exporters have traditionally used to avoid American tariffs.This measure could reduce demand for Chinese products exported directly to the US and affect components used in supply chains across various countries.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced plans for an upcoming meeting with his Chinese counterpart to further their ongoing dialogue.The robust trade performance provides a positive signal for the economy, which has been struggling with deflation and a prolonged property sector downturn that has affected consumer spending and asset values.According to a Bloomberg survey, official data releasing on Tuesday is anticipated to reveal a 5.1% year-on-year increase in gross domestic product for the quarter ended June.""It seems the front loading of exports to the US has not ended,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.

Despite the early pullback, major indexes remained near record highs as investors assessed the likelihood of a negotiated outcome before the August 1 deadline.The S&P 500 slipped 0.1% in early trade, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 78 points, or 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.1%, buoyed by gains in select technology stocks, AP reported.Futures had signalled a weak start earlier in the day, with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq futures each retreating around 0.3% following Trump's announcement over the weekend that the US would impose 30% tariffs on a wide range of imports from the EU and Mexico starting next month. The move extends the administration’s ongoing tariff campaign, which had previously targeted China and other major trading partners.The EU, America’s largest economic partner, is expected to face significant economic fallout if the tariffs take effect. Analysts warned that the levies could raise prices for US consumers on European products ranging from cheese to electronics while rattling European economies.In response, Germany’s DAX index fell 1%, and France’s CAC 40 dropped 0.5%. However, Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.4%, aided by its separate trade deal with the US post-Brexit.The Trump administration has extended its original deadline for new trade deals from July 10 to August 1, leaving a narrow window for potential negotiations. Analysts said they expected efforts to avoid escalation, with some projecting that talks could moderate the impact.On Wall Street, investor focus is also shifting toward earnings season, which kicks off Tuesday. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup are among the top US banks set to report quarterly results.

China's exports rise in June; companies rush order to beat Donald Trump's tariff deadline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-exports-rise-in-june-companies-rush-order-to-beat-donald-trumps-tariff-deadline-check-details/articleshow/122432523.cms,"(Representative AI image)

China's exports grew at a faster pace in June, boosted by a temporary easing of US tariffs that encouraged a surge in orders before a looming August deadline.According to customs data released Monday, exports rose 5.8% year-on-year, up from May’s 4.8% growth, while imports posted their first increase this year, rising 1.1%.The rebound followed a partial reprieve in US tariffs after President Donald Trump and Chinese officials agreed to resume talks, prompting companies to rush orders.Although exports to the US were still down 16% year-on-year, the decline was narrower than the 34.5% plunge in May, according to AP.Analysts say the temporary boost in trade may help support China's economic growth for the April–June quarter, with official GDP figures expected on Tuesday. But the long-term outlook remains unstable.""Tariffs are likely to remain high and Chinese manufacturers face growing constraints on their ability to rapidly expand global market share by slashing prices,"" Zichun Huang of Capital Economics, said in a report.""We therefore expect export growth to slow over the coming quarters, weighing on economic growth,"" Huang added.Despite the ongoing trade war with the US, China's overall trade activity continued to expand.Total trade in the first six months of 2025 crossed 20 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion), with a trade surplus of $586 billion. This suggests that Chinese exporters have been diversifying to offset US losses.Exports to Southeast Asia rose 13% in the first half of 2025. Shipments to Thailand grew 22%, Vietnam 20%, and India over 18%. Trade with the European Union also climbed 6.6% year-on-year during the same period.But not all sectors performed well. Auto exports slumped nearly 38% after the EU imposed steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. Shipments of auto parts fell more than 23%.Meanwhile, exports of rare earth metals rose 32% in June from May levels, likely reflecting progress in bilateral talks to ease restrictions on the supply of critical minerals.China's crude oil imports also rebounded last month, reaching their highest daily average since August 2023, driven by increased refinery output from suppliers like Saudi Arabia and Iran.Iron ore imports grew 8% month-on-month, while soybean imports hit a record high for June, led by increased purchases from Brazil, China’s top supplier amid US sanctions, Reuters reported.With Trump ramping up global tariffs including a 40% duty on transshipments through Vietnam and a 10% threat on imports from BRICS nations, Beijing’s export strategies may face more challenges ahead.However, talks between Washington and Beijing remain fragile, as with no major breakthrough in preliminary negotiations, uncertainty remains high. The White House has warned that tariffs could rise again, up to 30%, pending an August 12 deadline if a broader deal isn’t reached.Until then, exporters remain in limbo as risks continue to mount in the escalating global trade war.","China's exports grew at a faster pace in June, boosted by a temporary easing of US tariffs.

Trade chaos is forcing America's allies closer together, and further from the US. And as that happens, the European Union is trying to position itself at the centre of a new global trade map.The bloc learned this weekend that Washington would subject it to 30% tariffs starting Aug 1. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU executive branch, responded with a pledge to keep negotiating. She also made it clear that, while the EU would delay any retaliation until early Aug, it would continue to draw up plans to hit back with force.But that was not the entire strategy. Europe, like many of the US' trading partners, is also looking for more reliable friends. ""We're living in turbulent times, and when economic uncertainty meets geopolitical volatility, partners like us must come closer together,"" von der Leyen said on Sunday in Brussels at a news conference alongside the Indonesian president, Prabowo Subianto.Just as President Trump threatens to put hefty tariffs on many countries, including Indonesia, the EU is working to relax trade barriers and deepen economic relations.""In hard times, some turn inward, toward isolation and fragmentation,"" von der Leyen said. Then, in a message implicitly extended to world leaders who have been jolted by Trump's tariffs, she added, ""You are always welcome here, and you can count on Europe.""It is a split screen that is becoming typical. On one side, the US sows uncertainty as it blows up weeks of painstaking negotiations and escalates tariff threats. On the other, the 27-nation EU and other American trading partners are forging closer ties, laying the groundwork for a global trading system that revolves less and less around an increasingly fickle US.It will be hard to move away from the US, and Prabowo predicted that America would always be a world leader. But many American trading partners now feel that they are left with little choice but to diversify.Trump has announced 30% tariffs on EU and Mexico. Canada's rate is 35%. The likes of Thailand (35%), Bangladesh (35%) and Brazil (50%), along with dozens of other US trading partners, appear to be headed for a similar fate. Trump has backed down from threatened tariffs before, and he has indicated a willingness to negotiate these tariffs down before their Aug 1 effective date - and the EU and other economies are poised to continue with negotiations. But the atmosphere is increasingly hostile.Hitting back would be just a first step; drawing closer to outside allies may prove even more meaningful in the long run.Since Trump's push to reorder the trading system kicked off in Feb, the EU has been hustling to strike new trade agreements and deepen existing ones. Canada and the EU have pulled together. Britain and the EU have had a rapprochement, five years after Britain officially exited the union. The bloc is working toward closer trading relationships with India and South Africa, and with countries across South America and Asia. Nor is the EU the only global power adopting such a strategy. Canada is also drawing closer to Southeast Asia, while Brazil and Mexico are working to deepen their ties.Officials have even floated the idea of building trading structures that exclude the US and China, which is widely blamed for supporting its factories to the point that they overproduce and flood global markets with cheap goods. Von der Leyen recently suggested that Europe could pursue a new collaboration between the bloc and a trading group of 11 countries that includes Japan, Vietnam and Australia, but that notably did not include the US or China.One key question, analysts said, is whether America's allies will go a step further. Instead of simply collaborating more with one another and leaving the US out, could they actually gang up to counter the US?","The EU is trying to position itself at the centre of a new global trade map.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority ( PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

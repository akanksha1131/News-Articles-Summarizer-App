Ensuring Retirement Products Compete on Merit

Encouraging Long-Term Wealth Building Through Parity

Enhancing Affordability of Social and Rural Insurance through Stamp Duty Reforms

(Tarun Chugh is Managing Director and CEO, Bajaj Life Insurance)

As India charts its economic course for the coming year, the insurance sector remains a key pillar in household financial planning and risk mitigation. Recent regulatory efforts and initiatives have supported sectoral growth, yet broad measures of insurance engagement show there is still significant ground to cover. According to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s annual report, India’s overall insurance penetration stood at 3.7 percent of GDP in FY24, with life insurance coverage at 2.8 percent. This level remains below the global average of over 7 percent. As per a PwC India report on insurance inclusion, in rural India, where around 65 percent of the population resides, less than 10 percent of people have life insurance coverage.These insights serve as a reminder that despite progress, access to financial protection is still limited for large sections of the population. With this context, the upcoming Budget offers an opportunity to strengthen policy support. My recommendations below aim to enhance customer outcomes, improve long term savings participation, and support national goals of financial inclusion and resilience.India’s pension ecosystem continues to face a significant coverage gap.While the National Pension System and other formal pension schemes continue to expand, India's formal pension coverage remains below 25% of the workforce according to the Mercer-CFA Institute Global Pension Index 2025. The report ranks the country 45th out of 47 nations for pension adequacy. Life insurance annuity products and the National Pension System both aim to support retirement income, yet their tax treatment differs considerably.Insurance annuity payouts are taxed on the full amount, including the principal that has already been taxed during the earning years. NPS subscribers, on the other hand, receive additional deductions for self-contribution and employer contribution. This difference in treatment often influences consumer decisions more than product suitability.A more aligned and tax efficient framework across financial products, for example taxing only the returns on annuity payouts and extending comparable deductions to insurance annuity pension products, would allow individuals to choose based on their long term needs rather than tax benefits. Such alignment would encourage more Indians to build structured retirement plans.Over the last few years, high-value traditional insurance policies have received different treatment. For example, for all policies whose annual aggregate premium is higher than Rs. 5 lakh, the maturity proceeds are now taxed at regular income tax rates. These policies, which provide significant life cover in addition to disciplined wealth accumulation, started to be considered less attractive when compared to other alternatives of investment.Meanwhile, high-value Unit Linked insurance policies, whose annual aggregate premium is higher than Rs. 2.5 lakh premium get long-term capital gains treatment, usually more generous and tax efficient. Therefore, introducing similar tax treatment of capital gain on high-value traditional insurance policies as well and bringing both to the same tax treatment would create consistency, simplify the tax code, and encourage more people-particularly business owners, double-income families, and senior professionals to combine protection with savings.As insurance companies strive to meet rural coverage requirements, affordability becomes crucial. Even modest transaction costs such as stamp duty can influence pricing for low ticket products. Exempting rural and social sector policies from stamp duty, similar to the exemption already provided under PMJJBY, would help improve affordability and support deeper penetration.Life insurance can play an important role in shaping India’s long-term financial resilience. While the sector has made progress in expanding access and adapting to changing customer needs, data shows that penetration and coverage gaps persist. Thoughtful policy changes in the upcoming budget can support a more efficient, equitable, and inclusive insurance ecosystem.In the end, financial security should not remain a privilege of a few but be strengthened as a shared foundation for every household.","India’s pension ecosystem continues to face a significant coverage gap.

ITR filing: Why are taxpayers getting messages from Income Tax Department on claims?

Why are taxpayers getting intimations?

What is the department asking taxpayers to do?



Why are refunds being delayed for some?



What happens if the intimation is ignored

ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): The Income Tax Department on Tuesday issued a press release clarifying why several taxpayers have received emails and SMS alerts seeking a review of their tax deduction and exemption claims.The department urged taxpayers to review their deduction and exemption claims for the current assessment year and take corrective steps before the revised deadline of December 31 to avoid penalties or further scrutiny.According to the release, advanced risk analytics under its risk management framework have flagged certain Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for Assessment Year 2025-26.These include cases where deductions or exemptions appear to be ineligible, such as claims related to bogus donations to Registered Unrecognised Political Parties (RUPPs).The department also observed errors in some returns, including incorrect or invalid PAN details of donees and discrepancies in the amount of deductions or exemptions claimed.Taxpayers are being contacted via SMS and email under the department’s NUDGE (Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable) campaign. They are advised to review their returns and file revised ITRs, if required, by December 31, to avoid further enquiries.The Income Tax Department said the initiative reflects a “trust-first” approach, which gives taxpayers an opportunity to voluntarily correct mistakes instead of facing immediate enforcement action.Taxpayers are advised to verify their deduction and exemption claims using supporting documents and reconcile details with Form 16, Form 26AS, the Annual Information Statement (AIS) and the Taxpayer Information Summary (TIS). If errors are found, they should revise their returns within the prescribed timeline.Those whose claims are genuine and legally correct do not need to take any further action, the department clarified.The department added that taxpayers who miss the December 31 deadline may still file an updated return from January 1, 2026, as permitted under the law, though this would involve payment of additional tax.During FY 2025-26, more than 21 lakh taxpayers have already updated their ITRs for assessment years ranging from 2021-22 to 2024-25, paying over Rs 2,500 crore in taxes. For the current assessment year (AY 2025-26), over 15 lakh returns have already been revised.Several salaried taxpayers, particularly those under the old tax regime, have reported receiving intimations stating that their refund processing has been temporarily put on hold due to discrepancies in deduction claims.Tax experts say many such cases involve deductions like Sections 80C, 80D or HRA that were claimed directly in the ITR but were not declared to employers during TDS calculations.Chartered accountants have clarified that this does not automatically make a taxpayer non-compliant, as the Income Tax Act allows eligible deductions to be claimed directly while filing returns, even if they were not considered by the employer.Experts warn that ignoring such communications can have consequences. If discrepancies are not addressed, the department may disallow the deductions, leading to additional tax demand, interest, penalties, delay or cancellation of refunds and even detailed scrutiny or assessment.Tax professionals advise taxpayers not to panic but to promptly review their returns and respond appropriately to avoid future complications.",The Income Tax Department on Tuesday issued a press release clarifying why several taxpayers have received emails and SMS alerts.

Japan govt approves record 122 trillion yen budget,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japan-govt-approves-record-122-trillion-yen-budget/articleshow/126182024.cms,"(Photo credit: AP)

The Japanese government on Friday approved a record budget for the upcoming fiscal year, to pay for everything from bigger defence spending to ballooning social security costs as inflation persists.The 122.3-trillion-yen ($782 billion) budget for the fiscal year from April 2026 will include some nine trillion yen for defence spending, as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi aims to accelerate Tokyo's sweeping upgrade of its military in the face of worsening relations with China.The defence ministry said in a briefing document that ""Japan faces the most severe and complex security environment since the end of the war,"" stressing the need to ""fundamentally strengthen"" its defence capabilities.At the core of its request is 100 billion yen for the so-called SHIELD coastal defence system, which would marshal drones to block any invasion by foreign troops.Japan is hoping that SHIELD -- Synchronised, Hybrid, Integrated and Enhanced Littoral Defence -- will be completed by March 2028, with no details yet on which part of Japan's coastline it will be linked to.The 122-trillion-yen figure compares with the 115 trillion yen sought for the current fiscal year to March, which was also a record.The expanding budget comes as the market worries about Takaichi's big spending policies adding to Japan's public debts.Japan already has the biggest ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) among major economies, projected to reach 232.7 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Earlier this month parliament approved a massive extra budget, to pay for a 21.3-trillion-yen stimulus announced a month earlier.The market has reacted by driving down the value of the yen while the benchmark yield rose for Japanese government bonds.Some observers have drawn comparisons to the UK's 2022 bond market turmoil under then-premier Liz Truss.Takaichi has advocated big government spending to spur economic growth.""What Japan needs right now is not the undermining of our strength as a nation through excessive austerity fiscal policies, but rather the bolstering of our national strength through proactive fiscal policies,"" she told a press conference last week.In an interview Tuesday with the influential Nikkei business daily, Takaichi stressed her commitment to Tokyo's fiscal health, rejecting any ""irresponsible bond issuance or tax cuts.""The current size of the budget is unlikely to shock the bond market, Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a note ahead of Friday.But an increase to around 125 trillion yen or more, he said, would cause the ""turmoil in the bond market, already in crisis mode, to deepen further"".Kiuchi noted that, under Takaichi, the extra budget quickly ballooned, reaching $18 trillion yen.""Financial markets are likely on high alert for a similar occurrence. Should the fall of the yen and bond prices further accelerate due to the size of the budget, it would increase worries about adverse effects on the economy and people's lives.""A weaker yen raises prices of imports for resource-poor Japan, which relies heavily on foreign food, energy and raw materials to power its economy.Takaichi came to power in October with a pledge to fight inflation after anger over rising prices. Another challenge facing the country is its ageing population, caused by chronically low birth rates and a cautious approach to immigration. The draft budget needs to be approved by parliament.",The 122.3-trillion-yen budget for the fiscal year from April 2026 will include some nine trillion yen for defence spending. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi aims to accelerate Tokyo's sweeping upgrade of its military in the face of worsening relations with China.

Attention is pinned on the minutes of the Fed’s December policy meeting, which is due for release on Tuesday. Meanwhile, recent strength in precious metals also showed signs of easing.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index traded at 25,944, adding 125 points or 0.49%. Japan's Nikkei was down over 200 points to 50,550. Shanghai and Shenzhen added 0.4% and 0.19%, respectively. In Korea, Kospi gained 1.6%, to reach 4,197 at 8:40 AM IST.With only a handful of trading sessions left in the year, sentiment has been supported by expectations that US interest rates could be cut further, alongside confidence that the rally led by technology stocks has not yet run out of steam. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve reduced borrowing costs as widely anticipated. However, it also struck a more measured tone, suggesting rates could remain unchanged at its next meeting, after two policymakers opposed a cut and one pushed for a deeper reduction.On the commodities front, gold and silver pulled back after surging to record levels in recent days. Both metals have benefited from strong buying interest, fuelled by expectations that lower interest rates would enhance their appeal, as well as their traditional role as safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty. Geopolitical tensions, including US strikes in Nigeria and a blockade involving Venezuelan oil tankers, have further added to their attractiveness.Gold was hovering near $4,500 on Monday, after topping out just under $4,550 late last week. Silver slipped to $77.50, having briefly touched a record $80. The metal’s sharp rise has also been underpinned by tightening supply and rising industrial demand.Oil prices recovered some ground after falling more than two percent on Friday, as markets assessed developments from weekend talks between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky on possible peace proposals.Trump said on Sunday that an agreement to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was closer than ever, though he acknowledged there had been no clear breakthrough on territorial questions. He added that it would become evident within weeks whether the nearly four-year-long conflict, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives, could be brought to an end.","Asian markets mostly traded in green on Monday, beginning the week on a positive note.

Indian developers’ experience scores higher: DX survey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-developers-experience-scores-higher-dx-survey/articleshow/126222665.cms,"Representative image

SALT LAKE CITY: India has emerged as a key geography in how global enterprises analyse software productivity, with engineering intelligence firm DX saying it has surveyed more than 100,000 engineers in the country as part of its developer experience research.The data shows developers based in India consistently report 10-15% higher self-reported developer experience scores than their counterparts in Western markets, a divergence that has led the company to run separate India-specific benchmarks. DX was recently acquired by Atlassian for $1 billion.The findings were shared by DX founder and chief executive Abi Noda in an interview with TOI. He said the pattern has appeared consistently across companies and industries.The scores are derived from structured, attitudinal survey questions that capture developers’ own perceptions of their work environment, rather than output-based measures such as lines of code written or tickets closed. These questions focus on practical aspects of day-to-day engineering work, including the ability to focus without interruptions, ease of understanding and modifying existing code, access to documentation and information, and friction caused by tools and internal processes.“Across these attitudinal survey questions, we consistently see higher scores from developers in India,” Noda said. He added DX does not interpret this as automatic evidence of higher productivity, noting that cultural differences in how responses are given could influence results. “Because of that, we adjust how benchmarks are run when a company has a large India-based engineering workforce,” he said. India’s prominence reflects the globalisation of engineering teams.","India has emerged as a key geography in how global enterprises analyse software productivity.

Given the adjacency, we are keen on entering the critical minerals space and believe it is a strategic fit. We are working on identifying how we can create value,” Subhrakant Panda, MD, IMFA told TOI, adding that the plans are at a “preliminary stage. ”Panda said IMFA’s experience in mining and smelting provides “a strong foundation” and the company is also “actively looking at opportunities” overseas and will “evaluate if there is an attractive proposition.”He said the company has a debt-free balance sheet as well as significant accruals from existing operations. “I do not see any issue in funding a critical minerals venture once we identify the right opportunity,” said Panda, when asked about any fund raising plans for its proposed foray into the critical minerals space.IMFA, which is listed both on BSE and NSE and counts Korean steel giant Posco as one its customers, operates six furnaces with a total capacity of 190 MVA and annual production capacity of 284,000 tonnes across its units in Therubali and Choudwar.

PAN-Aadhaar Deadline Nears: How To Link Before December 31 Or Risk Inoperative PAN From Next Year

How to link PAN with Aadhaar card: Step-by-step guide

To begin with, you will have to pay a mandatory fee through the Income Tax Department’s e-Filing portal.

Visit the portal homepage (https://www.incometax.gov.in/iec/foportal/), select the Link Aadhaar option under Quick Links. Now enter your PAN card and Aadhaar card details.

After choosing to pay through e-Pay Tax, you are required to re-enter your PAN, verify your mobile number through an OTP, select the Income Tax option, and proceed to payment.

The assessment year must be selected and the payment category should be marked as Other Receipts (500). The Rs 1,000 amount is auto-filled and can be paid using net banking, debit card, or UPI. The payment may take four to five working days to reflect in the system.

Once the payment is confirmed (which can take a few days), taxpayers can make the linking request.

Go to the Link Aadhaar section, enter your PAN and Aadhaar details, and validate the information.

A confirmation message stating ""Your payment details are verified."" should appear, after which users must enter their name as per Aadhaar and their mobile number.

They are also required to confirm Aadhaar validation and indicate if only the year of birth is mentioned on their Aadhaar record.

The process is completed by entering the six-digit OTP sent to the registered mobile number.

Taxpayers can also check the status of their PAN-Aadhaar linkage without logging in. By selecting Link Aadhaar Status under Quick Links on the e-Filing homepage and entering PAN and Aadhaar details, users can view the current status. A successful linkage is indicated by a green checkmark, while pending cases will display a message stating that the request has been forwarded to UIDAI for validation.

The final date to complete your PAN–Aadhaar card linking is December 31, 2025. Beginning January 1, 2026, the Income Tax Department will declare all PAN cards that remain unlinked with Aadhaar card as inoperative.As per Notification No. 26/2025, issued on April 3, 2025, individuals who were allotted a PAN using an Aadhaar Enrolment ID before October 1, 2024 are required to complete the linkage using their permanent Aadhaar card number by the end of 2025. PAN cards that are not linked by the deadline will be marked inactive or inoperative and cannot be used for tax-related or major financial transactions, according to an ET report.The Central Board of Direct Taxes has cautioned that non-compliance will have financial consequences, including suspension of income tax refunds and the application of higher tax deduction at source rates from January 1, 2026.To complete the linkage, taxpayers must first ensure that they have a valid PAN, an Aadhaar number, and a registered mobile phone to receive one-time passwords. A fee of Rs 1,000 is applicable in cases where the PAN was issued before July 1, 2017 and has not been linked earlier, the report said.","PAN cards that are not linked by the deadline will be marked inactive or inoperative. Non-compliance will have financial consequences, including suspension of income tax refunds and the application of higher tax deduction at source rates from January 1, 2026.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126136106,imgsize-95638,width-400,resizemode-4/pan-aadhaar-linking.jpg"

Why are some taxpayers getting intimations from the tax department, what is the nature of deduction and exemption claims being questioned, and what should taxpayers do? We take a look:

What's the Income Tax Department’s ‘NUDGE’ campaign?

PAN-Aadhaar Deadline Nears: How To Link Before December 31 Or Risk Inoperative PAN From Next Year

What is NUDGE campaign?

ITR filing & Refunds: Why are taxpayers getting ‘nudges’?

What kind of exemptions and deductions are likely under scrutiny?

What should taxpayers do if they get a ‘nudge’ from tax authorities?

Amarpal Chadha shares a checklist:

Verify Deductions and Exemptions: Check all deductions and exemptions claimed in the income-tax return and ensure adequate documentation exists to substantiate each claim

Check all deductions and exemptions claimed in the income-tax return and ensure adequate documentation exists to substantiate each claim Identify Discrepancies: Compare the return filed with Form 16, bank statements, investment proofs, and other records to spot any discrepancies.

ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): The Income Tax Department is stepping up scrutiny for tax returns and income tax refund claims and many taxpayers are getting alerts to check their exemption and deduction claims. The last date to file income tax returns for FY 2024-25 was pushed to September 15, 2025 this year since the tax department took time to release forms and update the portal. However, the last date to file an updated or belated return for the current assessment year remains December 31, 2025.Several taxpayers are also facing delays in their returns and refunds being processed. Ahead of the important deadline, the Income Tax Department has issued a clarification on why some taxpayers are getting alerts to review their ITRs.The Income Tax Department has said that in the ongoing financial year 2025–26, over 21 lakh taxpayers have already updated their ITRs for AYs 2021–22 to 2024–25 and paid more than ₹2,500 crore in taxes. Also, over 15 lakh ITRs have been revised for the current assessment year.In a press release, the Income Tax Department has said that some taxpayers have claimed ‘ineligible’ refunds - through the deductions and exemptions route.This has led to their income being underreported.“Under the risk management framework, and through the use of advanced data analytics, cases for Assessment Year (AY) 2025–26 have been identified,” the Income Tax Department said.The tax department on its part is ‘nudging’ taxpayers to update their tax returns in case there is some discrepancy in the deductions and exemptions.Identified taxpayers are being sent SMS and email under the government’s “Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable (NUDGE)” campaign. The aim is to encourage these taxpayers to correct errors in tax return filing, ahead of the December 31, 2025 deadline.“This initiative reflects a trust-first approach to tax administration, under which taxpayers are provided an opportunity to review their Income-tax Returns (ITRs) and voluntarily correct any ineligible claims, wherever required,” the tax department said.“The campaign leverages data analytics and technology to enable a transparent, non-intrusive, and taxpayer-centric compliance environment, with an emphasis on guidance and voluntary compliance,” the department adds.The tax department has advised the concerned taxpayers to “review their ITRs, verify the correctness of their deduction and exemption claims, and revise their returns, if required, within the prescribed time by 31 December 2025, so as to avoid further enquiries in the matter.”Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner at EY India explains that the NUDGE campaign is an initiative of the Income Tax Department aimed at encouraging taxpayers to voluntarily review deduction or exemption claims that have been identified as potentially ineligible through data analytics.The Department is also leveraging global information-exchange frameworks such as the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI), Common Reporting Standards (CRS), and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) to identify possible discrepancies in foreign asset reporting, Chadha told TOI.Under the tax department’s initiative, taxpayers may receive an email or SMS explaining the reason for the communication and advising them to verify the accuracy of deductions or exemptions claimed, as well as the correctness of foreign asset disclosures. Where a taxpayer believes that corrective action is required, a revised return may be filed on or before December 31, 2025, which is the deadline for filing updated income tax returns for FY 2024-25Tanu Gupta, Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP has a clear message: In principle, all those exemptions and deductions which are not genuine are likely to come under scrutiny.“Even those deductions and exemptions which are inconsistent with the income tax department's records/information/data, may also come under scrutiny. The most sought-after deduction/exemption currently includes ""Donation to Political Parties"", ""House Rent Allowance"" to name a few,” she told TOI.According to Amarpal Chadha, any deduction that is claimed for donations to political parties where an incorrect or invalid PAN of the donee has been provided may come under the Income Tax Department’s scrutiny.The tax department has said that there are also cases where the taxpayers have given incorrect or invalid PAN details. Other cases pertain to the extent of deductions and exemptions that are being claimed by the taxpayers.“In addition, any deduction or exemption claimed in the income-tax return over and above what is reflected in Form 16 such as HRA exemption, exemptions under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), gratuity exemption etc. are also under tax department’s radar,” he told TOI.Tanu Gupta recommends that for all the claims including exemptions and deductions, the taxpayer should always keep in handy the following documents: receipts / invoices of the payments for which exemption / deduction is claimed, bank statement evidencing such payment through proper banking channels, receipts from the recipient to corroborate with such payments.These are broad guidelines for the documents which the taxpayer should anyway keep on files for a good financial housekeeping, she says.Is there a need for panic? No, says Tanu Gupta. “Instead, the taxpayer needs to revisit their claims of exemptions and deductions in the return and take action accordingly viz file the revised return if needed. As the name suggests, the abbreviation and the complete name of it (Non-Intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable), it is to facilitate the taxpayer to file compliant tax returns voluntarily, with correct, justified and genuine claims of deductions/exemptions,” she tells TOI.“There are cases where the taxpayers have received the communication from the department, although they believe that they do not have any inconsistency for the claims made in the return. They only need to see if they have all supporting documents for such payments to submit to the tax authorities when asked for,” explains Tanu Gupta, adding that wherever such exemptions / deductions are not authentic, the taxpayer needs to immediately revise the tax return by reversing such claims in the returns; and pay due income tax along with interest.If any claim or reporting needs correction, file a revised return within the prescribed timeline currently on or before December 31, 2025, he says.“However, if the taxpayer believes that the exemptions or deductions claimed are accurate and valid, they may wait for further communication from the Income Tax Department,” he adds.It is important to restate here that taxpayers do not have to worry where their tax claims are genuine.The Income Tax Department has clarified that taxpayers whose claims are genuine and correctly made in accordance with law are not required to take any further action.“It is clarified that taxpayers who do not avail of this opportunity may still file an updated return from 1 January 2026, as permitted under law, subject to payment of additional tax liability,” it has said.","Identified taxpayers are being sent SMS and email under the government’s ‘Non- intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and Enable (NUDGE)’ campaign. The aim is to encourage these taxpayers to correct errors in tax return filing, ahead of the December 31, 2025 deadline.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126159165,imgsize-48186,width-400,resizemode-4/income-tax-return.jpg"
China's BYD poised to overtake Tesla in 2025 EV sales,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-byd-poised-to-overtake-tesla-in-2025-ev-sales/articleshow/126222415.cms,"Growing Chinese auto giant BYD stands poised to officially surpass Tesla as the world's biggest electric vehicle company in annual sales.The two groups are expected soon to publish their final figures for 2025, and based on sales data so far this year, there is almost no chance the American company led by Elon Musk will retain its leadership position.At the end of November, Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid vehicles, had sold 2.07 million EVs so far in 2025.Tesla, for its part, had sold 1.22 million by the end of September.Tesla's September figures included a one-time boost in sales, to nearly half-a-million vehicles in a three-month period, before the expiration of a US tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles -- which ended under legislation backed by President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic.But Tesla's sales in the coming quarter are expected to fall to 449,000, according to a FactSet analysis consensus. That would give Tesla about 1.65 million sales for all of 2025, a drop of 7.7 percent and well below the level BYD had attained by end November.Deutsche Bank, which projects just 405,000 Tesla EV sales during the fourth quarter, sees the company's sales down by around one-third in both North America and Europe, and by one-tenth in China.- Transition period -Industry watchers say it will take time for EV demand to reach a level of equilibrium in the United States following the elimination of the $7,500 US tax credit at the end of September 2025.Even prior to that, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over CEO Musk's political support of Trump and other far-right politicians. Tesla has also faced rising EV competition from BYD and other Chinese companies and from European giants.""We believe Tesla will see some weakness on deliveries"" in the fourth quarter, said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.Sales of 420,000 would be ""good enough to show stable demand,"" with Wall Street ""laser focused on the autonomous chapter kicking off in 2026,"" Ives added, referring to plans for self-driving vehicles.Even as it has grown quickly, BYD has faced challenges in its home market.With profitability in China weighed down by price-wary consumers, the company has sought to strengthen its foothold in foreign markets.BYD is ""one of the pioneers to establish overseas production capacity and supply chains for EVs,"" Jing Yang, Director of Asia-Pacific Corporate Ratings at Fitch Ratings, told AFP.""Going forward, its geographical diversification is likely to help it to navigate an increasingly complicated global tariff environment,"" said Yang.Overseas rivals to BYD have balked at Chinese state subsidies and other state supports that have allowed the company to sell vehicles cheaply.Trump's predecessor Joe Biden imposed 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EV imports that could potentially go even higher under Trump. Europe has also imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, but BYD is building manufacturing capacity in Hungary.While the chance of Tesla reclaiming its global leadership in EVs looks uncertain, the American company is also potentially positioned for growth.Michaeli of TD Cowen sees autonomous technology playing an increasingly important role for Tesla, with breakthroughs in its ""full self-driving"" or ""FSD"" offerings potentially boosting sales.""As Tesla really begins to roll out eyes-off features and expand FSDs capability, if they do that successfully, that should generate more demand for their vehicles,"" Michaeli said.Musk has said the Cybercab, an autonomous robotaxi model, will begin production in April 2026. The company has also unveiled lower-priced versions of the Models 3 and Y that could boost sales.","Chinese auto giant BYD stands poised to officially surpass Tesla as the world's biggest electric vehicle company.

Bulgaria adopts euro amid fear and uncertainty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bulgaria-adopts-euro-amid-fear-and-uncertainty/articleshow/126213989.cms,".

'Substantial' gains

Stability needed

SOFIA: Bulgaria will become the 21st country to adopt the euro on Thursday, but some believe the move could bring higher prices and add to instability in the European Union's poorest country.A protest campaign emerged this year to ""keep the Bulgarian lev"", playing on public fears of price rises and a generally negative view of the euro among much of the population.But successive governments have pushed to join the eurozone and supporters insist it will boost the economy, reinforce ties to the West and protect against Russia's influence.The single currency first rolled out in 12 countries on January 1, 2002, and has since regularly extended its influence, with Croatia the last country to join in 2023.But Bulgaria faces unique challenges, including anti-corruption protests that recently swept a conservative-led government from office, leaving the country on the verge of its eighth election in five years.Boryana Dimitrova of the Alpha Research polling institute, which has tracked public opinion on the euro for a year, told AFP any problems with euro adoption would be seized on by anti-EU politicians.Any issues will become ""part of the political campaign, which creates a basis for rhetoric directed against the EU"", she said.While far-right and pro-Russia parties have been behind several anti-euro protests, many people, especially in poor rural areas, worry about the new currency.""Prices will go up. That's what friends of mine who live in Western Europe told me,"" Bilyana Nikolova, 53, who runs a grocery store in the village of Chuprene in northwestern Bulgaria, told AFP.The latest survey by the EU's polling agency Eurobarometer suggested 49 percent of Bulgarians were against the single currency.After hyperinflation in the 1990s, Bulgaria pegged its currency to the German mark and then to the euro, making the country dependent on the European Central Bank (ECB).""It will now finally be able to take part in decision making within this monetary union,"" Georgi Angelov, senior economist at the Open Society Institute in Sofia, told AFP.An EU member since 2007, Bulgaria joined the so-called ""waiting room"" to the single currency in 2020, at the same time as Croatia.The gains of joining the euro are ""substantial"", ECB president Christine Lagarde said last month in Sofia, citing ""smoother trade, lower financing costs and more stable prices"".Small and medium-sized enterprises stand to save an equivalent of some 500 million euros ($580 million) in exchange fees, she added.One sector expected to benefit in the Black Sea nation is tourism, which this year generated around eight percent of the country's GDP.Lagarde predicted the impact on consumer prices would be ""modest and short-lived"", saying in earlier euro changeovers, the impact was between 0.2 and 0.4 percentage points.But consumers -- already struggling with inflation -- fear they will not be able to make ends meet, according to Dimitrova.Food prices in November were up five percent year-on-year, according to the National Statistical Institute, more than double the eurozone average.Parliament this year adopted empowered oversight bodies to investigate sharp price hikes and curb ""unjustified"" surges linked to the euro changeover.But analysts fear wider political uncertainty risks delaying much needed anti-corruption reforms, which could have a knock-on effect on the wider economy.""The challenge will be to have a stable government for at least one to two years, so we can fully reap the benefits of joining the euro area,"" Angelov said.","Bulgaria will become the 21st country to adopt the euro on Thursday.

Chilean regulators authorized the alliance earlier in December.The agreement was approved by more than 20 national and international regulatory bodies, including in China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the European Union.Chile was the last of the countries to clear the deal.Last month, China gave the green light to the planned partnership between Codelco and SQM.The partnership aims to restore Chile's leadership in lithium production, a title it lost to Australia nearly a decade ago.The new company aims to increase production by about 300,000 tons per year in the Atacama salt flat.In 2022, Chile produced 243,100 tons of the so-called white gold.""This joint venture makes it possible to plan the development of the Atacama salt flat,"" and for the benefit of global markets, said Ricardo Ramos, CEO of SQM, one of the world's leading lithium producers.The partnership is part of the National Lithium Strategy announced by the leftist government of Gabriel Boric in 2023, aimed at reclaiming Chile's global leadership in lithium production.According to Codelco, with this agreement the Chilean state will receive around 70 percent of the operating margin generated by the new production between 2025 and 2030, and starting in 2031, 85 percent of that margin.Lithium accounted for three percent of Chile's exports in 2024.","Chile is the world's second-largest producer of lithium, a key component of EVs and other clean technologies.

China's industry profits stumble: Profits in November fall 13.1%; biggest decline in over a year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-industries-stumble-profits-in-november-fall-13-1-per-cent-biggest-decline-in-over-a-year/articleshow/126206691.cms,"Representative AI image

China's industrial firms saw their profits drop by 13.1 per cent in November, from last year, marking the steepest decline in over a year. This fall came despite strong exports, putting focus on country's ongoing economic struggles and increasing pressure for more government support. The National Bureau of Statistics released these figures on Saturday, as quoted by Reuters.The decline was worse than October's 5.5 per cent. This trend comes as China faces persistent factory-gate deflation and weak consumer spending. For the first 11 months of the year, industrial profits barely grew, showing just a 0.1% increase compared to the previous year's 1.9% growth.""The profit numbers show a broader cooling in economic activity in the fourth quarter, mainly due to the drag from soft domestic demand,"" said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Xu remained cautiously optimistic about future profits, suggesting companies might find more opportunities overseas.Despite this, there were some industries that managed to register gains. The automobile industry posted a 7.5 per cent rise in profitability, while the high tech industry posted a 10 per cent rise. A massive decline of 47.3 percent in profitability was seen in the coal mine industry.An estimate by the think tank, Rhodium Group, quoted by Reuters, indicated a growth of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent in the Chinese economy for the year, which is approximately half the officially-hinted growth.Chinese policymakers are now promising more support. At a recent meeting, they pledged to maintain ""proactive"" fiscal policies next year. The government has also committed to improving employment, boosting consumption, stabilizing prices, and helping the struggling property market.NBS Chief Statistician Yu Weining noted that industrial firms still need stronger support, especially given the uncertain global environment and ongoing changes in growth drivers. The data covers companies earning at least 20 million yuan ($2.85 million) in annual revenue from their main operations.","China's industrial firms saw their profits drop by 13.1 per cent in November, from last year, marking the steepest decline in over a year.

""Barring any exogenous event, the path of least resistance for stocks, I think, is higher,"" he added.The Federal Reserve's recent actions are keeping investors on edge. The Fed cut rates by 75 basis points over its last three meetings of 2025, bringing them to 3.50 per cent-3.75 per cent.

China Sets New Record in Superconducting Maglev Propulsion

Chinese scientists have achieved a milestone in magnetic levitation technology. Researchers at China's National University of Defence Technology successfully propelled a one-tonne vehicle to 700 kilometers per hour in just two seconds on a 400-meter test track, setting a new world record for superconducting electric maglev systems.The test, shown in footage making rounds on social media and Chinese news outlets, displayed a chassis-like vehicle zooming across the track leaving a misty trail. This demonstrates significant progress in both extreme acceleration capabilities and high-power control systems.""It resolves core technical challenges including ultra-high-speed electromagnetic propulsion, electric suspension guidance, transient high-power energy storage inversion, and high-field superconducting magnets,"" CCTV stated, as reported by South China Morning Post (SCMP).This breakthrough could revolutionise various transportation methods, from hyperloop systems to aerospace launches.The same team had previously reached 648 km/h on the same track in January. Their decade-long research puts China at the forefront of global maglev technology, marking significant progress since developing their first manned maglev train thirty years ago.Professor Li Jie, who led Beijing's first commercial maglev subway line, believes this success will speed up China's ultra-high-speed maglev transport development.In 2020, CRRC Qingdao Sifang had tested a 600km/h prototype. In the meantime, Southwest Jiaotong University developed a high-temperature superconducting maglev system in Chengdu targeting speeds over 600km/h.The latest development includes a collaboration between the Third Research Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation and North University of China. The built a 2-kilometer experimental line in Datong for testing maglev trains in low-vacuum pipelines, with an aim for eventual speeds of 1,000 km/h.This technology has the potential to transform city-to-city travel through vacuum-sealed tubes and potentially revolutionise rocket launches by reducing fuel consumption during takeoff. It also offers new possibilities for testing high-speed flight equipment through ground-based simulations.",Chinese scientists have achieved a milestone in magnetic levitation technology.

"Silver price today: White metal soars 9% to record high; gold, platinum & others follow the momentum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/silver-price-today-white-metal-soars-9-to-record-high-gold-platinum-others-follow-the-momentum/articleshow/126200549.cms,"Precious metals soar - What's behind the rally?

Silver price jumped nearly 9% to trade at a record high of $78.65, on Friday (local time) according to the New York Commodity Exchange. With this surge, the white metal has outpaced gold this year, with prices up more than 158% over the past 12 months.The rally extended across the broader metals market. Spot gold climbed to an all-time high of $4,549.71 an ounce, while platinum touched a record $2,454.12 after gaining around 10%, according to Reuters. Spot palladium also recorded the sharpest move of the session, rising more than 14% to $1,924.03 an ounce.Gold, meanwhile, edged up just over 1.2% to reach a high of $4,562.70.Silver rose on the back of tight supply, rising industrial demand and expectations of more rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Analysts have also pointed to a mix of lower interest rates, growing use of silver in AI data centres, supply constraints and uncertainty around tariffs as key drivers behind the white metal’s surge this year.“Prospect of lower US interest rates is still supporting demand for gold and silver, lifting both metals to new record highs,” UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo told Reuters. In early trading, silver crossed the $75-per-ounce level for the first time, as both precious and industrial metals rallied amid economic and political uncertainty.Gold is on course for its strongest annual performance since 1979, supported by Federal Reserve policy easing, geopolitical risks, central bank buying, higher ETF holdings and ongoing de-dollarisation. Silver has benefited from structural supply deficits, its designation as a US critical mineral and strong industrial demand, far outpacing gold’s nearly 72% rise.Platinum and palladium, widely used in automotive catalytic converters, have also advanced sharply amid tight supply conditions, tariff uncertainty and a shift in investment demand away from gold. Platinum has gained about 165% this year, while palladium is up more than 90% year to date.“Momentum-driven and speculative players have been powering the rally in gold and silver since early December, with thin year-end liquidity, expectations of prolonged US rate cuts, a weaker dollar and a flare-up in geopolitical risks combining to push precious metals to fresh record highs,” Kelvin Wong, senior market analyst at OANDA, told Reuters.“Looking ahead into the first half of 2026, gold could move towards the $5,000 level, while silver has the potential to reach around $90,” Wong further said.Traders are currently pricing in two US rate cuts next year, a support that continues to lift non-yielding assets such as gold and silver. At the same time, market sentiment has also been influenced by geopolitical developments, including US moves related to Venezuelan oil and strikes against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria following attacks on Christian communities.","Silver price jumped nearly 9% to trade at a record high of $78.65, on Friday (local time) With this surge, the white metal has outpaced gold this year, with prices up more than 158% over the past 12 months.

'Year of tariff consequences': Global trade in 2026 — another rough patch ahead?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/year-of-tariff-consequences-global-trade-in-2026-another-rough-patch-ahead/articleshow/126200153.cms,"'India Got Out Of The Gates Faster Than Most Nations', Says US Expert As Trade Deal Talks Nears End

2026 — The year of tariff consequences

The year 2025, reshaped global commerce in ways not seen for decades, moving into another uncertain phase, as pressures on growth and stability are expected to intensify. So will 2026 be another turbulent patch for global trade?Global merchandise trade managed to stay resilient through 2025, even as US President Donald Trump pushed ahead with higher tariffs that effectively raised barriers around the world’s largest economy. According to data cited by shipping industry veteran John McCown, global container volumes increased 2.1% in October compared with the same month last year, according to Bloomberg.Overall figures, however, revealed sharp regional divergences.While inbound container volumes into the US fell by 8%, imports into Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and India recorded strong growth, pointing to a rebalancing of global trade flows.“World container supply chains have already begun to adapt and reconfigure trading patterns,” McCown wrote in a research note cited by Bloomberg. He compared the current slowdown with last year’s rally, noting that after a 15.2% rise in US container imports in 2024, “to say that the annual total for 2025 will be in diametric contrast is an understatement.”McCown attributed much of this shift to Trump’s trade policies.In a LinkedIn post, he argued that if 2025 marked the peak of tariff announcements, the impact would be felt more fully in the year ahead. He wrote that if 2025 was the year of the tariff, 2026 will be the year of tariff consequences.Trade analysts said that several fault lines are already visible as 2026 draws closer. One of the most closely watched developments will be the review of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, the North American trade pact that came into force in 2020. The agreement is due for reassessment just six years after implementation, an unusually short timeframe for such a deal.US trade representative Jamieson Greer told lawmakers this month that the process has drawn heavy engagement, with more than 1,500 responses submitted during the public consultation. “Many stakeholders expressed support for the USMCA and many explicitly called for the agreement to be extended,” Greer said, as quoted by Bloomberg.“At the same time, virtually all stakeholders also called for some sort of improvement to the agreement.” Any attempt to revise the deal is expected to be contentious, as gains for one member could come at the expense of another. Industries in both Canada and Mexico are already under pressure from US import duties, while diplomatic relations remain strained. Tensions worsened in October after Trump halted trade talks with Canada in response to anti-tariff advertisements featuring Ronald Reagan.At the same time, global shipping faces the prospect of fresh disruption. Industry experts warn that two developments, both seemingly positive, could strain supply chains.The first is a possible large-scale return of cargo vessels to the Red Sea, after shipping lines were diverted around southern Africa for nearly two years due to Houthi attacks. With hostilities easing since the Gaza peace plan took effect in October, the route has become safer. French carriers CMA CGM SA and Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S have already resumed limited transits through the area.But a full return to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal could overwhelm existing infrastructure. Lars Jensen, chief executive of consultancy Vespucci Maritime, warned during a Flexport webinar in November that it would “flood the market with a lot more capacity” and lead to “massive port congestion issues in Europe.”A second risk could emerge from stronger demand. Jensen said that if the US economy accelerates in 2026 as Trump administration officials predict, driven by lower interest rates and increased investment, a wave of inventory restocking could exceed the shipping sector’s ability.Uncertainty also surrounds the durability of the Trump administration’s recent trade agreements. While the White House has highlighted deals struck with several major economies in 2025, these arrangements lack the enforcement mechanisms typical of traditional trade pacts. Most include only short-term commitments, and the truce with China extends for just one year, leaving unresolved the US’s most imbalanced trading relationship.Concerns that these agreements could unravel have been reinforced by recent events. Indonesia has resisted US trade demands since Washington announced what it called a “landmark trade deal” in July, fearing constraints on its independence, with a revised agreement now expected in late January. China has raised objections with Malaysia and Cambodia over their trade deals with the US, warning against actions that undermine Beijing’s interests. The UK has also encountered fresh complications, Bloomberg reported.Greer said last week that difficult negotiations with the European Union and India are likely to continue into the new year. His office also warned of possible retaliation against the EU, citing what Washington views as excessive regulation of American technology firms.Adding to the uncertainty is a pending US Supreme Court decision on the legality of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, the sweeping duties imposed on most major trading partners. A ruling against the administration could raise questions over whether importers would be refunded tariffs already paid.Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CBS’s Face the Nation that even in such a scenario, refunds were unlikely. It would be “pretty unlikely that they’re going to call for widespread refunds, because it would be an administrative problem,” he said.Betting markets currently assign roughly a 75% probability to Trump losing the case, a result that could push the administration to rely on alternative legal powers to maintain tariffs.","Global merchandise trade managed to stay resilient through 2025, even as US President Donald Trump pushed ahead with higher tariffs.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

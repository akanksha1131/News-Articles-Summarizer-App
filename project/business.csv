Gold prices fell last week as a stronger dollar, profit booking, easing US-China trade tensions dented safe-haven demand, with investors cautiously tracking major central bank meetings for fresh monetary policy cues. Dollar index inched towards the 100 mark, hitting a three-week high, while the USDINR strengthened, supporting domestic bullion sentiment.After, US and Chinese officials outlined a trade framework for Presidents Trump and Xi to finalize later last week, easing fears of renewed tariff escalation, leaders met and gave hope to market regarding a ease off in the trade war. China is expected to delay its rare earth licensing regime and resume US soybean purchases, signaling improving trade relations. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 bps to 3.75%–4.00%, second reduction this year, and announced an end to QT effective December 1.However, Chair Powell’s cautious tone and lack of commitment to further cuts pressured bullion, as markets reduced the odds of another rate cut in December. The US shutdown continues to cloud key data releases, adding uncertainty to the outlook.Over the weekend, Fed injected ~29.4B, indicating short term funding stress and an interesting move just as they announced end of QT from December 1st.Also, China removed a key tax break that earlier allowed gold retailers to offset VAT on gold brought from the Shanghai Gold exchange.Similarly, comments from China regarding the trade talks last week are still pending and further updates regarding the same could provide further weigh on prices.","Gold prices are likely to be weighed down by global developments in the near –term, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

8th Pay Commission: How is hike in pension amount calculated? Check details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/8th-pay-commission-how-is-hike-in-pension-amount-calculated-check-details/articleshow/125016354.cms,"Factors determining the hike



How pensions will be recalculated

Fitment factor

Revised basic pay (on Rs 40,000 old basic)

Revised basic pension (50%)

2.57



Rs 1,02,800



Rs 51,400



3.0



Rs 1,20,000



Rs 60,000



3.68



Rs 1,47,200



Rs 73,600





Dearness relief , family pension and EPS also see automatic gains

Old pension: Rs 20,000 → DR @ 20% = Rs 4,000

Revised pension: Rs 30,000 → DR @ 20% = Rs 6,000

For instance:

Old basic pay Rs 40,000 → EPS Rs 20,000

With a fitment factor of 3.0 → revised pay Rs 1,20,000 → EPS Rs 60,000

Higher pension also means higher tax liability

Before revision:

Pension (basic): Rs 20,000 per month = Rs 2,40,000 per year

DR: Rs 6,000 per month = Rs 72,000 per year

Total taxable pension income: Rs 3,12,000

Tax payable: Rs 600

After revision (with higher fitment factor):

Pension (basic): Rs 50,000 per month = Rs 6,00,000 per year

DR: Rs 15,000 per month = Rs 1,80,000 per year

Total taxable pension income: Rs 7,80,000

Total tax payable: Rs 66,000

The fitment factor under the 8th Pay Commission will be decided once the Union Cabinet considers and clears the commission’s recommendations.





Many retired central government employees are waiting to see how the 8th Pay Commission will impact their pensions, now that the Centre has approved the commission’s Terms of Reference (ToR) and given an 18-month timeline for the report.Although pay commission discussions usually revolve around serving employees, pensioners outnumber them.As per the government’s Pensioners’ Portal, there were 68.72 lakh pensioners as of October 30 across civil, defence, telecommunications, railways and postal departments. By comparison, the number of central government employees stands at about 50 lakh.The size of the pension increase will majorly depend on the fitment factor, the multiplier used to revise salaries and pensions under each pay commission. In the 7th Pay Commission, this factor was fixed at 2.57, resulting in basic pay being raised to 2.57 times the earlier amount under the 6th Pay Commission.The fitment factor for the 8th Pay Commission will only be confirmed after the Union Cabinet approves the commission’s recommendations.Manjeet Singh Patel, National President of the All India NPS Employees Federation, said that while everyone talks about the fitment factor, pensioners want other long-pending issues corrected as well.""A high fitment factor means a higher pension hike. But there are two key areas we want the government to fulfil. One is on commutation of salary. As per the current rules, if pensioners opt for a 40% pension commutation, they get reduced pension for 15 years. We want the government to reduce it to 12 years,” he told ET.He adds that medical support under CGHS remains inadequate in many places.""Plus, there are a lot of areas where CGHS hospitals are not available and pensioners get a fixed Rs 3,000/month for their medical benefits. We feel for an aged person, it's a meagre amount and it should be increased to Rs 20,000. More hospitals at the district level should also be brought under the CGHS service,"" Patel says.The fitment factor is a multiplier used when pay scales are revised. Under the 7th Pay Commission, it was 2.57, meaning basic pay increased 2.57 times.Ramachandran Krishnamoorthy, Director – Payroll Services, Nexdigm, explains that the same logic applies to pensions. For example, if the basic pay was Rs 10,000 earlier, in the 7th CPC matrix it became Rs 25,700 after applying the factor. A higher multiplier under the 8th CPC automatically pushes up pensions, according to ET.Illustration of basic pension changes:In another example, if the existing basic pension is Rs 25,000 and the fitment factor becomes 2.0, the new basic pension becomes Rs 50,000: Rs 25,000 × 2 = Rs 50,000Whenever the basic pension rises, Dearness Relief also goes up because it is calculated as a percentage of the revised pension.EPS, family pension and enhanced pension are similarly affected.Family pension (typically 30% of pension for central government pensioners) also increases in line with the new basic.Pension is treated as income from salary under the Income Tax Act. Once the 8th CPC increases the pension amount, the taxable income rises too.","The size of the pension increase will majorly depend on the fitment factor, the multiplier used to revise salaries and pensions under each pay commission.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Meet the 22-Year-Old Indian-Origin Founders Who Just Became the World’s Youngest Billionaires





In a stunning testament to the boom in Artificial Intelligence (AI), three 22-year-old high school friends from Silicon Valley, including two Indian-Americans, have become the world's youngest self-made billionaires.Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, co-founders of the San Francisco-based AI recruiting platform Mercor, achieved the staggering feat after their company recently secured $350 million in funding, valuing the firm at $10 billion. This milestone dethrones Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, who became a billionaire at 23.The $10 billion valuation gives each of the three founders, who hold roughly 22 percent stakes, a net worth exceeding $2 billion. Foody is the CEO of the company; Hiremath, whose parents emigrated from Karnataka, is the CTO; and Midha, whose parents emigrated from New Delhi, is the board chairman.The trio's journey began at Bellarmine College Preparatory, an all-boys Jesuit school in San Jose, where they bonded over late-night preparations for national debate tournaments. The skills they honed—rapid-fire analysis and persuasive logic—would later become the bedrock of their entrepreneurial success.""We were always arguing about the future of work,"" Foody recalled in a recent Forbes interview.After high school, the friends scattered to elite universities: Foody to Georgetown for economics, Hiremath to Harvard for computer science, and Midha to Georgetown for foreign service, before they were reunited by the start-up siren call of Silicon Valley.In early 2023, during their sophomore years, they launched Mercor even while they were apart. The initial idea was simple: an online freelance marketplace to bridge the talent gap by connecting skilled software engineers in India -- where coders are plentiful -- with cash-strapped U.S. startups hungry for remote help. However, it quickly pivoted, fueled by the explosive demand for ""human-in-the-loop"" services needed to refine foundational AI models like ChatGPT.Evolding into an AI-powered platform that automates recruitment while delivering a global network of vetted contractors, Mercor now boasts over 30,000 specialists worldwide -- in fields ranging from law and medicine to finance and engineering -- who are paid to label data, simulate scenarios, and inject the nuanced human judgment algorithms cannot replicate. Clients, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and six of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants, use the platform to source the talent needed to turn raw compute into smarter AI.The lean operation is run by a 30-person team whose median age is just 22. Hiremath's 2035 vision for Mercor is to have built a unified global labor marketplace, matching every person to every job or task in a seamless way.The company’s growth has been dizzying. By mid-2024, Mercor hit a $500 million in annualized revenue, up from $100 million just months earlier. The founders, all recipients of the Thiel Fellowship's $100,000 grant for skipping college, accelerated their funding rounds at a breakneck pace. A $32 million Series A in September 2024 valued them at $250 million, and a $100 million Series B in February 2025 sent the valuation soaring to $2 billion, leading VC-watchers to call it the fastest growing start-up in Silicon Valley.The final turbocharge came this summer: a $14.3 billion acquisition of Mercor's main rival, Scale AI, by Meta paved the way for even faster growth for the upstart start-up. Wary of conflicts, major AI labs like OpenAI and DeepMind turned en masse to Mercor for a neutral alternative. Another $350 million Series C infusion this week bumped them into the billionaire’s club, based on Mercor’s valuation.","Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, co-founders of the San Francisco-based AI recruiting platform Mercor, achieved the staggering feat after their company recently secured $350 million in funding.

Green sparkles: EVs hit record numbers in October,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/green-sparkles-evs-hit-record-numbers-in-october/articleshow/125073050.cms,"



CHENNAI: The festive month of Oct proved to be nothing short of impressive for India's electric vehicle (EV) industry. Total EV registrations reached an all-time high, with every segment of battery-powered vehicles experiencing positive growth. Electric two-wheelers alone raced past the one-million-unit milestone for the calendar year - with two months still to go.This growth across EV categories came amid concerns over a possible loss of momentum in EV volumes due to production challenges arising from magnet availability issues and the recent GST rate cut for ICE vehicles, which reduced the price gap between the two segments.Total EV registrations (including all segments of battery-operated vehicles) stood at about 2.34 lakh units - the highest-ever monthly registrations recorded to date. The growth was about 5% year-on-year and 27% sequentially.Oct also proved to be a record month for the electric two-wheeler (E2W) segment, which reported its highest monthly volumes to date at 1.44 lakh units, up 3% y-o-y and 37% m-o-m, supported by the festive season and renewed retail traction. The electric passenger vehicle segment (including e-cars and e-SUVs) also reported a surge in volumes amid the reduced price gap between EVs and ICEs.Total registrations stood at 17,874 units, compared with 11,428 units in Oct 2024 and 16,346 units in Sept this year.Electric three-wheelers (excluding e-rickshaws) grew to 70,604 units, compared with 67,173 units in Oct 2024 and 61,044 units in Sept this year.In the electric two-wheeler segment, Bajaj Auto emerged as the leader with sales of 31,207 units (up from 19,689 units in Sept), followed by TVS Motor with 29,494 units (up from 22,665 units) and Ather with 28,082 units (up from 18,297 units).

Investor pressure not reason for our IPO: Pine Labs CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/investor-pressure-not-reason-for-our-ipo-pine-labs-ceo/articleshow/125072856.cms,"IPO





MUMBAI: As Pine Labs broadens its international play and expands in a competitive space where technology is fast nudging firms to evolve, going public will allow it to establish value for the company and gain wider credibility, said B Amrish Rau, chairman, MD and CEO at the fintech which is set to debut on the exchanges later this month, joining a batch of startups heading to Dalal Street.The Peak XV Partners and Temasek backed startup said that there was no investor pressure for the company to launch an IPO. Besides, the public markets ecosystem is very supportive, enabling more startups to take the IPO route for growth, Rau said. A public listing allows investors to seek partial or total exit, making money on their investments. ""Investor pressure is not the reason for our IPO. Once a company is listed, it gets a lot of investor confidence and it gives value to their stock,"" Rau said in an interview.At the upper end of the price band set at Rs 221 per share, the IPO is sized at Rs 3,900 crore and the implied valuation of the company is pegged at Rs 25,377 crore (about $2.9 billion), over 40% lower than its last funding valuation of $5 billion. Pine Labs, it is understood, was initially targeting an IPO valuation of up to $6 billion-Rau did not directly comment on the valuation but said the company wanted to ensure wider investor participation.""We will price ourselves in such a way where the village feels happy about this IPO which is going out from their community,"" Rau said.Of the total offer size, Rs 2,080 crore will be raised through a fresh issue of shares while a clutch of shareholders including PayPal, Mastercard, Peak XV and Temasek will get Rs 1,820 crore by selling some portions of their stakes. Pine Labs has pared the size of its IPO which opens for bidding on Nov 7 amid a rush of new age IPOs in the market.Earlier, the company was looking to raise Rs 2,600 crore through fresh issue of shares while investors are now selling 8.2 crore shares as part of the offer for sale (OFS) component against 14.7 crore shares listed in the draft IPO papers. ""I got support from the board and existing investors, they said they want to sell less,"" said Rau, who is gearing up to face more scrutiny and competition as Pine Labs goes public. Founded in 1998, the company has grown from a card payments processor to build businesses across prepaid cards, UPI and online payments.""Over the last few months, talking to global investors and Indian mutual funds, I can safely say that most of them are looking for interesting stories and companies. Investors and analysts are spending time to understand the nuances of our business. The ecosystem is very supportive for new age startups to bring their companies to IPOs,"" Rau said.","The Peak XV Partners and Temasek backed startup said that there was no investor pressure for the company to launch an IPO.

BENGALURU: The Supreme Court has rejected petitions filed by Think & Learn, the parent of Byju's, and its US-based lender GLAS Trust Company, giving its subsidiary Aakash Educational Services (AESL) the green signal to proceed with its planned rights issue and raise funds.The dismissal of the civil appeals upholds the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's (NCLAT) order from last week, which rejected GLAS's plea to halt AESL's rights issue. The verdict clears the way for Aakash to move ahead with the rights issue, a step that will reduce Byju's stake in the company from 25.7% to below 5%.Sanjay Garg, Head - Legal at AESL, said, ""We welcome the Hon'ble Supreme Court's dismissal of the Civil Appeals filed by GLAS Trust and the RP, which sought to misuse insolvency proceedings to disrupt this legacy. This judgment reaffirms the strength of our position and upholds the integrity of the legal process.""The dispute follows a series of transactions that led to the Manipal Group acquiring a controlling stake in AESL. Byju's acquired AESL in 2021 in a deal valued at around $1 billion. The conflict stems from insolvency proceedings initiated against Think & Learn before the NCLT in Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: Cyclone Montha, brewing over the Arabian Sea, is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm and make landfall along the Andhra Pradesh coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam, near Kakinada, by Tuesday evening, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The name Montha meaning “beautiful” or “fragrant flower” was suggested by Thailand, one of the 13 member countries of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and UN ESCAP panel that governs cyclone naming in the North Indian Ocean region. Each name is used only once and never repeated.In the North Indian Ocean, which includes the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, cyclone naming is managed by the WMO/ESCAP Panel on Tropical Cyclones. This panel includes 13 countries: India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Oman, Yemen, Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.Each member submits a list of names that reflect their culture, language, or natural environment. The names are then used sequentially whenever a new cyclone reaches the intensity required to be officially named by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which acts as the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for this region.Each country has submitted 13 names, forming a list of 169 names used sequentially and alphabetically. Names are neutral to gender, politics, and religion. The first cyclone of this season, Shakhti, suggested by Sri Lanka, formed earlier this month in the Arabian Sea but spared the Indian coast.The cyclone is likely to bring heavy rain across Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Tamil Nadu with red alerts issued for several coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh.After Montha, the next cyclones will be named Senyar (UAE), Ditwah (Yemen), Arnab (Bangladesh), and Murasu (India). The naming system began in 2004, following a decision by the WMO and ESCAP in 2000, to make communication about tropical storms simpler and more effective for public awareness and disaster management.","Cyclone Montha, brewing over the Arabian Sea, is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm by October 28.

Trump, Xi Defuse Tariff Time Bomb? U.S. & China Edge Towards Ending Trade War | Global Pulse





WASHINGTON: When Neal Katyal walks up to the nine US Supreme Court justices on Wednesday morning, he will be arguing a case that even US President Donald Trump has said is “one of the most important in the History of the Country.” So critical that Trump himself had said he would personally be in the court before deciding not to because “I do not want to distract from the importance of the decision. ”The 54-year old Indian-American attorney is the lead counsel for plaintiffs in the landmark case that will decide whether the U.S President has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), or whether, as Katyal will assert, the power of taxation and tariffs rests with Congress. “It will be, in my opinion, one of the most important and consequential Decisions ever made by the United States Supreme Court. If we win, we will be the Richest, Most Secure Country anywhere in the World, BY FAR. If we lose, our Country could be reduced to almost Third World status — Pray to God that that doesn’t happen!” Trump said on Sunday.On his part, Katyal will pray before the court that it uphold the decision he won before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ,where he represented the Liberty Justice Center to secure a 7-4 ruling that said the President lacked the authority to impose sweeping tariffs.Indicative of the importance of the case, the arguments before the SC are scheduled to last for an extended period of 80 minutes, which is longer than the standard 60 minutes for cases. The courtroom is expected to be packed, with the eyes of not just Americans but the entire world glued to the proceedings.Katyal is not new to the limelight. A celebrated attorney who has argued more than 50 cases before the Supreme Court, going back to 2000 when he was co-counsel for vice-president Al Gore in the Bush v Gore case, he is a familiar figure in American legal circles, and in the eyes of many, a “Trump tormentor.” From challenging the Trump administration's travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries during its first term to arguing against the White House's efforts to expedite deportation efforts, he has been a thorn in the administration’s side, lacing his record in courts with trenchant commentaries on MSNBC.Son of a physician mom and engineer dad who emigrated from India, the Chicago-born Katyal attended Yale Law School, where he was mentored by Akhil Amar, an Indian-American US Constitutional Law legend. While Neal's sister Sonia Katyal is a Professor of Law and co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology at UC Berkeley, Akhil Amar's brother Vikram Amar was the Dean of University of Illinois College of Law and is currently a Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of California law school.In fact, the tariff case against Trump also involves another Indian-American attorney, Pratik Shah, who is head of Akin Gump's Supreme Court and Appellate practice, and was the lead counsel Learning Resources and hand2mind, two educational toy companies that have also challenged the presidential authority under IEEPA. The Supreme Court consolidated all the cases for Wednesday’s hearing, and according to the SCOTUS blog, Katyal won the right to make the arguments after a coin toss.",Indian-American attorney Neal Katyal is the lead counsel for plaintiffs in the landmark case.

The art of misdeal: How Donald Trump’s China tariff backfired on US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-tariff-on-china-xi-jinping-us-china-trade-deal-trump-tariff-war/articleshow/125061271.cms,"Trump, Xi Defuse Tariff Time Bomb? U.S. & China Edge Towards Ending Trade War | Global Pulse

Why it matters

The core goal of Trump’s trade agenda - to weaken China’s manufacturing clout and revive US industry - is increasingly out of reach. His chaotic tariff strategy is backfiring, driving small companies back into China’s arms and reinforcing the very dependency he promised to end.

“I’m not going to spend any more energy trying to get out of China,” Travis McMaster, a Washington-based importer who was forced to abandon plans to shift production to India after Trump raised tariffs there, told the New York Times.

Instead of creating incentives to diversify, Trump’s tariff flip-flops are eroding trust in the US as a stable economic partner. Meanwhile, China is playing a longer game - and winning.

Between the lines

The big picture

1. China has mastered Trump’s playbook.

2. Rare earths are Beijing’s ace.

3. Trump’s allies are getting punished.

Zoom in: America’s broken tariff math

Average Trump-era tariff on Chinese goods: 47.6%

Tariffs on India & Brazil: Up to 50%

Tariff on Canada (fentanyl-related): 35%

China's fentanyl tariff: Cut to 10%

The numbers

$1bn/day: China’s current rate of exports to the US, despite tariffs

25M tons: China’s new annual soybean commitment under the deal - still less than pre-trade war levels

34%: Rise in China’s stock market this year, compared to ~17% for the S&P 500

3x: US reliance on Chinese inputs vs China’s on American ones, according to economist Richard Baldwin

How China is winning

What they’re saying

“Ten percent isn’t quite enough to move the needle,” said Cameron Johnson, a Shanghai-based supply chain expert. “You’re not going to move your factory or production for six months and a 10% reduction.”(NYT)

“China is playing chess while the US plays tic-tac-toe,” said a person close to the negotiations.(AP)

“They’ve shown themselves to be an unreliable partner... and they have the sword over us,” Bessent said.(CNN)

“They are sending a message that it’s time for payback,” said Sean Stein, referring to China’s rare-earth licensing scheme. (Economist)

What’s next

The bottom line

Trump's tariff policy, framed as a crusade to “decouple” from China, has produced a paradox: it’s tying US supply chains more tightly to Beijing, not less.

It has empowered China to weaponize rare earths, rewrite global trade norms, and test American resolve - all while appearing cooperative on paper.

And for American workers, farmers, and manufacturers - the collateral damage continues to pile up.

Trump claimed the trade war would be a “big win” for American manufacturing. But by almost every measure, China is stronger now than when he started.

Trump may have won headlines. Xi won leverage.





US President Donald Trump’s latest “deal” with China is doing more for Beijing than it is for Washington. In a bid to de-escalate a spiraling trade war, Trump agreed to halve a 20% fentanyl-related tariff and delay major sanctions on Chinese firms - while simultaneously raising tariffs on allies like Canada.The effect: China is walking away with cheaper access to US markets, looser restrictions on rare-earth exports, and less pressure to overhaul its manufacturing dominance - while American businesses and workers pay the price.Despite fiery rhetoric, Trump’s actions tell a different story.•Chinese goods now face lower or similar tariffs compared to imports from key US allies.•Beijing’s rare-earth chokehold remains intact, even as Trump touts “deals” to ease export restrictions.•The promise to decouple has, in practice, slowed: American businesses are hedging less, not more.“Contrary to what many in the administration are saying, they haven’t ended up with a tariff structure that really encourages relocation out of China,” Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations told the NYT.In fact, as Sean Stein of the US-China Business Council puts it, the deal has only reaffirmed China’s place as the world’s factory: “In no place has it been possible to replicate the manufacturing ecosystem and cost efficiencies that you get in China.”This is not just about tariffs. It's about who sets the rules of global trade - and right now, China is taking control.From soybeans to semiconductors, Beijing has learned how to retaliate with precision.“We just won’t tolerate the US hitting us anymore, and we believe we have the capability to fight back,” Tu Xinquan, a Beijing trade expert, told the Economist.•When Trump threatened Chinese shipping with 100% tariffs, China imposed port fees of its own.•When the US sanctioned Chinese chipmakers, Beijing launched sweeping antitrust probes into Nvidia, Qualcomm, and others.•And when Trump leaned on tariffs to force fentanyl concessions, China offered limited cooperation in exchange for massive tariff relief.China controls over 85% of the world’s refined rare earths - vital for everything from smartphones to fighter jets. Its recent licensing regime allows it to decide who can make what and where.Trump backed down from a 100% tariff after Beijing signaled it would stop shipments entirely - potentially paralyzing American auto and tech industries.Trump imposed higher tariffs on Indian and Brazilian goods than on Chinese ones.Even Canada, America's closest ally, is facing a 35% nominal tariff - higher than China’s 10% fentanyl rate. Switzerland? Hit with 39%, mostly over gold imports. Meanwhile, China got relief in return for vague promises to buy soybeans and slow fentanyl exports.Even Britain and Australia - longtime US allies - are now hit with a 10% “reciprocal” tariff.This mishmash of penalties has created economic uncertainty that punishes friends more than foes and does little to reduce America's $300 billion trade deficit with China.President Xi Jinping has shown China can resist American coercion while answering in ways that deter escalation. China’s targeted responses-from export restrictions on critical inputs to countermeasures on shipping-have exposed the limits of sweeping US embargo threats that would also harm the American economy.Through trial and error, China is assembling a new framework for global trade that competes with tariff-centric strategies. It has redirected exports toward non-US markets while tightening control over chokepoint industries such as rare earths, using licensing-style leverage reminiscent of America’s semiconductor oversight-but sharper. As the largest trading partner for dozens of countries, China is using its manufacturing depth and market reach to set de facto rules that others must navigate, a report in the Economist said.Rather than weakening the leadership, the trade war has galvanized support for Xi Jinping ’s push to insulate critical supply chains and accelerate advanced manufacturing. Despite formidable internal challenges-from property-sector strain to subdued consumption-the confrontation has validated a long-running plan to become a techno-industrial powerhouse, the Economist report said.The tariff ceasefire is temporary. The rare-earth reprieve is for one year. Trump has hinted he’ll reimpose tariffs or add software export bans if China doesn't “keep its promises.”Trump is also expected to meet with Xi Jinping in China early next year. Analysts warn that without a durable framework, the trade rollercoaster could lurch into another round of escalation.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Donald Trump’s latest “deal” with China is doing more for Beijing than it is for Washington.

The announcement comes shortly after the Redmond-based company reported an 18% rise in quarterly sales to $77.7 billion, surpassing Wall Street estimates. The results, however, also drew attention to Microsoft’s massive investments in cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities.During the July–September quarter, Microsoft spent nearly $35 billion on capital expenditures, almost half of which went toward acquiring computer chips, with the rest allocated to data centre real estate and related infrastructure.“IREN’s expertise in building and operating a fully integrated AI cloud, from data centres to GPU stack, combined with their secured power capacity makes them a strategic partner,” said Jonathan Tinter, Microsoft’s president of business development and ventures, in a statement.“This collaboration unlocks new growth opportunities for both companies and the customers we serve.”The partnership comes amid Microsoft’s broader push to expand its AI footprint.

Gold stayed close to the $4,000-an-ounce mark on Monday, recovering from early losses after China moved to limit a tax rebate that has long benefited the country’s retailers and jewellery makers.The metal initially slipped by as much as 1% in Asian trading, but later regained ground, with bullion for immediate delivery up 0.2%, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, spot gold was trading near $4,012 an ounce in London at 8:27 a.m.The recovery comes after Beijing revealed on Saturday that it would stop allowing certain retailers to fully offset the value-added tax (VAT) on gold sourced from the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) and the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE).The announcement triggered a swift market reaction, especially in Hong Kong and mainland China, where jewellery counters bore the brunt.Under the new rules, producers of non-investment gold, items used in jewellery or industries such as electronics, can now deduct only 6% of VAT instead of the previous 13%. Businesses that aren’t members of the SGE or SHFE will face the same limits when selling investment-grade gold, including bars.The change quickly led to a rout in jewellery stocks. Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. slid as much as 12% in Hong Kong, Chow Sang Sang Holdings International Ltd. fell more than 8%, and Laopu Gold Co. lost more than 9%.Analysts at Citigroup Inc., including Tiffany Feng, noted that the adjustment is “likely to see the entire industry raise prices to pass through the cost pressure,” according to Bloomberg.Despite the turbulence, investor appetite for the metal remains strong. Gold touched an all-time high in October after a burst of retail buying, and although it has since eased, prices are still more than 50% higher since the start of the year. Core factors that have powered the rally — including buying by central banks and safe-haven inflows — remain present.“The tax changes in gold’s heaviest consumer nation will dent global sentiment,” said Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault. However, he added that the recovery seen in London trading on Monday, following weakness earlier in Asia, indicates that bullish sentiment towards gold is still firm.Elsewhere in the precious metals market, platinum climbed as much as 2.2%, while silver and palladium also posted small gains.","Spot gold was trading near $4,012 an ounce in London at 8:27 a.m. The recovery comes after Beijing revealed on Saturday that it would stop allowing certain retailers to fully offset the value-added tax (VAT) on gold sourced from the Shanghai Gold Exchange.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125052495,imgsize-77120,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

US treasury secretary Scott Bessent once again criticised China’s rare earth export controls, saying the United States and its allies are now moving at “warp speed” to build independent supply chains and reduce reliance on Beijing.Speaking to CNN, Bessent said that China’s strategy had been in motion for decades and accused the previous US governments of failing to respond in time.“I think it's naive for the Wall Street Journal editorial board, who I call a bunch of grumpy old men, to think that the Chinese weren't going to roll out these rare earth restrictions. They've been putting this plan together for 25, 30 years, and the US has been asleep at the switch,” he said.He stressed that the Biden administration is accelerating efforts to counter China’s leverage.“And now this administration, we're going to go at warp speed over the next 1-2 years, and we're going to get out from under the this sword that the Chinese have over us, and they have it over the whole world. And this time, we have rallied the allies.”He further added that now countries are going to reduce their reliance on Chinese rare earths.“And so it is going to be a all the Western democracies, the Asian democracies, and India are also going to join us in this, in trying to form our own supply chains. We don't want to decouple from China, but we need to de risk they've shown themselves to be an unreliable partner in many areas.”In October, China introduced new export restrictions on rare earths, minerals crucial for defence systems, electric vehicles and consumer electronics.The move triggered immediate alarm in Washington and among global manufacturers, with access to these materials seen as critical to national security and advanced technology supply chains.Bessent had earlier described the decision as a strategic error by Beijing. In comments published by the Financial Times, he said China’s action sent a warning signal to governments worldwide, “China has alerted everyone to the danger. They’ve made a real mistake.”Referring to the impact of Beijing’s move on trade and supply chains, he added, “It's one thing to put the gun on the table. It's another thing to fire shots in the air.”The restrictions briefly slowed shipments and unsettled rare-earth–dependent industries, emerging as a new flashpoint in US–China trade relations.Now, China has agreed to pause some of its export restrictions after high-level talks between President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea this week. Beijing announced that it would suspend certain export limits, including those involving rare-earth materials, for one year.According to US treasury secretary Scott Bessent, the recent episode may discourage China from taking similar action again.Bessent added that China may not have anticipated the scale of the reaction triggered by its export limits.“I think the Chinese leadership were slightly alarmed by the global backlash to their export controls,” Bessent said.",US treasury secretary Scott Bessent once again criticised China’s rare earth export controls.

Britons earning more than £46,000 (₹5,372,000 or $60,398) a year could face higher taxes under Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ upcoming Budget, according to reports.The Labour government is reportedly considering measures that would spare what it calls “working people” — those earning up to £45,000 — from tax rises, while targeting higher earners to plug gaps in public finances. The Daily Mail said the Treasury may define “working people” as those in the bottom two-thirds of the income scale.Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged not to raise income tax, VAT or National Insurance for ordinary workers, but refused this week to rule out hikes to those taxes for others.Tory Shadow Business Secretary Andrew Griffith accused Reeves of planning to “further massacre the take-home pay of millions of hard-working middle earners,” telling the Express: “While boosting the pay of their union paymasters, Labour don't understand or care about those who get up and work hard to make a better life.”The November 26 Budget — Reeves’ first full fiscal statement since Labour took power — is expected to outline measures to fund the government’s investment plans while meeting its fiscal rules.Other options reportedly under review include cutting pension perks for high earners and imposing a 20% “exit tax” on Britons who move abroad to avoid UK taxes — a proposal that could raise around £2 billion.A Treasury spokesperson declined to comment on the reports, saying: “We do not comment on speculation around tax changes outside of fiscal events.”Starmer told MPs this week: “The Budget is on the 26th of November and we will lay out our plans.”","Britons earning more than £46,000 could face higher taxes under Chancellor Rachel Reeves' upcoming Budget.

One-on-one with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent





US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has admitted that parts of the American economy are already in recession, blaming the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies for the slowdown while urging it to accelerate rate cuts.Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, Bessent said the economy was in a “transition period” following post-pandemic inflation and government spending cuts under the Trump administration.“I think that we are in good shape, but I think that there are sectors of the economy that are in recession,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “The Fed has caused a lot of distributional problems with their policies.” He cited the housing market as the clearest example, saying, “If the Fed brings down mortgage rates, they can end this housing recession.”Bessent pointed out that high interest rates had pushed the housing market into a prolonged slump, particularly hurting lower-income Americans. “If we are contracting spending, then I would think inflation would be dropping. If inflation is dropping, then the Fed should be cutting rates,” he said, adding that the administration’s reduced government expenditure had already helped bring the deficit-to-GDP ratio down from 6.4% to 5.9%.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently hinted that no further cuts were expected at the December meeting, drawing criticism from Bessent and other Trump officials. Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who also serves as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, warned in a *New York Times* interview that “if you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession. ”Data from Redfin shows the number of US homes changing hands has fallen to its lowest level in nearly 30 years, with only 28 out of every 1,000 homes sold between January and September. Redfin’s chief economist Daryl Fairweather called the situation “not healthy for the economy,” noting that “if people are stuck, it’s reflective of how the economy is stuck.”Meanwhile, the labour market has shown signs of weakness, with US employers adding just 22,000 jobs in August and the private sector losing 32,000 in September, according to ADP data. As companies like Microsoft, Amazon and General Motors announce job cuts, consumer confidence continues to fall — further dampening home sales and deepening concerns about the economy’s trajectory.At the centre of it all, Bessent’s message to the Federal Reserve was clear: ease rates soon or risk deepening the recession already gripping key sectors.","US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has admitted that parts of the economy are already in recession.

Market movement: Berkshire Hathaway offloads $6 billion in stocks; global markets read caution signal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-movement-berkshire-hathaway-offloads-6-billion-in-stocks-global-markets-read-caution-signal/articleshow/125049186.cms,"



Berkshire Hathaway is holding on to more cash than ever, highlighting a cautious stance in the equity markets even as the company posts strong quarterly earnings.The conglomerate, led by Warren Buffett, reported that its cash balance has reached $381.7 billion, the highest in the firm’s history. The figure swelled further after the company continued to offload shares instead of buying them.In the quarter ending September, Berkshire sold around $12.4 billion worth of stocks and bought approximately $6.4 billion, according to Barron’s. At present, Berkshire’s equity portfolio is valued at roughly $283 billion.The activity made the company a net seller by $6 billion for the period, extending a pattern first seen in early 2022. It marks the 12th consecutive quarter in which Berkshire has sold more stocks than it has purchased, ET reported.Despite Buffett’s position as one of the most prominent advocates of long-term investing, the firm has now spent three years reducing its equity exposure. The last time Berkshire held a similar level of cash was during the early stages of the pandemic, when global markets were unstable.The cautious stance is also visible in the company’s decision to avoid buybacks.Berkshire has not repurchased any of its own shares for five consecutive quarters, a notable shift given that buybacks had long served as a preferred method for deploying excess capital.As James Shanahan of Edward Jones told Reuters, ""If you feel like stocks are expensive, including your own shares, you’re eventually going to be right, but you can be wrong for a long time.""However, even with the conservative investment approach, Berkshire delivered strong results. Operating profit increased 34% from the same quarter last year to $13.49 billion, and net income rose 17% to $30.8 billion, helped by lower insurance losses and currency gains.Performance across Berkshire’s operating companies varied. Geico reported an increase in costs, likely tied to higher advertising spending. BNSF, the group’s railroad arm, reported a 6% rise in profit driven by lower fuel prices and improved efficiency.Meanwhile, the energy business posted a 9% decline in profit because of wildfire-related legal expenses and cost overruns involving its utilities segment.Berkshire Hathaway’s recent moves in cash and stock holdings are being watched for hints about its market outlook. The company still holds a few major investments that have produced strong returns, keeping its roughly $283-billion equity portfolio focused on those names. But its continued selling suggests Buffett’s team isn’t finding many good deals in the current market rally, especially with high US interest rates and uneven earnings growth.According to an ET report, this quarter comes at a turning point for Berkshire. Buffett, now 95, is preparing to hand over the CEO position at year-end to Greg Abel, the company’s vice chairman. Buffett will remain as chairman. Abel, 63, will inherit a vast cash reserve and the responsibility of deciding how to deploy it.One of the few recent major transactions was Berkshire’s commitment of $9.7 billion to purchase Occidental Petroleum’s chemical unit. The large outlay has not eased questions over how the rest of the cash pile will be used. Some investors have speculated about the possibility of Berkshire paying a dividend for the first time since 1967, but the company has offered no confirmation.","Berkshire Hathaway reported its cash balance has reached $381.7 billion, the highest in the firm's history.

The agreement fell within broad expectations, though questions remain over whether the ceasefire will hold for the entire duration.Currency markets reflected a shift in tone from the US Federal Reserve. The dollar held near a three-month high after several Fed regional presidents publicly expressed discomfort with the recent rate cut. In contrast, Governor Christopher Waller backed further easing, saying additional support may be needed for a labour market showing signs of losing momentum.At last week’s monetary policy meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a rate cut at the December meeting was ""not a foregone conclusion,"" Reuters reported.Until then, traders had treated a December cut as almost guaranteed. Market pricing now reflects a 68% chance of that move, sharply lower than before the meeting, when expectations were near certainty. The central bank lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, in line with forecasts.The shift helped keep the dollar elevated. The euro was last trading at $1.1524, around a three-month low. Sterling slipped 0.27% to $1.3134, while the yen traded at 154.175 per dollar, close to its weakest level since mid-February.In commodities, gold prices softened again, extending their retreat from last month’s record highs. Oil prices moved higher after OPEC+ decided not to increase production in the first quarter of next year, easing concerns about an oversupply.","Hong Kong's HSI jumped to 26,043, adding 136 points or 0.53%.

Trump warns of economic collapse: What if Supreme Court strikes down tariffs?

‘One of the most important cases’



Massive tax collection—$100 billion mark reached?







US President Donald Trump has warned that the American economy could face severe damage if the Supreme Court overturns his tariff policy.In an interview at CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Trump was asked what will happen if US Supreme Court invalidates tariffs.""“I think our country will be immeasurably hurt. I think our economy will go to hell. Look, because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we've ever had,"" he answered.The US President further added, “because of tariffs, 401ks at the highest level, and this is millions and millions of people that we've ever had, 401ks. I think it's the most important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in 100 years.”The interview, conducted at Mar-a-Lago by Norah O’Donnell on Friday and published on Sunday (local time), marks Trump’s first appearance on the programme since he settled a $16 million lawsuit with CBS News earlier this year. CBS has not disclosed how the interview came about or whether any specific terms were set ahead of filming. Although O’Donnell is a former “CBS Evening News” anchor, she is not part of the regular “60 Minutes” correspondent line-up.Trump’s remarks come just days before the Supreme Court begins hearing a case which he has described as “one of the most important cases in the history of our country.”The proceedings will examine whether he had the legal authority to introduce broad tariff measures, with the challenge focused on his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as the basis for imposing the import taxes, CNN reported.Earlier this year, Trump used those emergency powers to push tariffs up to 50% on countries such as India and Brazil, and as high as 145% on China, measures that underpin his economic agenda.US Customs and Border Patrol data, cited by CNN shows that, as of September 23, American companies have paid close to $90 billion to cover the tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).That figure represents more than half of all tariff revenue collected by the US government in the 2025 fiscal year, which closed on September 30.Earlier, in an interview with Fox Business, Trump acknowledged that a loss in court could force the administration to reverse course. He said that if the Supreme Court ruled against him, “we’d have to pay back money” and reimburse companies for the billions they have already paid.Trump has repeatedly promoted the tariff revenue as proof of his strategy’s success, describing the money flowing into federal accounts as historic. “We have a lot of money coming in, much more money than the country’s ever seen,” Trump had said earlier, referring to the revenue generated through tariffs.Figures from the US Treasury Department show that the government collected nearly $30 billion in tariff revenue in July, marking a 242% increase compared to the same period last year.Since April, when Trump introduced a 10% tariff on almost all imported goods, followed by additional increases, total tariff collections have reached $100 billion, which is three times the amount collected in the same four-month segment last year.",US President Donald Trump warns that the American economy could face severe damage if the Supreme Court overturns his tariff policy.

"Oil output move: Opec+ announces fresh 137,000 bpd hike from December; aims to protect market share amid US shale slowdown",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/oil-output-move-opec-announces-fresh-137000-bpd-hike-from-december-aims-to-protect-market-share-amid-us-shale-slowdown/articleshow/125037966.cms,"



The eight key members of the Opec+ alliance, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, have agreed to raise oil production by 137,000 barrels per day (bpd) starting December, marking a modest increase that will hold steady for three months, the group said in a statement after a virtual meeting on Sunday, AFP reported.The move, aligned with analyst expectations, represents a pause in the series of monthly hikes that began in April, as the group — known as the Voluntary Eight (V8) — seeks to consolidate market share amid steady oil prices and waning US shale output.Since April, the V8 — comprising Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman — has raised output by about 2.7 million bpd. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (Opec+) had accelerated production at an unexpectedly fast pace this year after years of supply cuts designed to bolster prices.Analysts see the latest move as a strategic effort to defend market position against US producers. “Supply by US shale producers is not increasing anymore, it’s going sideways,” said Ole Hvalbye, commodities analyst at SEB Bank, noting “less investment in new US production.”The V8 cited “low oil inventories” as justification for the output rise. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), US crude inventories have fallen sharply, keeping Brent crude prices steady near $65 per barrel.However, analysts warned that additional supply could pressure prices. “An increase in Opec+ quotas of 137,000 barrels would result in lower actual production, limiting the impact on prices,” said Emily Ashford of Standard Chartered Bank.Some members, including Russia, may face constraints due to overproduction in previous months. The latest US sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil have further clouded the outlook.“The market is underestimating what it means when you have US sanctions against two large Russian companies,” said Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of TotalEnergies, suggesting that potential supply disruptions could buoy prices.Yet, analysts cautioned that Russia’s ability to circumvent sanctions and China’s continued oil purchases may limit the overall impact of the US measures.","The eight key members of the Opec+ alliance, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, have agreed to raise oil production by 137,000 barrels per day starting December.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Saturday highlighted his country’s “progress” in building partnerships with India and other Asia-Pacific nations, even as tensions with the United States escalate over tariffs.His remarks came days after US President Donald Trump terminated all trade talks with Canada, accusing Ottawa of “egregious behaviour”, reported PTI.Speaking to reporters after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, Carney said, “There is no better place to build new partnerships than in the fastest growing part of the world that represents 60 per cent of the global economy.”Referring to developments in the region, he cited the free trade deal with Indonesia, ongoing talks with the Philippines and Thailand, and a “turning point” in relations with China.“Progress which we have been making with India… So I didn't meet directly with Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi here, (but) the foreign minister, other ministers have been meeting with India,” Carney said, adding that his government is focused on “reducing reliance on the United States” by diversifying trade partnerships.""That's what we're doing to build our strength at home, first and foremost. Build these partnerships abroad, reduce our reliance on the United States.It can't happen overnight, but we're moving very fast,” he added.Carney also apologised to President Trump earlier this week for an anti-tariff television advertisement released by Ontario’s provincial government.The ad, which reassembled excerpts from a 1987 speech by former US President Ronald Reagan, had prompted Trump to accuse Canada of interference and announce an additional 10% tariff on Canadian exports.Carney confirmed he apologised to Trump during a dinner at the APEC summit, saying, “It’s not something I would have done... and so I apologised to him.” He emphasised that trade relations are the federal government’s domain, not provincial leaders’.Carney’s comments follow Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand’s visit to India last month, during which both countries unveiled a roadmap to expand cooperation in trade, energy and critical minerals — part of efforts to restore ties strained by the 2023 killing of a Sikh separatist, reported PTI.Despite the diplomatic rift with Washington, Carney expressed optimism that trade talks could resume once conditions stabilise.",Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney highlighted his country’s “progress” in building partnerships with India and other Asia-Pacific nations.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

China-EU trade row: Beijing bans European firms from major medical bids; says Brussels must end ‘discriminatory’ practices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-eu-trade-row-beijing-bans-european-firms-from-major-medical-bids-says-brussels-must-end-discriminatory-practices/articleshow/122278665.cms,"Representative image

China on Sunday imposed a retaliatory ban on European companies bidding for large-scale medical equipment contracts, intensifying a simmering trade dispute with the European Union.The move comes just days after the EU restricted Chinese firms from participating in government medical device procurements over €5 million, citing Beijing's long-standing exclusion of European products from its public tenders.According to a statement by China’s finance ministry, EU-based firms, excluding those with established European capital operating within China, will now be barred from participating in Chinese public procurement orders exceeding 45 million yuan ($6.3 million), reportedThe ban covers an extensive range of products, including surgical instruments, medical machinery, and prosthetics.Additionally, Beijing has stipulated that for tenders involving non-European firms, the proportion of EU-origin products in their bids cannot exceed 50 per cent.This marks the latest salvo in escalating trade tensions between the two economic powers.While Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi made diplomatic visits to EU headquarters, France, and Germany last week to ease frictions, longstanding issues persist, notably the $357.1 billion trade deficit between the EU and China.The European Commission’s earlier restrictions on Chinese firms were justified as a response to what it described as “exclusionary and discriminatory measures” imposed by Beijing. Brussels claimed that nearly 90 per cent of medical procurement contracts in China systematically excluded EU products.China, in turn, criticised the EU’s move as a demonstration of “double standards” and insisted that it had expressed willingness to resolve disputes through dialogue. “China has repeatedly expressed, through bilateral dialogue, its willingness to resolve these disputes appropriately,” the commerce ministry said.This escalation follows recent frictions over electric vehicles and alcohol imports. On Saturday, Beijing began enforcing anti-dumping tariffs of up to 34.9 per cent on European brandy, mostly affecting French cognac makers, citing unfair pricing practices. Companies like Jas Hennessy, Remy Martin, and Martell face steep levies unless they adhere to agreed minimum price levels.French President Emmanuel Macron described China’s partial exemption of some firms as a “positive step,” though French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot warned that “several major issues remain unresolved,” particularly the exclusion of certain producers from the exemptions.The European Commission, however, continues to oppose Beijing’s actions, with trade spokesman Olof Gill stating, “We believe that China's measures are unfair... unjustified... and inconsistent with international rules.”The disputes over EVs, medical devices, and now brandy underscore a broader conflict around industrial subsidies and market access. China has maintained that its actions are a legitimate response to EU protectionism and has lodged complaints with the World Trade Organisation.With a China-EU summit scheduled for later this month to mark 50 years of diplomatic relations, hopes for resolution remain. However, Beijing may cancel the second day of the summit, as per Bloomberg.","EU-based firms will now be barred from participating in Chinese public procurement orders exceeding 45 million yuan ($6.3 million) Beijing has stipulated that for tenders involving non-European firms, the proportion of EU- origin products in their bids cannot exceed 50 per cent.

India is set to take over the Brics Chairship in January 2026.The finance ministry said the two leaders emphasised furthering South-South cooperation and acknowledged the warm ties between India and Brazil. Sitharaman noted that the two countries are “strategic partners” collaborating across sectors.Earlier, Sitharaman also addressed the board of governors of the New Development Bank (NDB), where she underlined the importance of collective and decisive action by the Global South amid global fiscal and geopolitical uncertainties.She said multilateral development banks (MDBs) like the NDB have a vital role in tackling emerging challenges by offering “technical expertise, concessional financing, and effective risk mitigation tools.”The minister concluded that India's growing global role, especially within multilateral frameworks like Brics and the NDB, will continue to focus on pragmatic cooperation and inclusive development, particularly for the Global South.","Nirmala Sitharaman held a series of high-level bilateral meetings with counterparts from Russia, China, Brazil and Indonesia in Rio de Janeiro.

"UAE rolls out new golden visa: Lifetime residency at Rs 23 lakh, India among first to benefit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/uae-rolls-out-new-golden-visa-lifetime-residency-at-rs-23-lakh-india-among-first-to-benefit/articleshow/122280940.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major shift from its traditional investment-based residency model, the United Arab Emirates has introduced a new nomination-based Golden Visa, offering eligible Indians lifetime residency in the country by paying a one-time fee of AED 1,00,000 (approximately Rs 23.3 lakh), without the need to invest in property or business.Until now, Indian nationals were eligible for the UAE's coveted Golden Visa primarily through high-value investments, including a minimum AED 2 million (Rs 4.66 crore) in property. But under this new system, applicants can be nominated and approved based on their professional background, societal contributions, or potential benefits to UAE’s sectors such as culture, trade, science, startups, or finance.The pilot phase of the initiative has been launched for India and Bangladesh, with over 5,000 Indian applicants expected in the first three months, according to officials involved in the process.Rayad Group, the consultancy firm selected to pilot the nomination-based Golden Visa in India, is leading the process in partnership with VFS and One Vasco centres across India and Bangladesh. Applications can also be submitted through the group’s online portal and call centre.""This is a golden opportunity for Indians,"" said Rayad Kamal Ayub, Managing Director of Rayad Group. He explained that the vetting process includes anti-money laundering checks, criminal background verification, and social media screening.The final nomination decision rests with UAE government authorities.Approved visa holders can bring family members, employ staff, and engage in business or professional activities. Unlike property-based visas, which lapse upon property sale, the nomination-based Golden Visa is permanent.This initiative reflects the UAE’s growing economic and strategic ties with India following the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) signed in 2022. The program is expected to expand to other CEPA partner countries, including China, in later phases.","The pilot phase of the initiative has been launched for India and Bangladesh.

"'Investors have faith in India, capex happening'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/investors-have-faith-in-india-capex-happening/articleshow/122284549.cms,"Rajiv Memani

Some numbers point to a slowdown in Q1. What is your assessment of current economic situation?

Tax incentives were

announced in Budget. Is there evidence of higher spends by consumers, especially middle class?

What about private

investment?

What is your expectation on US tariffs? Do you expect a deal?

How is industry bracing for tariff cuts as govt is working on multiple FTAs?

Rajiv Memani, chairman and CEO of consulting firm EY India has taken over as the new president of CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) at a critical juncture for India Inc. In an interview to TOI, Memani says the overall health of businesses is not bad and he expects a reasonably strong bounce-back in growth. Excerpts:There are some sectors where the growth has been good. Some sectors have been impacted in terms of profitability due to the geopolitical situation, the global trade-related uncertainty and the earlier onset of monsoons. But the overall health of businesses is not bad. Overall GST collection in the first quarter is still 11-12%, it's not bad. In the low-to-middle income segments in urban areas, there is some pressure. But outside of that it's okay. Rural consumption is becoming more robust. With lower interest rates, lower inflation, more crop sowing, there is expectation that the bounce-back should be reasonably strong and we should be looking at the GDP numbers that we had estimated.It is too early to say.The pattern of consumption is changing. So, sometimes traditional measures don't fully indicate where consumption is happening. People are spending much more on technology, much more on experiences than in traditional areas. But I am sure that in some form or shape consumption will increase whether it's in travel technology or in the traditional areas.Private investment has been growing. There's a general myth that private investments are not happening. It is happening. If you look at every data, after 2020, for a year or two before Covid and for a year or two after that it was slow. But from 2022-23 onwards private sector investments have picked up. There are three or four things, which are impacting decisions. One is global uncertainty; second, demand in some areas has not been as strong as anticipated, time taken for approvals for land, environmental clearances in states and lack of skilled manpower for large projects in newer areas. If I was planning a capex of, say, Rs 1,000 crore, given the uncertainty, I will probably reduce it to Rs 600-700 crore. But, the fundamental focus on growth, fundamental belief in India, strength in the balance sheet, seeing what's happening in the capital markets, lower interest rates, that will make investments come through.The engagement has been very intense. The level of detailing is very high. Not everyone is going to probably get the best deal. At an overall level, the industry would benefit and is keen to ensure that India enters into a bilateral trade agreement and not wait for 26% duty to come through.We are trying to see how we can mitigate the non-tariff barriers as part of the FTA talks. There are a lot of complementarities with the current set of countries with which FTAs are being signed. Indian industry is very clear that on an average duties could come down by 5-20%. If that is the gap, there has to be much more focus on competitiveness, including internal competitiveness through investment in R&D and other areas. The other is in terms of factors of production such as land, or energy, logistics and cost of capital. CII has set up a committee to address the issue of competitiveness.","Rajiv Memani, chairman and CEO of consulting firm EY India, has taken over as the new president of CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) In an interview to TOI, Memani says the overall health of businesses is not bad and he expects a reasonably strong bounce-back in growth.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122285803,imgsize-530112,width-400,resizemode-4/122285803.jpg"
Why Jane St ban may not hit trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-jane-st-ban-may-not-hit-trading/articleshow/122284536.cms,"SEBI

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi's Rs 4,850-crore disgorgement order against global algo-based trader Jane Street group and its temporary ban from Dalal Street - for market manipulation - is unlikely to deter proprietary (prop) firms from trading on domestic bourses. Rather, the clampdown is expected to improve compliance and corporate governance among brokerages and funds that trade with prop funds, market players said.Despite concerns about drop in futures & options volumes in the backdrop of the ban on the US-based foreign fund, Sebi remains steadfast about its stand about strict adherence to its rules by market participants and non-tolerance of any attempt of manipulation, its chairman said.One of the fallouts of the Sebi order was the sharp slide in the stock prices of some of the broking houses and market infra institutions that analysts feel would be affected by a drop in F&O volumes, at least in the short term.On Friday, the day after Sebi's order was released, Nuvama Wealth Management that also has a broking arm, lost over 11% while Angel One, another tech-heavy financial services firm with a robust broking outfit, lost nearly 6%.Among the institutions, BSE, the biggest among the listed bourses, closed 6.4% down while CDSL, the biggest depository, lost 2.3%.Angel One chairman & MD Dinesh Thakkar said, in an email, that over the past few years, retail participation in India's F&O segment had surged about 20 times, something that has fuelled liquidity, volatility, and opportunity. ""Proprietary trading desks thrive in such environments, leveraging high-frequency and algorithmic strategies. With millions of active retail traders and deepening institutional activity, India's market opportunity is structural and not cyclical. Also, this is not dependent on any one firm.""Sebi officials also feel that there should not be any major market impact from the enforcement action.""In the long run, the growth in market confidence, and a free and fair market, should aid responsible investing and capital formation,"" a Sebi source said.","Sebi's Rs 4,850-crore disgorgement order against global algo-based trader Jane Street group and its temporary ban from Dalal Street - for market manipulation - is unlikely to deter proprietary (prop) firms from trading on domestic bourses.

Most banks see muted loan growth in June quarter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/most-banks-see-muted-loan-growth-in-june-quarter/articleshow/122284532.cms,"MUMBAI: The banking sector saw a slowdown in the June quarter, with muted credit growth and uneven deposit performance, following a strong March-end push. HDFC Bank , the largest private lender, reported a 5.1% sequential rise in average deposits and a 0.4% increase in gross advances, joining some public sector banks in bucking the broader trend.The first quarter is typically seen as a lean period, with both loans and deposits moderating after the fiscal year-end surge. Despite the seasonality, Punjab National Bank and UCO Bank reported growth in business. PNB's global deposits rose 1.4% and advances 1.3% over the previous quarter, while UCO Bank saw deposits rise 1.7% and credit growth 2.3%.In contrast, Bank of Baroda posted a sequential drop of 2.5% in global deposits and 1.9% in advances. Yes Bank recorded declines of 3% and 2% in deposits and loans, respectively. IndusInd Bank and RBL Bank, both mid-sized private players, also reported lower deposits and advances compared to end-March levels.Year-on-year, several banks saw deposit growth surpass loan growth. HDFC Bank's deposits rose 16.2%, adding Rs 3.12 lakh crore, while advances grew 6.7%. The increase follows its strategy to bring down its credit deposit ratio after the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank. PNB also reported stronger growth in deposits than loans, at 12.1% versus 11.3%.For some PSU lenders with liquid resources, credit growth exceeded deposit accretion as they rejigged business to protect margins. Bank of Baroda's loans rose 12.4%, while deposits grew 9.7%. At Bank of India, advances increased 15.4% against 10.4% growth in deposits.

PSBs may remove min balance fines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/psbs-may-remove-min-balance-fines/articleshow/122284525.cms,"Savings a/c slowdown: PSBs may scrap min balance fines

MUMBAI: Public sector banks are reconsidering the need for customers to maintain minimum balances in savings accounts, following discussions with the finance ministry over the declining share of current and savings accounts in total deposits. Bank of Baroda , Punjab National Bank and Indian Bank have recently dropped this requirement, which means that customers who fail to maintain the minimum prescribed balance will not have to pay a penalty.In a recent meeting, finance ministry officials are understood to have questioned banks on the need to penalise customers who do not maintain minimum balance. The concern stemmed from the slowdown in low-cost current and savings account deposits.RBI in its financial stability report noted that ""banks' liability profile is changing with the share of higher-cost term deposits and CDs growing compared to low-cost current account and savings account (Casa) deposits""According to bankers, Jan Dhan data suggests that while many of these accounts were initially dormant, balances rose steadily. This experience appears to have influenced the policy shift.SBI was the first to eliminate minimum balance requirements in 2020.The move followed public criticism after an RTI revealed that penalties collected for non-maintenance of balances exceeded the bank's net profit, which had been offset by provisions for bad loans.Traditionally, public sector banks had lower balance requirements compared to private banks with the requirement waived for Jan Dhan accounts. Besides the mandatory exclusion of Jan Dhan accounts, private banks also waive minimum balance requirements on salary accounts and on those accounts where the customers maintain a threshold in terms of 'relationship value' which includes fixed deposits and other investments.Historically, banks have been using returns generated from low-interest savings accounts to cross-subsidise banking services which were provided free of charge. However, incremental costs for banks have reduced as most banking services are now provided through digital channels.The new approach is to recover the costs of maintaining accounts through other means - such as debit card fees and charges for transactions beyond free limits.","Public sector banks are reconsidering the need for customers to maintain minimum balances in savings accounts.

ITR Deadline Extension: What I-T Department Has Said

ITRs for Assessment Year 2025-26 feature significant modifications in structure and content, designed to streamline the compliance process, improve transparency and ensure precise reporting.

Due to these alterations, additional duration is required for developing systems, integrating components and evaluating the associated utilities.

Additionally, credits originating from Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) statements, which must be submitted by May 31, 2025, are anticipated to appear in early June, thus restricting the available timeframe for return submission without such an extension.

ITR filing FY 2024-25: It’s the month of July and every year this time, taxpayers are usually scrambling to get together documents to file their income tax return or ITR. However, those who file ITR-2 or ITR-3 have not yet been able to start the process of ITR filing since the utilities have not yet been released online (incometax.gov.in) or offline by the tax department.However, taxpayers have little reason to worry since this year the Income Tax Department has extended the deadline to file ITR from July 31 to September 15, 2025. Experts expect the ITR-2 and ITR-3 forms to be released soon.E xperts are of the view that the extensive changes in the Income Tax Return forms and the complexity of ITR-2 and ITR-3 has possibly caused the delay in release from the Income Tax Department’s end.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader People Advisory Services - Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR-2 / ITR-3 return forms are applicable for individuals with complex financial profiles such as income from multiple house properties, capital gains, foreign assets and foreign income, business or professional income (in the case of ITR-3), directorships, unlisted equity shares, total income exceeding INR 5 million, brought forward and carry forward of losses, etc.Also Read | Income Tax Return e-filing: Can you keep switching between new and old tax regime every year?

The delay in releasing the e-filing utility (online and offline) for ITR-2 / ITR-3 can be attributed to the substantive changes introduced in the return forms such as separate reporting of capital gains earned before and after 23 July 2024, detailed reporting of deductions / exemptions, reporting of TDS section codes, etc,” Sonu Iyer tells TOI.According to the EY tax expert, such changes require comprehensive technical modifications to align the utility with the enhanced reporting requirements and provisions of the Finance Act, 2024.The Income Tax Department has extended the deadline for filing returns to 15 September 2025 recognizing the time required to update the utilities and the time required for system readiness,” she adds.* Salary/pension earnings* Revenue from multiple residential properties* Any amount of capital gains* Overseas income or assets* Agricultural proceeds exceeding Rs.5,000* Those with RNOR/NRI status* Company directors or holders of unlisted equity* Cases involving combined spousal incomePersons earning from business or professional activitiesExcel-based utility now accommodates revised return submissions under Section 139(8A).Also Read | ITR e-filing AY 2025-25: What is Annual Information Statement (AIS) and how is it different from Form 26AS?

Scholar Before Stateswoman



Prime Minister Narendra Modi met his Indian roots Trinidad and Tobago counterpart Kamla Persad-Bissessar on Friday (Thursday in T&T) and called her “Bihar ki Beti” (daughter of Bihar), spotlighting her ancestral roots in Bihar’s Buxar district.While addressing a community event during PM Modi's visit, Bissessar praised PM Modi and recited his poem from his book 'Aankh Aa Dhanya Chhe'.Kamla Persad-Bissessar is the first woman to serve as Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean nation. Born on April 4, 1952, in Siparia, southern Trinidad, she has also held the positions of Attorney General and leader of the opposition, becoming the first woman in the country to hold each of these roles. According to her official profile on the World Economic Forum, she has been the political leader of the united national congress (UNC) since January 2010.Before entering national politics, Persad-Bissessar served as an alderman and later made her way to Parliament as the representative from Siparia in 1995. Over the years, she held several cabinet positions, including Attorney General, Minister of Legal Affairs, and Minister of Education.Kamla Persad-Bissessar has deep ancestral ties to India — more specifically, to Bhelupur village in Bihar’s Buxar district. In 2012, she visited her village during a private trip and called it one of the most emotional moments of her life. Welcomed with traditional Bihari folk songs, flower garlands, and heartfelt celebrations, she had told the villagers: “I feel I’ve come home.”Her contributions have not only earned her acclaim in Trinidad and Tobago but also recognition in India. In 2012, she was conferred the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman — the highest honour for overseas Indians — by then President Pratibha Patil, acknowledging her outstanding leadership and her efforts in strengthening India-Trinidad ties.Kamla Persad-Bissessar earned a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma in Education from the University of the West Indies, followed by a law degree from Hugh Wooding Law School, where she was ranked top of her class.She later completed an Executive MBA from the Arthur Lok Jack Graduate School of Business in Trinidad in 2006.Before stepping into politics, Persad-Bissessar spent over six years in academics — teaching at the University of the West Indies, St Andrew High School in Jamaica, and serving as a Consultant Lecturer at the Jamaica College of Insurance. She also worked as a social worker with the Church of England Children's Society in London, combining compassion with intellect long before entering Parliament.","Kamla Persad-Bissessar is the first woman to serve as Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean nation.

Market outlook: Asian stocks cautious as tariff uncertainty looms; oil prices dip on surprise OPEC+ output hike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/market-outlook-asian-stocks-cautious-as-tariff-uncertainty-looms-oil-prices-dip-on-surprise-opec-output-hike/articleshow/122287660.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Asian markets slipped into the red on Monday as fresh confusion over the US tariff policy weighed on investor sentiment, while oil prices extended losses after OPEC+ surprised markets with a bigger-than-expected output hike.Japanese shares shed 0.3%, South Korea’s KOSPI declined 0.7%, and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.1%. US stock futures were also under pressure, with S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures falling 0.3% each.As per Reuters, the weak mood came after US President Donald Trump said the US would notify countries of higher tariff rates by July 9, with new rates taking effect on August 1. Trump had earlier announced a base tariff of 10%, with the possibility of levies going up to 50%.However, little clarity was provided on which nations the new deadlines applied to, adding to investor anxiety.""President Trump’s going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don’t move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level,"" US treasury secretary Scott Bessent told CNN.The uncertainty comes as major US trading partners, including India, Japan, and the EU, are reportedly at critical stages of negotiation.“If reciprocal tariffs are implemented in their original form or even expanded, it will intensify downside risks to US growth and increase upside risks to inflation,” analysts at ANZ warned in a note, as per news agency Reuters.The tariff uncertainty has also kept currency markets subdued. The US dollar index remained near four-year lows at 96.913, while the yen stood at 144.38 per dollar. Safe-haven US Treasuries saw mild buying, with 10-year yields dipping to 4.326%.Oil markets were rattled further after OPEC+ announced on Saturday a surprise production increase of 548,000 barrels per day in August, higher than in previous months. Brent crude fell $0.80, or 1.2%, to $67.50 a barrel, and US WTI dropped $1.32 to $65.68 per barrel in early trade, as per Reuters.""The increased production clearly represents a more aggressive competition for market share and some tolerance for the resulting decline in price and revenue,"" said Tim Evans of Evans Energy, as quoted by Reuters.OPEC+ also signalled another potential hike in September, with analysts from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan warning this could lead to a crude surplus later in the year. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, raised its August price for Arab Light crude to a four-month high for Asian buyers, indicating confidence in demand.As per Bloomberg, despite current tightness in the oil market, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo cautioned that ""rising risks like ongoing trade tensions"" could weaken the outlook over the next 6–12 months.Adding to geopolitical uncertainty, China imposed procurement restrictions on EU-based medical device firms, complicating its attempts to ease trade tensions with the US.","Japanese shares shed 0.3%, South Korea's KOSPI declined 0.7%, and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.1%.

In the meantime, both sides are working toward an interim trade deal. India has set firm boundaries on sensitive areas such as agriculture and dairy as negotiations over the interim trade pact with the US move forward.Earlier this year, Trump had threatened Brics nations, including India, of imposing 100% tariffs on trade in case the bloc moved forward with plans to replace the US dollar.

The United States will reinstate tariffs on imports from key trading partners—including Taiwan and the European Union—starting August 1 if bilateral trade deals are not reached, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday.Bessent, speaking to CNN, said the suspended levies—originally announced by President Donald Trump on April 2—would “boomerang back” to their previously high levels unless agreements are finalised by July 9. The administration had earlier paused the hike to allow negotiations with affected countries, Bessent said, AFP reported.The Treasury Secretary’s remarks reaffirm Trump’s comments made aboard Air Force One on Friday. “Well, I’ll probably start them on August 1. Well, that’s pretty early. Right?” Trump had said, adding that he had signed 12 letters to notify countries of the upcoming tariff regime, likely to be sent Monday.The April tariff plan involved a 10% duty on most imports, with steeper hikes for select nations. The rates were paused until July 9 to allow for trade talks, which are now nearing their conclusion. Countries have been rushing to secure deals to avoid the elevated tariffs.So far, the Trump administration has finalised agreements with the United Kingdom and Vietnam. Meanwhile, the US and China have mutually agreed to temporarily reduce steep duties on each other’s goods, AFP stated.Bessent said Washington was “close to several deals” and that “several big announcements” were likely in the next few days. However, he declined to name specific countries. “I don’t want to let them off the hook,” he said.As the July 9 deadline approaches, Trump has doubled down on his plan to issue formal notifications instead of extended negotiations. “This is what you have to pay if you want to do business with the United States,” he reportedly said on Friday.Bessent also dismissed claims that the administration was leveraging threats instead of diplomacy, telling CNN’s Dana Bash that August 1 was not a new deadline. “It’s not a new deadline. We are saying, this is when it’s happening. If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that’s your choice,” he said.He added that the Trump strategy was to apply “maximum pressure,” pointing to the European Union, which he said was “making very good progress” after initially lagging behind in negotiations.EU and US trade negotiators are continuing talks through the weekend. France’s finance minister said on Saturday that he hoped a deal could be reached before Monday.However, not all countries appear ready to yield. Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Sunday that Tokyo “won’t easily compromise” in its trade negotiations with the US.Leaders of BRICS nations, who are meeting in Rio de Janeiro, are also expected to voice strong opposition to the US tariff strategy, warning that the measures are “illegal” and could hurt the global economy.","US will reinstate tariffs on imports from key trading partners starting August 1 if bilateral trade deals are not reached, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday.

Khamenei's Biggest SHOCK To Trump; Iran Beats US Sanctions, Oil Output Highest Since 1978!

The OPEC+ alliance of oil-producing nations, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, decided on Saturday to increase crude output by 548,000 barrels per day in August, accelerating the unwinding of voluntary production cuts amid signs of a stabilising global economy and firm market fundamentals.At a virtual meeting, eight members of the 22-nation group, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, agreed to raise supply levels, citing low oil inventories and a steady global economic outlook as key factors for the decision, as per news agency AP.The production hike marks a faster pace than previous months, when the group approved increases of 411,000 bpd for May, June, and July, and just 138,000 bpd in April. With the August addition, the bloc will have restored nearly 1.92 million bpd of the 2.2 million barrels they initially cut in April under a phased 18-month schedule set to run through late 2026.According to news agency Reuters, the move comes amid mounting pressure from global consumers and the United States, which has urged producers to increase supply to ease fuel prices. The alliance, which controls about half of the world’s oil output, began cutting production in 2022 to stabilise the market, but has shifted course in 2025 to reclaim market share and respond to rising demand.The price of Brent crude futures settled at $68.30 per barrel for September delivery, while US West Texas Intermediate crude closed at $66.50 for August contracts. Oil prices had briefly spiked following the recent 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran but have since dropped back, partly due to a US-brokered peace deal that followed American strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.The OPEC Secretariat, in a statement, reiterated that the August increase was in line with an earlier agreement made in December 2023 to gradually restore the 2.2 million bpd cut. That delay had originally been attributed to weak global demand and rising competition from non-OPEC producers.According to CNBC, the eight producers involved in Saturday’s meeting are implementing two sets of voluntary cuts alongside the coalition's broader policy. One, totalling 1.66 million bpd, remains in effect until end-2026, while the second, which initially curbed an additional 2.2 million bpd until March, is now being rolled back in monthly increments.As per Reuters, tensions within the group have risen recently, as some members such as Kazakhstan and Iraq, exceeded their targets in recent months, prompting internal disagreements.Kazakh output, in particular, rebounded strongly in June, reaching historic highs.The UAE, which received approval for an additional 300,000 bpd increase outside the main quota, has also been pushing for a larger share of future production, signalling internal recalibrations as the alliance adjusts to a changing market.The next meeting of the eight-member sub-group is scheduled for August 3, where further steps in the production schedule may be finalised.","The OPEC+ alliance of oil-producing nations, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, decided on Saturday to increase crude output by 548,000 barrels per day in August.

Saudi Arabia, Russia, and six other key members of the OPEC+ group have announced rising oil production by 548,000 barrels per day (bpd) in August, more than what analysts had predicted.Experts were expecting the group to stick to an increase of 411,000 bpd, which had been the monthly target for May, June and July. But the alliance said in a statement that the decision for a bigger hike was due to “a steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories.”Jorge Leon from Rystad Energy told AFP, ""OPEC+ keeps surprising the market — this latest hike was even larger than expected and sends a clear message, for anyone still in doubt: the group is firmly shifting toward a market share strategy.""Leon further said that two big questions remain: first, after the full 2.2 million barrels per day of voluntary cuts are rolled back, will OPEC+ move to unwind the next tier of 1.66 million barrels. Aditionally, will there be enough demand in the market to absorb that additional supply?""With prices holding comfortably above $60 and a turbulent geopolitical backdrop — especially given the fragile ceasefire in the Middle East, and broader risks in Ukraine and Libya — the answer to both questions might well be 'yes'.""Another analyst, Giovanni Staunovo, from UBS added, ""Effectively Kazakhstan and Iraq still overproducing their higher quotas is a factor supporting the cut unwind decision.""The decision follows a tense 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel, which briefly pushed oil prices above $80 per barrel due to fears over a possible closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial route for about 20% of global oil.OPEC+, made up of the 12 members of OPEC and its allies, had been cutting production since 2022 to support prices. But in a surprising shift, eight countries led by Saudi Arabia began raising output in May, causing oil prices to fall. Prices have since hovered between $65 and $70 per barrel.An estimate by Bloomberg suggested that despite doubling production targets, the group only increased output by 200,000 bpd in May. This fresh hike could be Saudi Arabia’s way of putting pressure on members who have not stuck to their agreed quotas, by reducing the profits they can make from oil.","Saudi Arabia, Russia, and six other key members of the OPEC+ group have announced rising oil production by 548,000 barrels per day (bpd) in August.

Vietnam’s economy grew 7.52 per cent in the first half of 2025, its highest pace in over a decade, on the back of strong exports and despite global uncertainties, the General Statistics Office (GSO) announced on Saturday.This comes just days after Hanoi secured relief from the steepest tariffs threatened by US President Donald Trump.According to GSO, the GDP expansion between January and June marked the fastest first-half growth since 2011, with the second quarter alone growing 7.96 per cent year-on-year.""Our country's socio-economic performance... achieved very positive results, approaching the set target in the context of many uncertainties in the world and regional economy,"" the GSO said in its statement, as per news agency AFP.Vietnam, a key global manufacturing hub, had reported 7.1 per cent growth in 2024 and is targeting an ambitious 8 per cent in 2025. The new figures put the country well on track, driven largely by soaring exports, which reached $219.83 billion in the first half, a 14.4 per cent year-on-year rise.Processed industrial goods made up nearly 90 per cent of this total.This export momentum gained further significance after Hanoi reached a trade deal with Washington that capped most tariffs at 20 per cent, avoiding the earlier threatened rate of 46 per cent.The deal also opened Vietnam’s market to US goods at zero tariffs. However, a 40 per cent tariff remains in place for ""transshipped"" goods, those moving through Vietnam to evade origin-country tariffs, a move aimed largely at Chinese products, as per the New York Times.Vietnam is the US’s largest export partner in Southeast Asia, with shipments to America valued at $70.91 billion in the first half alone, according to GSO data.The US is also Vietnam’s biggest trade partner after China and Mexico.While the new tariffs are significantly lower than what Trump had originally proposed, they are still five times higher than previous levels, as per Bloomberg.Uncertainty remains over how these tariffs will impact supply chains, especially given Vietnam’s heavy reliance on Chinese inputs for manufacturing.""With the new 20 per cent tariff, we think the government will speed up industrial upgrading and shift exports from low-margin goods to higher value-added products such as semiconductors,"" Fitch Solutions said in a note, highlighting upside risks to its 2025 GDP forecast of 6.4 per cent, according to news agency Reuters.Investment firm Dragon Capital’s founder Dominic Scriven also described the trade deal as “net-positive,” stating that fears of a more damaging blow had been avoided. “With external trade risk now moderating, attention can return to the country’s core growth engine, the domestic and private sector economy,” he said.Vietnam’s industrial production grew 10.3 per cent during the April-June quarter, and consumer inflation in June stood at 3.57 per cent, according to official data.The country's efforts to reorganise its administrative setup by merging several provinces and cities last month were also cited by GSO as part of broader socio-economic development plans.Still, concerns persist over the longer-term implications of the new US trade terms.As per the New York Times, ambiguities remain over which Vietnamese products will be considered transshipped or excessively reliant on Chinese inputs, potentially subjecting them to the harsher 40 per cent levy.Trump, in his announcement, characterised the new pact as a “Great Deal of Cooperation,” though critics argued the tariffs, ultimately paid by US importers, would still impose a burden on American businesses and consumers.","Vietnam’s economy grew 7.52 per cent in the first half of 2025, its highest pace in over a decade.

Spot the fake ones out: Labubu or Lafufu? Fans struggle to identify originals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/spot-the-fake-ones-out-labubu-or-lafufu-fans-struggle-to-identify-originals/articleshow/122265943.cms,"Labubu fans around the world are struggling to keep up with a growing wave of fakes, known as ""Lafufus,"" dolls that look just like the real thing. These knock-offs are fooling even the most alert collectors, despite Pop Mart's efforts to stop the spread.Pop Mart, the Beijing-based brand behind the popular Labubu dolls, uses QR codes and barcode checks to confirm if a toy is genuine. But as one Chennai-based content creator found out, even these steps aren't always enough.“I had picked up a Labubu for myself and had done an unboxing video which got a lot of views,” said the creator, who did not want to be named. “I thought it would be fun to do a video with my whole family unboxing their Labubus, so I picked up a pack of six. We did an unboxing video and even authenticated the product,"" ET quoted the influencer.She followed Pop Mart’s instructions by scanning the QR code and entering the barcode digits. Her toys passed the test. But later, an eagle-eyed collector noticed something was off, the website itself was fake, and her toys were actually Lafufus.Even though she later replaced the fake with a real Labubu, she took it in her stride.“Lafufus have their own fan base too!” she said.Labubu dolls, small figures with pointy ears, big eyes, and nine-toothed grins, first appeared in 2019 and quickly became a craze. Sold in “blind boxes,” these toys cost between $20 and $30 but can fetch much higher prices. One life-sized version recently sold at a Beijing auction for a record $150,000 (about Rs 1.28 crore).As demand soars, so does the counterfeit trade. Last month, Chinese customs seized over 46,000 fake Labubu toys. State media warned of a growing black market hurting both consumers and creators.Pop Mart’s sales have skyrocketed thanks to Labubu’s popularity. Since going public in Hong Kong in 2020, the company’s founder Wang Ning has become one of China’s top ten billionaires, with a net worth of $22 billion.But Lafufus are gaining ground. They cost as little as $7.50 and are seen by many as a cheaper way to join the trend.“The fakes have become so good,” said Abbas Zaveri, founder of HypeFly, a marketplace for sneakers and collectibles told ET.“Things that customers could look out for is that the heads of the lafufus tend to be very flimsy and the font on the box generally is embossed but the quality on the boxes of fakes tend to be sub-par.”Zaveri further added that despite the original pack for 6 costs more than Rs 24,000, some Indian websites are selling it for just Rs 9,000.Nikhil Jain, who runs City Kicks India, believes the problem is widespread. “About 70–80% of the dolls in the Indian market are Lafufus,” he said. “The site URL had subtle misspellings like ""Pop Mari"" or ""Poap Mart"" which are good tell-tale signs for this fraud. There are some marketplaces that have had to set up a team to authenticate their products because earlier they sold them as originals and customers figured out that they were being charged for an original but received a lafufu instead. ”The issue isn’t limited to India. In Scotland, consumer group Advice Direct Scotland warned that fake Labubus are tricking families and upsetting children.“These counterfeits are not only deceiving collectors and draining hard-earned money from families, but they are also leaving children heartbroken,” said Hazel Knowles, consumer project lead at the organisation. “We urge consumers to be vigilant, buy only from trusted retailers and report suspected fakes.”","Pop Mart, the Beijing-based brand behind the popular Labubu dolls, uses QR codes and barcode checks to confirm if a toy is genuine.

Donald Trump's Tariff Plan: ‘Take it or leave it’

Challenges in Finalising Trade Deals

Donald Trump’s tariff deadline: Ahead of his self-imposed deadline on reciprocal tariffs, US President Donald Trump has said that 12 countries will be getting letters Monday onwards detailing their tariff rates.It is yet unclear which twelve countries have been finalized by the US for new reciprocal tariff rates, which will reportedly be effective from August 1, 2025. Trump’s announcement comes at a time when India and the US are in discussions to finalise a trade deal. Indian officials, on a visit to Washington for trade deal talks, have returned. India has also indicated that it does not believe in agreeing to trade deals based on deadlines.During his journey to New Jersey on Air Force One, Trump spoke to journalists but withheld the names of the recipient countries, stating this information would be revealed on Monday.Also Read | India-US trade deal: 'Don't make deals based on deadlines, national interest paramount', says Piyush Goyal as Donald Trump's tariff date nears Initially, Trump had indicated to reporters that the first set of letters would be distributed on Friday, which was a national holiday in the United States, but this timeline was subsequently altered.""I signed some letters and they'll go out on Monday, probably twelve,"" Trump said according to a Reuters report when questioned about his tariff strategy.""Different amounts of money, different amounts of tariffs.""According to the report, Trump’s letters will be sent with the American side indicating a ‘take it or leave it’ offers.Amidst a global trade conflict that has disrupted financial markets and prompted policymakers to protect their economies, Trump introduced in April a baseline 10% tariff rate plus supplementary charges for most nations, with some reaching up to 50%.Subsequently, all rates above the 10% baseline were temporarily suspended for 90 days to facilitate negotiation opportunities.Also Read | 'Reserve the right to suspend...': Amidst trade deal talks, India proposes retaliatory duties against US at WTO; here’s what the issue is about This suspension period concludes on July 9, though Trump indicated early on Friday that tariffs could now potentially reach 70%, with most taking effect from August 1.The US president and his senior officials had initially planned to engage in tariff rate discussions with many nations. However, after facing multiple challenges with major trading allies, including Japan and the European Union, Trump has become less enthusiastic about this approach.On Friday evening, he briefly commented to journalists: ""The letters are better ... much easier to send a letter.""He remained silent regarding his earlier forecast about finalising broader trade deals before July 9.Also Read | What is Donald Trump’s net worth?

The first, with Britain in May, maintained a 10% rate and provided special considerations for specific industries, notably automobiles and aircraft engines.The second agreement, with Vietnam, reduced tariffs on numerous Vietnamese products from 46% to 20%, whilst allowing many American goods to enter Vietnam without duties.The anticipated agreement with India has not come to fruition yet, and European Union diplomats reported on Friday that discussions with the Trump administration have reached an impasse.

"Oil market watch: Saudi, Russia-led OPEC+ eyes fresh hike for August; focus to likely shift from price stability to market share",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/oil-market-watch-saudi-russia-led-opec-eyes-fresh-hike-for-august-focus-to-likely-shift-from-price-stability-to-market-share/articleshow/122260781.cms,"AI image

Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other major oil producers from the OPEC+ alliance will meet on Saturday to decide their crude output strategy for August, with analysts expecting the bloc to approve another production hike of 411,000 barrels per day (bpd), mirroring decisions made for May, June and July.The meeting will be held virtually and will include representatives from Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Oman, according to news agency AFP.The so-called “Voluntary Eight” (V8) group within OPEC+ had earlier stunned markets by reversing course from prolonged supply cuts and opting to raise production sharply from May onwards.This shift has pulled down oil prices to a narrow band of $65–$70 per barrel, far below the highs seen earlier during Middle East tensions.Analysts cited by AFP say that the alliance appears increasingly focused on reclaiming market share over price stability. “The group has placed an increased focus on regaining market shares over price stability,” said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen, highlighting the competitive pressure from rising supply elsewhere, including the United States.Despite the scheduled hike, actual supply additions could fall short.As per AFP, Rystad Energy’s Jorge Leon said that the real increase might be only 250,000–300,000 bpd, much like May’s 200,000 bpd gain, despite doubled quotas. This shortfall is partly due to non-compliance by countries like Kazakhstan and Iraq, whose production exceeded agreed limits.UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo added that such inconsistencies may be pushing leading producers like Saudi Arabia to tighten enforcement via output-driven price pressure.While market watchers are bracing for the expected rise, there is little anticipation of price shocks, especially as geopolitical concerns have eased. A recent 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel, which had temporarily pushed prices over $80, didn’t cause supply disruptions.“Given there were no supply disruptions so far, the war is unlikely to impact the decision,” Staunovo said, as cited by AFP. Hansen echoed that the conflict could even justify faster production increases if Iran’s exports face future hurdles.According to news agency Reuters, earlier, some OPEC+ insiders believed that the group could consider a hike larger than 411,000 bpd. But consensus still leans toward a continuation of the current pace, especially as Brent futures hovered around $68.30 per barrel and WTI near $66.50 in holiday-thinned trade ahead of the meeting.Analysts such as Tamas Varga of PVM warned that additional output, if sustained, may swell global oil inventories in the second half of the year. “Oil balance estimates will be reassessed and will suggest accelerated swelling in global oil reserves,” Varga said, as quoted by Reuters.The eight OPEC+ countries have already committed to raising production by 1.37 million bpd over four months, roughly 62% of the 2.2 million bpd they initially pledged to cut. With US nuclear talks with Iran possibly resuming and global economic policies shifting, the alliance’s strategy is under growing scrutiny.Still, Saturday’s meeting is not expected to trigger any major market volatility, as traders are largely in a “wait-and-see mode”, said Price Futures Group’s Phil Flynn, who cited upcoming US fiscal changes and lingering tariff uncertainty as additional variables, according to Reuters.","OPEC+ to meet on Saturday to decide output strategy for August.

Why it matters

The big picture

What happens next, he warns, could be one of three scenarios:

A politically unpopular slashing of spending.

A massive increase in taxes.

Or a monetary intervention involving printing more money and lowering interest rates - which would “devalue the dollar and hurt bondholders.”

Between the lines

Zoom in

What they are saying

Dalio sees systemic risk not just for America, but for the global economy: “The US Treasury market is the backbone of all capital markets, which are the backbones of our economic and social conditions.” If confidence in US debt erodes, the entire financial architecture could wobble.

Ken Rogoff, former chief economist of the IMF, agrees: “It’s not clear markets will tolerate” further borrowing sprees when a real crisis hits. He warned that the US is leaving itself without fiscal headroom to respond to future emergencies.

Even the dollar - long considered a safe haven - is starting to reflect these jitters. It just posted its worst first-half performance since 1973, a signal that foreign investors may be losing confidence in the US fiscal trajectory.

The Trump administration’s view

The math doesn’t add up - at least not for Dalio

Catch up quick

Congress passed the bill 218–214 after weeks of internal GOP wrangling.

The Senate version was made law with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.

The CBO estimates 11.8 million Americans will lose health coverage and 3 million will lose food stamp eligibility by 2034.

Some Republicans expressed discomfort with the deficits - then voted yes anyway.

What’s next

President Donald Trump’s newly passed $3.4 trillion tax and spending package - dubbed by supporters as “One Big Beautiful Bill” - is being denounced by Wall Street figures, economists, and bond market analysts as a fiscal time bomb. Among the most vocal: Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, who says the bill will lead to “big, painful disruptions” for American families and the global financial system if not urgently reversed.The legislation, passed with razor-thin margins in Congress, is expected to add $3.4 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It comes at a time of relative economic stability - not a war, recession, or pandemic. Critics argue that deficit spending without crisis justification marks a dangerous shift in American fiscal policy.Dalio breaks it down in stark terms: annual federal spending will balloon to around $7 trillion, while revenues will hover near $5 trillion. “The debt... is now about 6x of the money taken in, 100 percent of GDP, and about $230,000 per American family,” Dalio wrote. In ten years, those numbers could rise to “7.5x the money taken in, 130 percent of GDP, and $425,000 per family.”This isn’t just theoretical. Rising federal debt will demand more borrowing, and that means higher interest and principal payments. Dalio estimates that those costs will soar from $10 trillion today to $18 trillion - with annual interest alone doubling to $2 trillion.The bond market - where the US borrows money - has already begun sending distress signals. Yields on long-term Treasurys jumped in May, nearing their highest levels in two decades, reflecting unease over the government’s fiscal trajectory.Bill Gross, founder of Pimco and one of the bond market’s most respected voices, likened the US to “a teenager with a credit card that has no limits.” He warned that the payment is coming - not via default, but through “a weak dollar and higher interest rates.”The Wall Street Journal, in an in-depth analysis, highlighted the extraordinary nature of the moment: a historic deficit without a national emergency. Typically, large-scale federal borrowing is reserved for times of crisis - like the 2008 financial collapse or the Covid pandemic.This time is different. “The market has been willing to tolerate spikes in borrowing during crises... What stands out now... is that America is bingeing on debt when there’s no such emergency requiring it,” the WSJ noted.Moody’s projects that the deficit, already at $1.8 trillion (6% of GDP), will climb to nearly 9% by 2035. That would push the national debt from just under 100% of GDP today to more than 130% - surpassing even World War II-era highs.President Trump and Republican lawmakers say the bill’s $4.5 trillion in tax cuts will supercharge economic growth. They argue that cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and green energy subsidies are essential to ""rightsizing"" government.“For all cost-cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected,” Trump posted online. “We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before.”They also tout provisions such as new deductions for tips and overtime, a hike in the child tax credit, and business incentives to spur investment. Trump calls the bill “a phenomenal victory” and plans to sign it on July 4th.Dalio doesn’t buy the growth-will-save-us logic. He warns that the exploding interest burden will force the Fed to either crush the economy with higher rates or suppress rates artificially - triggering inflation and dollar devaluation.The scenario he paints is bleak: “Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3%... big, painful disruptions will likely occur.”That includes a potential bond market revolt, skyrocketing borrowing costs for households and businesses, and a shrinking safety net just as economic headwinds build.Markets are watching closely. The Fed, already navigating post-pandemic economic turbulence, may have to intervene if long-term rates spike. That could limit its ability to fight inflation or support growth.Foreign investors, who hold nearly one-third of US public debt, may start reallocating to other safer assets. As Harvard economist Jeremy Stein puts it, “I wouldn’t be surprised... if they start shifting that reinvestment more towards, say, Europe or German bonds.”The cost of Trump’s “big, beautiful” bill may not be fully visible today - but Dalio and Wall Street are betting we’ll all feel it tomorrow.(With inputs from agencies)","Congress passed $3.4 trillion tax and spending package - dubbed by supporters as ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ Critics argue that deficit spending without crisis justification marks a dangerous shift in American fiscal policy.

"Trump’s 'big, beautiful bill': Why it's making China laugh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-why-its-making-china-laugh-and-stronger/articleshow/122252330.cms,"FULL: Trump's Stunning Victory Speech After 'Big, Beautiful' Win In U.S. Cong | Watch

“There has never been a more intimate connection between a nation’s ability to generate huge amounts of electricity at affordable prices... and its economic and military might,” the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote this week. ""The Chinese can’t believe their luck.""

Why it matters

The big picture

Trump’s bill quickly phases out tax credits for utility-scale wind and solar projects and cuts incentives for electric vehicle buyers years ahead of schedule.

The bill adds intricate restrictions on battery tax credits that exclude companies tied to “prohibited foreign entities” like China-ironically making the credits near-impossible to claim.

The bill also kills the methane fee from the Inflation Reduction Act and delays permitting for key grid upgrades, all while locking in $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, $1.2 trillion in safety net reductions, and $350 billion in hardline immigration and military spending.

Friedman summed it up sharply: “In one fell swoop, this bill will make your home hotter, your air conditioning bill higher, your clean energy job scarcer, America’s auto industry weaker and China happier.”

Zoom in: Texas shows the stakes

What they’re saying:

Elon Musk: “Utterly insane and destructive.”

Nick Nigro, WSJ: “The big-picture outlook for energy is we are going to be less competitive because of this law.”

Ray Dalio : “This will lead to unimaginable tax increases or a lot of printing and devaluing of money.”

: “This will lead to unimaginable tax increases or a lot of printing and devaluing of money.” Thomas Friedman: “China may have to make July 4 its own national holiday going forward: American Electricity Dependence Day.”

Between the lines

Debt dangers

Beyond energy, the bill also obliterates fiscal sanity. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, warns that the legislation pushes America deeper into a debt spiral that could crash credit markets and destabilize the global economy.

The bill’s $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and defense spending will add another $3.4 trillion to the deficit by 2034, per the Congressional Budget Office. Government debt is now projected to hit 130% of GDP within a decade. That’s worse than the US level after World War II.

Dalio didn’t mince words: “Unless this path is soon rectified… big, painful disruptions will likely occur.” His concern? That interest payments will balloon to $2 trillion annually, forcing a mix of inflation, tax hikes, and spending cuts that gut the economy.

The bill also adds $3.3 trillion to the deficit, with Ray Dalio warning it will erode investor confidence and increase financial instability. “This path is unsustainable,” Dalio said.

What’s next

Trump calls it “beautiful.” But to Beijing, it’s miraculous. Friedman put it bluntly: “There are only two political parties in the world today cheering the passage of this bill: Trump’s Republican Party and the Chinese Communist Party.”

On July 4, while Americans celebrated their independence, China may be celebrating something else: the greatest gift Washington has handed it in decades.President Donald Trump’s newly passed “One Big Beautiful Bill”-a sprawling 869-page tax and spending law-does more than enshrine his second-term agenda. It delivers a devastating blow to America’s renewable energy industry at the exact moment artificial intelligence is fueling a global electricity arms race. And it gives President Xi Jinping and China a clear runway to dominate that future.Experts say this may be one of the most self-destructive energy policies in modern history. “It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said. China, meanwhile, is doubling down on solar, wind, and battery power, preparing to lead the next economic era.Friedman warned in the New York Times: “This dog’s breakfast of a bill… is sure to put at risk billions of dollars of investments in renewable energy… and potentially kill the jobs of tens of thousands of US workers.”Texas has quietly become America’s top clean power state.A Texas A&M report showed the state added 2,596 MW of solar, wind, and battery storage in just one quarter, overtaking California for the top spot.Texas grid expert Doug Lewin posted last week that the state added 10,000 megawatts of new power last year, mostly solar-plus-battery. “Brownouts are down,” he said, “and reliability is up.”But under Trump’s bill, future projects will be more expensive, slower to build, and potentially ineligible for tax credits. That means higher costs for utilities-and for families. “Now the electricity will cost consumers a lot more,” Lewin warned.The bill’s energy policies not only conflict with America’s innovation trajectory-they also defy global trends. Saudi Arabia is building solar farms to power AI data centers. Even fossil-fuel giants are investing in green energy for strategic advantage.China is using a different playbook. In 2000, it produced 1,300 terawatt-hours of electricity. Now it generates over 10,000, while the US has only added 500 terawatt-hours in the same time. China’s growth is increasingly coming from wind, solar, hydro, and battery projects-not coal.A Financial Times report from Shanghai described China’s strategic evolution into an “electrostate”-a nation powered by clean electricity and buffered against trade wars and geopolitical shocks, Friedman said in his NYT column.Tariff trouble: Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs could drive up the cost and delay deployment of gas turbines and renewables even further.AI grid crunch: With AI data centers consuming vast amounts of electricity, grid expansion is urgent. But Trump’s bill delays and obstructs transmission upgrades-slowing economic growth.Job losses: Research firm Energy Innovation projects the bill will increase wholesale electricity prices by 50% by 2035, raise household energy costs by $16 billion annually by 2030, and eliminate or prevent 830,000 renewable jobs.(With inputs from agencies)","President Donald Trump’s newly passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” does more than enshrine his second-term agenda.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Explainer: What is 'Hindu rate of growth' and why Raghuram Rajan's remarks may be 'premature',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/explainer-what-is-hindu-rate-of-growth-and-why-raghuram-rajans-remarks-may-be-premature/articleshow/98482598.cms,"What is meant by Hindu growth rate

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%. Raghuram Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-98483158,imgsize-65724,width-400,resizemode-4/98483158.jpg"

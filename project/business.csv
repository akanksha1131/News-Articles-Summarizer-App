Gold rates have been hitting life-time highs and analysts are of the view that hopes of Federal Reserve rate cuts are driving the rally. Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan shares his views on gold price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance:

Spot Gold, driven by rate cut hopes and risks to the Fed’s independence, extended its winning streak to the fifth straight day on September 1. Earlier, the yellow metal closed with a weekly gain of 2.25% at $3,448 in the week ending August 29. At the time of writing this article, the shiny metal was changing hands at $3,475, up 0.80% for the day. The MCX October gold contract at Rs 104,724 was up 0.87%.

Data roundup:

US data released on August 29 showed that US real personal spending rose by 0.3% in July, the most in four months. Core PCE Price Index came in at 2.9% y-o-y and matched the estimate, though it accelerated from the June reading of 2.8%, whereas headline PCE Price Index was up 2.6% y-o-y that matched the prior data and the estimate. The advance goods trade deficit surged to a record high of 103.60 billion in July. University of Michigan Sentiment (August) was revised lower from 58.60 to 58.20, three-month low, in its final reading as one-year and 5-10- year inflation expectations at 4.8% and 3.5% respectively fell short of their respective estimates. Although Fed’s preferred inflation gauge showed that inflation remains well above the Fed’s target of 2%, markets have taken the data in their stride and look for a 25-bps rate cut in the September FOMC meeting to be held on September 16-17.

China’s PMIs were mixed, while Eurozone manufacturing PMI was revised higher from 50.50 to 50.70 in its final reading.

Fed Watch:

The Fed Governor Waller said on August 29 that he supports a 25-bps rate cut in September and expects more cuts this year. He added that a jumbo rate cut possible should the economy weaken considerably.

Trade and tariff:

Court ruling on Trump’s tariffs:

On August 30, a federal appeals court, in its 7-4 decision, ruled that most of the President Trump's tariffs exceeded his emergency powers as president as the US Court of Appeals court called reciprocal tariffs imposed universally on almost every country illegal. However, the court said that tariffs would remain in place until mid-October, as the case would be taken up by the US Supreme Court. As most of the Supreme Court judges who will investigate the case have been appointed by Republicans, markets are not ruling out the Court’s decision to come out in the President’s favor.

Gold ETF:

As of August 29, total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 93.282 MOz, a fresh 2-year high and a fresh cycle high, as holdings jumped by around 1% in the week ending August 29. Gold ETF holdings are up around 10.50 MOz (around 330 tons) or 12.59% YTD. COMEX gold inventory at 38.926 MOz are down 13.65% from the record high level of 45.07 MOz.

Prominent economist Mohammed El-Erian highlighted structural demand for gold in a post on social media platform X as he shared a post of the fund manager Tavi Costa which showed a chart indicating that for the first time since 1996, global central banks' direct holdings of gold now exceed their treasury holdings as a percentage of foreign reserves for the first time since 1996. The development is slightly supportive for the metal.

CFTC:

As per weekly CFTC data, money managers increased their bullish gold bets by 6,364 net-long positions to 148,122 in the week ending August 26. Long-only positions rose 3,813 lots to 181,374 lots. The short-only bets fell to the lowest level in three weeks.

China unites world leaders:

On September 1, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, using the platform of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in Tianjin, China, urged the leaders of nearly two dozen countries including Russia, Iran and India to integrate their economies and build an orderly multipolar world. He also proposed establishing SCO development bank to deepen economic ties.

US Dollar Index and yields:

At the time of writing this article, the US Dollar Index was hovering around 97.68, down 0.10% for the day. US bond market was closed due to Labor Day Holiday. Both 2-year and 10-year yields were lower in the week ending August 29 as the yield curve underwent a bull steepening with 2-year yields falling more than the 10-year yields.

Upcoming data:

This week is a crucial week for data as major US data on cards this week include ISM manufacturing (September 2), JOLTs job openings (September 3), ADP employment change (September 4), ISM services (September 4) and nonfarm payroll report (September 5).

Investors will also focus on Eurozone CPI (September 2), Eurozone services PMI (September 3) and Eurozone GDP (September 5).

Gold Price Outlook:

Gold is gaining mainly on rate cut hopes and risks to the Fed’s independence as the Trump Administration tries to dominate the Fed. Rate cut hopes have soared further on Governor Waller’s comments. In this context, the upcoming US nonfarm payroll will be crucial. Buying the dips is the preferred strategy. A test of all-time high at $3500 (Rs 105,500) looks highly likely. A disappointing ISM services/ nonfarm payroll data would be quite positive for the metal. Next major resistance comes in at $3,650 (Rs 110,000) Support is at $3450 (Rs 103,900)/$3400 (Rs 102,400).

Silver is expected to test $43 resistance (MCX December contract Rs 131,500) in the coming months as ETF inflows remain quite healthy. Support is at $40 (Rs 122,500)/ $39.50 (Rs 121,000).

Who is Laurent Freixe?

Born in 1962, French national Laurent Freixe devoted nearly four decades to Nestlé.

He joined the group in France in 1986, beginning in sales and marketing before moving into leadership roles across Europe.

He became market head of Nestlé Hungary in 2003, later taking charge of Spain and Portugal in 2007.

By 2008, he was appointed executive vice president and zone director for Europe, steering the region through the financial turbulence of the subprime and euro crises.

In 2014, Freixe took over as executive vice president and CEO of Zone Americas, covering the US, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean.

Eight years later in 2022, he became CEO of Zone Latin America before being promoted to chief executive officer of Nestlé SA in 2024.

in 2024. Fluent in French, English, Spanish and German, Freixe combined global business experience with governance responsibilities. He served on the boards of Cereal Partners Worldwide and the Consumer Goods Forum, chaired the Global Alliance for YOUth, and was a member of the European Roundtable (ERT).

He also held advisory positions with EDHEC Business School and the IMD Foundation Board.

Educated at EDHEC Business School in Lille with executive training at IMD, Switzerland, Freixe was known for his long service and operational expertise across continents.

His abrupt dismissal, however, ends a 40-year association with Nestlé on a controversial note.





Swiss food giant Nestlé has dismissed its chief executive Laurent Freixe with immediate effect after an internal investigation found he had an “undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate,” in violation of the company’s code of business conduct.The move was confirmed by the group on Monday, with chairman Paul Bulcke stating, “This was a necessary decision. Nestlé’s values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service,” as quoted by news agency AFP.The board said the investigation was overseen by Bulcke and lead independent director Pablo Isla, with support from external counsel. Freixe’s departure comes less than a year after he was appointed CEO in September 2024, tasked with reviving the company’s performance amid sluggish consumer spending and a sharp fall in its share price.Nestlé, which owns brands such as KitKat, Nespresso, Purina and Maggi, named Nespresso CEO Philipp Navratil as his successor.",Laurent Freixe has been dismissed as CEO of Swiss food giant Nestlé.

Next-gen GST reforms will make eco transparent: FM Nirmala Sitharaman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/next-gen-gst-reforms-will-make-eco-transparent-fm-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/123666959.cms,"



CHENNAI/NEW DELHI: Ahead of a crucial meeting of the GST Council starting Wednesday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said the proposed rollout of next generation reforms in eight-year-old indirect tax will make an economy absolutely open and transparent and further lower the compliance burden, helping small businesses thrive.At an event organised by City Union Bank, she pointed to the reforms taskforce set up by PM Narendra Modi to ease compliances and said: ""Complementing this, the planned rollout of the next generation GST reforms with a council meeting tomorrow (Wednesday) and the day after, and in the coming months, it will set an economy absolutely open and transparent.""Apart from shrinking the number of main slabs to three - 5%, 18% and 40% - by moving goods and services out of the 12% and 28% brackets - the Centre has circulated a plan for simplifying the registration and filing system to ease the burden on businesses. In any case, fewer slabs will end the classification concerns of businesses.The Centre has proposed that all food items and textiles products should face a 5% levy, instead of them being scattered across multiple rates. Similarly, white goods are proposed to be included in the 18% segment, with mass use products such as refrigerators, large TC sets and air-conditioners seeing the GST drop from the current 18%. Sin goods and a handful of luxury items, such as large cars, will face 40% tax, with the cess likely to be done away with.There is intense lobbying from industries, particularly automobiles and textiles, on the issue of rates.A critical element of the entire strategy is to get all the states on board, a challenge for Sitharaman as the head of the all-powerful body comprising ministers from the states and three UTs (Delhi, J&K and Puducherry). Opposition ruled states have upped the ante ahead of the meeting, arguing that they should be compensated for revenue loss. On its part, the Centre has argued that it too stands to take a hit for a few months, but the proposals are such that higher consumption will ensure that collections bounce back to current levels.The changes in GST are also seen to be critical to boost domestic demand, and make up for some of the hit that some businesses may face due to the 50% import duty slapped by the US on India's exports.Sitharaman also urged banks to expand credit, fund infrastructure and MSMEs. ""The guiding principles for this transformation must be trust, technology and transparency."" she noted.She also said that scheduled commercial banks have seen a massive improvement in their asset quality. ""The macro stress tests that we do have shown such results that the scheduled commercial banks' aggregate capital levels will continue to remain above regulatory minimum even under these adverse stress scenarios,"" she said.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman says proposed reforms in eight-year-old indirect tax will make economy absolutely open and transparent.

CAD outlook: Report predicts deficit to nearly double in FY26; projected at 1.2% of GDP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cad-outlook-report-predicts-deficit-to-nearly-double-in-fy26-projected-at-1-2-of-gdp/articleshow/123668770.cms,"AI image





India’s current account deficit (CAD) could almost double in the ongoing financial year to 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with 0.6 per cent in FY25, amid rising trade and geopolitical tensions, according to a report by Union Bank of India.As per news agency ANI, the report pointed out that India’s merchandise trade deficit widened sharply to $27.35 billion in July 2025 from $18.7 billion in June, signalling that the CAD may expand further in the second quarter of FY26. “CAD may almost double to 1.2 per cent of GDP amid trade & geopolitical tensions,” it stated.A key concern is the recent US tariff hike, with duties raised by 50 per cent from August 27.According to the report, this move is expected to disrupt exports in key sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery, auto components, chemicals, and shrimps. It noted that the full impact of these disruptions would need close monitoring in the coming months.The report highlighted that India’s current account balance remains highly sensitive to oil prices, with every $10 per barrel movement in crude impacting the annual CAD by nearly $15 billion. It also underlined the role of global commodity prices, particularly oil and metals, in shaping India’s external position.Geopolitical risks and tariff concerns are expected to continue weighing on trade, though any trade agreements signed with the US or Europe could help ease the pressure. The report added that lower oil prices, if sustained, could provide significant support to CAD dynamics.At the same time, services exports and remittances have so far remained resilient. As per ANI, services exports rose to $97.4 billion in the first quarter of FY26, up from $88.5 billion a year ago, while remittances increased to $33.2 billion from $28.6 billion.The Crisil report cited by ANI also noted that India’s CAD had narrowed sharply in Q1FY26 to $2.4 billion, or 0.2 per cent of GDP, compared with $8.6 billion, or 0.9 per cent of GDP, in the same period last year, aided by strong service inflows. Financial flows were net positive at $13.2 billion, supporting foreign exchange reserves, though inflows were lower than the year-ago period.The Union Bank of India report cautioned that while services exports and remittances could deliver positive surprises, persistent trade tensions pose a downside risk to growth.","India’s current account deficit (CAD) could almost double in the ongoing financial year to 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with 0.6 per cent in FY25.

Citigroup has a buy on Nuvoco Vistas with the target price at Rs 475. Analysts said that the company has announced plans to add 4 million tonne/annum (MTPA) cement grinding capacity in East at a minimal capex of Rs 200 crore, largely through debottlenecking. Together with the ongoing restart of acquired Vadraj assets, this would take the company’s total capacity to 35MTPA. Cement price hikes have helped elevate Nuvoco’s earnings. The company also appears to be focusing on volumes and likely gained market share in April-June quarter (Q1FY26). Channel checks indicate that prices have largely sustained at 1Q exit levels through Jul-Aug. Slowing pace of capacity addition in the East/Central likely suggest limited medium term pricing pressure, which should help Nuvoco’s balance sheet and funding of the Vadraj acquisition.Motilal Oswal Securities upgraded Phoenix Mills to buy with the target price at Rs 2,044. Analysts said commissioning of new malls to drive growth beyond FY27. They estimated 21% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in retail rental income over FY25-27 to reach Rs 2,800 crore by FY27, while office portfolio would surge by about three times and the hotel segment to benefit from strong momentum.HSBC has a buy recommendation on Bharti Airtel with the target price at Rs 2,200. Analysts said the company’s growth levers are intact with rising mobile average revenue per user (ARPU), expanding home broadband subscribers, rising free cash flow and growth in dividends.CLSA has an outperform rating on Bajaj Finance with the target price at Rs 1,150. Analysts said that the company's AI-led initiatives remain a key focus, with 100 use cases to be deployed in FY26. These will help enhance operational efficiency, improve cross-selling revenue and are expected to lower the cost-to-income ratio. They also said that the impact of repo rate cuts has started flowing through, and management expects 10 basis points net interest margin (NIM) expansion over the year from current levels. In the SME financing segment, the company has started trimming growth to curtail any asset quality issues.Nuvama has a buy rating on Asian Paints with the target price at Rs 2,935. Analysts said that the company’s priority is to protect market share with 18–20% EBITDA margin in the medium-to-long term. Demand for its products is stabilising and a gradual revival is likely. The company is witnessing strong rural demand while its urban markets are showing steady signs of recovery. They also said that Asian Paints’ competition is rationalising. Raw material costs are benign and likely to stay stable through FY26.

NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday expressed hope that India will conclude the proposed bilateral trade agreement with the US by Fall or Nov this year.He said that ""a little bit"" of geopolitical issues overtook the trade matters in the negotiations for the pact between the two countries. ""I do hope that things will get back on track soon and we will conclude a bilateral trade agreement by Fall, Nov or so, as was discussed by our two leaders in Feb,"" Goyal said at the Annual Global Investor Conference 2025 in Mumbai.He said there was excitement across the world to expand trading and business relations with India.

With the US, we are in dialogue with them on a BTA,"" he told a CII gathering earlier in the day. Talks are currently at a standstill after the US postponed a trip of negotiators scheduled for Aug-end.Asked about the recent discussions with China and prospects of relaxation in FDI rules, Goyal said: ""This was an SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation) summit (attended by PM Narendra Modi), where all the SCO members participated. We had a problem in Galwan, due to which we had a blip in relationship.

NEW DELHI: India had moved the World Trade Organisation, questioning the 50% tariff imposed by the Trump administration on certain copper products imported into the US.""India considers that the measure, although claimed to be taken for security interests, are, in essence, a safeguard measure,"" it said in a communication to the Geneva-based global trade watchdog on Tuesday, arguing that the US did not notify to WTO its decision on the safeguard measure.A safeguard measure is a temporary levy to protect domestic industry from a sudden surge in imports. Typically, such an action has to be preceded by a probe. The US has cited emergency powers vested with the president to impose tariffs. Apart from reciprocal tariffs, Trump has imposed product-specific duties such as those on copper, iron and steel and aluminium products as well as automobiles and auto parts.India has sought consultations with the US at WTO in what could be a precursor to a formal dispute being initiated although Trump and his predecessors have made the dispute settlement mechanism useless.","India has moved the World Trade Organisation, questioning the 50% tariff imposed by the Trump administration.

NEW DELHI: Almost three-and-a-half years after govt embarked on a plan to kick-start semiconductor manufacturing and supplier ecosystem in India, the country got its first commercially-made chip, which was presented to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Tuesday at Semicon India.The QFP (quad flat package) chip will be used across industries such as consumer electronics (on products like refrigerators, washing machines and air conditioners) and automobiles (for steering control, side-view mirror, engine control unit etc).The chip has been packaged at factory of CG Semi - a JV between CG Power & Industrial and Japanese Renesas & Thailand's Stars Micro - at Sanand in Gujarat. CG Semi's project has a cumulative investment of Rs 7,600 crore and its facility is India's first end-to-end semiconductor OSAT (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test) facility. It is one of the key projects under govt's Rs 76,000 crore India Semiconductor Mission.Vaishnaw said the development marks a major milestone for India's semiconductor ambitions, and added that work on other chip projects has been progressing at a healthy pace, including the Micron memory fab testing and packaging facility in Gujarat.Sivakumar S Nadarajan, senior GM for assembly at CG Semi, said the QFP package is a microcontroller which controls automation across devices.""For example, when you put clothes in a washing machine, the microcontroller decides the next actions based on the weight of the clothes. It will send signals and decide how long do the clothes need to be washed, how long should be the spinning, and when to use water and when to stop it. This chip will be controlling these crucial functions automatically.""Nadarajan said there are two factories in Sanand for the chips. ""The first G1 facility which was inaugurated in late Aug has a capacity of producing 0.5 million units per day. The new bigger G2 facility will have a capacity of 14 million units per day.""The chips are made after the semiconductor wafers are shipped in by Renesas. ""We package it as per the requirements of our customers and then send them back.

NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday said that India and the US are in talks for a trade deal that could be finalised by November this year, further acknowledging that ""a little bit of geopolitical"" issues have overtaken the discussions.""I do hope that things will get back on track soon and we will conclude a bilateral trade agreement by the fall, November or so, as was discussed by our two leaders in February,"" Goyal said while addressing the Annual Global Investor Conference 2025 in Mumbai.""We have had a little bit of geopolitical issues overtaking trade issues in our negotiations with the United States of America,"" he added.The remarks come amid heightened trade tensions after US President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods, accusing New Delhi of indirectly financing the Russia-Ukraine war through crude oil imports from Moscow.Acknowledging challenges, the minister added, ""We have had a little bit of geopolitical issues overtaking trade issues in our negotiations with the United States of America.”Despite hurdles, Goyal noted growing global interest in India as a trade and investment partner.""Lots happen, lots more to go...With the US, we are in dialogue with them on a BTA,"" he said earlier today at another industry chamber event on sustainability.India, he stressed, has drawn ""red lines"" in the negotiations, refusing to open its agriculture and dairy sectors, while also asserting ""strategic autonomy"" in its trade with Russia.India has already signed free trade agreements with Australia, the UAE, Mauritius, the UK, and the four-nation European bloc EFTA.Negotiations with the US began in March, with five rounds of talks completed so far.Following the implementation of a 50% tariff from August 27, the American delegation postponed their planned visit to India for the subsequent round of talks, which was originally set for August 25.Currently, the dates for the sixth round of negotiations remain undetermined.Last week, an ET report said that India and the US maintain active communication channels to address their current tariff disagreement.Officials have further assured exporters that the situation is transient within their enduring bilateral relationship, advising against undue concern.Discussions regarding the proposed Bilateral Trade Agreement will progress based on mutual consideration of each nation's concerns and non-negotiable parameters.Officials noted, ""The impact (of the tariffs) is unlikely to be as severe as feared given the diversified nature of Indian exports. It is a temporary phase in a long-term relationship.""However, a few days ago US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent struck a reconciliatory note, characterising the India-US relationship as ""very complicated,"" while expressing optimism that ""at the end of the day, we will come together."""," commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said that India and the US are in talks for a trade deal that could be finalised by November this year.

JLR cyberattack: Tata Motors unit says operations severely hit; no customer data stolen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jlr-cyberattack-tata-motors-unit-says-operations-severely-hit-no-customer-data-stolen/articleshow/123660902.cms,"



Jaguar Land Rover, the Tata Motors-owned luxury automaker, said on Tuesday its global retail and production operations have been “severely disrupted” following a cyberattack, forcing the company to shut down systems as a precaution.The UK-based company said it took immediate steps to shut down its systems in a bid to limit the fallout, AFP reported. “At this stage there is no evidence any customer data has been stolen but our retail and production activities have been severely disrupted,” JLR said in a statement, adding that it is “working at pace” to restart global operations.Luxury retailers and auto brands have become frequent targets of cyber gangs. Marks and Spencer was recently hit by an attack that crippled its online services for weeks and cost the retailer £300 million ($402 million). High-end department store Harrods and food chain Co-op have also faced cyber intrusions in recent months.The attack comes as another setback for JLR, which has been grappling with weakened demand and trade headwinds. In April, the automaker halted exports to the United States in response to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, leading to a sharp fall in sales.In July, the company said it would cut up to 500 UK management jobs to reduce costs. While a subsequent trade pact between London and Washington reduced the tariff on UK car exports to 10% from 27.5%, the relief applies only to a quota of 100,000 vehicles annually, leaving JLR with limited scope to recover volumes.",Jaguar Land Rover says its global retail and production operations have been “severely disrupted” following a cyberattack.

Sweden’s “buy now, pay later” financial services firm Klarna said on Tuesday it aims to raise $1.27 billion through an initial public offering in New York, setting a price band of $35 to $37 a share, after an earlier plan was delayed due to market volatility.Klarna had first announced plans for an IPO in November last year, but the listing was pushed back earlier this year as equity markets turned choppy. In its latest statement, the company said the offering would give it a market capitalisation of about $14 billion at the top of the price range, AFP reported.Founded in 2004 by three students, Klarna allows shoppers to pay for purchases up to 30 days later or in four instalments without interest. The firm said it generated a net profit of $21 million in 2024 on revenues of $2.8 billion, with commissions from online retailers forming the bulk of its income, alongside interest earnings on longer-term consumer financing.The IPO will comprise 34.3 million shares, with existing investors accounting for the overwhelming majority of the sale. Around 28.7 million shares will come from early backers exiting part of their holdings, while Danish businessman Anders Holch Povlsen, who owns the Bestseller retail clothing chain, plans to offload about 6.3 million shares.Klarna entered the US market in 2019 and has since grown its presence, but the company’s valuation has seen sharp swings. In 2021, at the height of the pandemic spending boom, Klarna was valued at $45.6 billion. Just a year later, that figure slumped to $6.7 billion as inflation surged, interest rates climbed and investor sentiment towards tech firms soured.The company did not disclose the date of its planned US listing but confirmed that its fresh filing marks a renewed push to tap global capital markets.","Sweden's Klarna aims to raise $1.27 billion through an initial public offering in New York.

Russia on Tuesday said it had signed a legally binding agreement with China to build the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, a project aimed at further strengthening energy and strategic ties between the two countries.The pact was signed during President Vladimir Putin' visit to Beijing, reported AFP.The planned pipeline, which would run through Mongolia, is expected to supply up to 50 billion cubic metres of gas annually, according to Russian state agency TASS.""Today, a very important step has been taken to further strengthen and develop our strategic partnership, to increase reliable supplies of clean energy, natural gas, to China,"" said Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller, according to AFP.He also confirmed that Gazprom and China’s CNPC will increase shipments by 15 percent through the existing Power of Siberia pipeline.The memorandum, however, is not a final contract. Pricing and other key details remain unresolved despite years of negotiations.Still, the announcement highlights Moscow’s pivot to Asia for energy sales, with China and India now replacing Europe as Russia’s biggest customers since the Ukraine war disrupted traditional markets.The deal also comes as US President Donald Trump threatens tariffs on nations buying Russian energy.

Wall Street slid sharply on Tuesday as rising Treasury yields and political uncertainty dragged US stocks further from their recent record highs.The S&P 500 dropped 1.4% in what could be its worst day in a month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 516 points or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.7% by mid-day, though all three indices remain close to their all-time peaks, AP reported.Big Tech names led the sell-off. Nvidia, seen as a bellwether of the artificial intelligence boom, sank 3.6% and was the single biggest drag on the S&P 500. Amazon fell 2.2% and Alphabet dropped 2.5%, with analysts pointing to concerns that valuations in the sector have become stretched.The broader market felt pressure from the bond market, where the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.27% from 4.23% on Friday. Rising yields make bonds more attractive relative to equities, particularly high-priced growth stocks. Globally, longer-term yields have also been climbing amid growing concerns over governments’ ability to service ballooning debt.In the US, bond market sentiment was unsettled further by President Donald Trump’s repeated criticism of the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates sooner. Investors fear that political attacks could undermine the Fed’s independence, reducing its willingness to keep policy tight to contain inflation.Markets also reacted to a federal appeals court ruling late Friday that Trump exceeded his legal authority when announcing sweeping tariffs on nearly every country. While the ruling left the tariffs in place for now, analysts warned the move could increase uncertainty over fiscal revenues and borrowing needs. “Too much uncertainty for us and our customers regarding tariffs and the US/global economy,” one chemical products company told the Institute for Supply Management in its latest survey.That ISM report showed US manufacturing contracted more sharply than economists expected last month, adding to evidence of tariff-induced disruption. The data briefly trimmed Treasury yields and reinforced expectations that the Fed could cut interest rates at its next meeting, with markets already pricing in a move. Friday’s upcoming jobs report is expected to provide the next key signal.Safe-haven demand lifted gold, which jumped 2% after hitting a fresh record. “Tariffs are continuing to make conditions chaotic,” ISM respondents noted, underscoring rising investor demand for havens.On the corporate front, Constellation Brands tumbled 6.9% after warning of weaker demand for high-end beers, particularly among Hispanic consumers, and slashing its profit forecast. Kraft Heinz slumped 7% after announcing plans to split into two companies—one focused on shelf-stable meals including Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese, and the other on cold storage brands like Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. Official names are yet to be revealed.Among gainers, PepsiCo rose 2.1% after activist investor Elliott Management disclosed it had sent proposals to the board urging accelerated growth and stronger financial performance. Elliott is known for pushing for major corporate changes that often boost shareholder returns.Overseas markets mirrored Wall Street’s weakness.

Inflation in the eurozone rose slightly to 2.1% in August from 2% in July, official data showed on Tuesday, fuelling expectations that the European Central Bank (ECB) will keep interest rates unchanged at its policy meeting next week.The EU’s statistics agency Eurostat said the uptick was mainly driven by a smaller fall in energy prices. While energy costs continued to decline, they fell by 1.9% compared with 2.5% in July, AFP reported.Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected inflation to remain at 2%, in line with the ECB’s target.

Why Nestlé sacked its CEO



Who is Philipp Navratil, the new Nestlé CEO?









Swiss food giant Nestlé on Monday sacked its chief executive, Laurent Freixe, with immediate effect after an investigation found he had an “undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate”, in breach of the company’s code of business conduct.Freixe, who joined the firm in 1986, had only been promoted to CEO in September 2024 after leading its Latin America division.Freixe’s exit places him among a growing list of high-profile business leaders forced out over workplace relationships. As per AFP, similar departures include BP’s Bernard Looney in 2023 and McDonald’s Steve Easterbrook in 2019, who were both removed for failing to disclose relationships with colleagues.The company announced that Nespresso chief Philipp Navratil will take over the role.According to news agency AFP, Nestlé’s board launched an inquiry overseen by chairman Paul Bulcke and lead independent director Pablo Isla, supported by external counsel.“The departure of Laurent Freixe follows an investigation into an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate which breached Nestlé's code of business conduct,” the board said in a statement.Bulcke called the decision “necessary”, adding, “Nestlé's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service.”As per The Guardian, Freixe replaced Mark Schneider last year in a surprise switch, tasked with reviving sluggish consumer demand. Nestlé has faced challenges, including falling profits and weak spending in China, while also passing on higher raw material costs to shoppers.The company’s shares dropped nearly a quarter in 2024 but closed slightly higher on Monday at 75.49 Swiss francs.Navratil, who began his career with Nestlé in 2001, rose through senior roles in Central America and Mexico before leading the Nescafé and Starbucks brands globally. He became Nespresso CEO in 2024 and joined the executive board in January 2025.According to Axios, the board praised him for “achieving results in challenging environments” and said he would “accelerate efficiency efforts” without altering Nestlé’s current strategy.","Laurent Freixe, who joined the firm in 1986, had only been promoted to CEO in September 2024 after leading its Latin America division.

Asian stocks opened with modest gains on Tuesday, supported by a rebound in technology and artificial intelligence shares, while oil prices advanced amid growing concerns over supply disruptions linked to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.In equity markets, shares in Japan and South Korea recovered after Monday’s losses, though Australian stocks slipped. US equity-index futures traded lower after Wall Street was closed for the Labour Day holiday.According to Bloomberg, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. surged 19% in Hong Kong, its biggest jump in three years, after reporting triple-digit growth in AI-related product revenue and a 26% rise in cloud sales.The rally lifted the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 0.7%, marking its best session in a week.West Texas Intermediate crude also climbed in early Asian trading, extending gains from recent sessions.

Julia Stewart thought she had done everything right. As president of Applebee’s, she built what she calls a “pretty remarkable” team, doubled the stock price, and put the struggling restaurant chain back on its feet.Confident in her record, she approached the CEO’s office expecting the top job. Instead, she got a blunt “No. Not ever.”That moment, Stewart says, became the turning point of her career.Speaking on the Matthews Mentality Podcast in April 2025, the now–CEO of DineEquity Inc. recalled how the rejection fueled her next big move.“I thought he meant, ‘No, not today,’” Stewart said of the conversation. “But he said, ‘No, not ever.’”The blow was personal. But it didn’t break her. Stewart left Applebee’s and joined IHOP, where she spent five years reviving the brand’s image and performance.Then came the full-circle moment.Stewart led IHOP’s $2.3 billion acquisition of Applebee’s, bringing the chain that once rejected her under her control. “Now, obviously, ultimately, you don’t borrow $2.3 billion for revenge. You just don’t do that. But we did borrow $2.3 billion.We did buy Applebee’s,” she said.One of her first calls? Informing the former Applebee’s CEO, the same one who had denied her the top role, that his services were no longer required.Looking back, Stewart described her business style after that defining chapter: “I became a stone-cold killer.”Her story has since become a corporate legend, proof that sometimes the harshest rejection sets the stage for the most powerful comeback.","Julia Stewart was denied the top job at Applebee's.

The India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed on July 24 by Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Keir Starmer will cut trade tariffs from 15% to 3% and is expected to bolster business confidence in a volatile global environment, British MPs were told on Monday.UK Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds briefed the House of Commons on the pre-ratification process for the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), highlighting its potential impact ahead of full implementation, PTI reported.“This agreement drops the average Indian tariff on UK products from 15% to 3%, with duties falling by around £400 million at entry, rising to £900 million after staging,” Reynolds said. “It is expected to increase bilateral trade by £25.5 billion, raise UK GDP by £4.8 billion, and boost wages by £2.2 billion annually. In an increasingly unstable world, this deal provides businesses with confidence as they grow and expand. ”The FTA secures preferential access to India’s federal procurement market, guarantees opportunities for UK service suppliers, and simplifies trade through improved customs and digital processes, Reynolds added.Specific regional gains include £190 million for the West Midlands and Scotland and £210 million for the North West, supporting the UK’s high-growth sectors.Reynolds also informed MPs about the commissioning of the Trade and Agriculture Commission, the Food Standards Agency, and Food Standards Scotland, whose reports under Section 42 of the Agriculture Act 2020 are needed before Parliament can ratify the agreement.Parallel negotiations on the Double Contribution Convention, agreed alongside the FTA to prevent temporary foreign workers from duplicating social security contributions, will also follow the standard parliamentary process.The India-UK CETA, signed during Modi’s UK visit, aims to double bilateral trade to $120 billion by 2030.

He also added that it was something to celebrate not just for the member states but for the whole region.Although Wang confirmed the decision, he gave no timeline for when the new bank would be established.The proposal had been strongly backed by China for years, with President Xi Jinping earlier urging SCO nations to accelerate the process, PTI reported.In his inaugural address, Xi said the creation of the bank was crucial, given the growing appeal of the 10-nation bloc.China has been pushing for a bank modelled on the New Development Bank (NDB) of the BRICS grouping and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), both of which are based in China.India is the second-largest shareholder in the AIIB.Initially viewed as rivals to the IMF, World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, both banks now work alongside them through co-financing arrangements.Wang also announced that the SCO has approved the admission of Laos as a new partner. At the same time, observer states and dialogue partners will be merged into a single category, the SCO partner, to improve efficiency.“The SCO has an extended family of 27,” Wang said, as quoted by PTI.Founded in 2001 in Shanghai, the SCO now consists of Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, Pakistan, Iran and Belarus.

China and India dominate Russia oil imports





US President Donald Trump has again slammed India for its continued purchase of crude oil and arms from Russia. In a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump said, “India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia, very little from the US. ”The US has imposed a 25% additional tariff on India for its crude oil trade with Russia, accusing India of indirectly financing the war with Ukraine.

""Russia remains one of the most important global fertilizer suppliers and the influence of it has not diminished since 2022.""""Urea and potash could be readily sourced from elsewhere, although with potash it would further increase US dependence on Canada, which currently has an interesting trade dynamic,"" Pickett added.Whilst palladium imports from Russia have decreased notably since 2021, the US imported $878 million worth in 2024 and $594 million worth through June 2025. This silvery metal is essential for electronic and industrial products, particularly in vehicle catalytic converters.Uranium and plutonium imports from Russia to the US reached $755 million in the first half of this year, according to Census data. The previous year's imports of these nuclear materials from Russia totalled $624 million.Russia's position as the EU's primary petroleum supplier changed following its war with Ukraine. Maritime Russian oil and refined products imports faced EU restrictions, causing a significant decline to $1.72 billion in the first quarter of 2025, compared to $16.4 billion in the same period of 2021, as per Eurostat figures quoted in the CNN report.According to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air's analysis, in July 2025, Hungary, France, Slovakia, Belgium and Spain emerged as the principal European importers of Russian fossil fuels. Hungary and Slovakia dominated crude oil imports, whilst others primarily imported liquefied natural gas.Natural gas imports from Russia showed an increase in value over four years due to price rises, reaching $5.23 billion in 2025's first quarter, according to Eurostat. The EU reduced Russia's share in liquefied natural gas imports from 22% to 19% between 2021 and 2025, whilst increasing American imports substantially.Russian iron and steel imports to the EU decreased considerably. First quarter 2025 figures showed imports worth $850 million, approximately half the value from the same period in 2021, as Eurostat reports.Fertiliser imports from Russia remained relatively stable since 2021, unaffected by sanctions and import duties. EU nations imported Russian fertiliser worth $640 million in 2025's first quarter.The EU diversified its nickel sourcing, increasing imports from the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom and Canada. Nevertheless, Russian nickel imports totalled $300 million in the first quarter of 2025. Nickel serves primarily in stainless steel, alloy steel and battery production.While the EU's trade with Russia has reduced, it is important to note that it has not stopped.Also Read | 'Social Truth' vs data: What Trump doesn’t get about India’s 'dead' economy India's trade with Russia has seen a dramatic surge, with imports reaching $67 billion in 2024, as per United Nations data. The majority, approximately $53 billion, consisted of petroleum oils and crude oil. This marks a significant increase from 2021's figure of $8.7 billion in total imports before the conflict began.According to Vortexa, an energy data firm, Russian oil currently dominates India's market with a 36% share, establishing Russia as India's primary crude oil supplier. This substantial growth in oil and gas imports occurred following the commencement of hostilities.Similarly, China increased its Russian crude oil purchases after 2022, taking advantage of reduced prices resulting from Western nations curtailing their Russian fuel imports. Vortexa data indicates that Russian oil comprises 13.5% of China's crude imports. UN-aggregated figures show China's total Russian imports reached $130 billion in 2024, with petroleum oils and crude accounting for $62.6 billion.Both India and China have maintained that the source of crude oil procurement is a matter of strategic autonomy.In response to Trump’s additional 25% tariffs on India for its crude oil trade with Russia, the ministry of external affairs has said, “The United States has in recent days targeted India’s oil imports from Russia. We have already made clear our position on these issues, including the fact that our imports are based on market factors and done with the overall objective of ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people of India. It is therefore extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest. We reiterate that these actions are unfair, unjustified and unreasonable. India will take all actions necessary to protect its national interests.”Also Read | India's holdings of US Treasury bill down!

"SCO meet: How Modi, Putin, Xi flipped Trump’s tariff gambit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/sco-meet-how-modi-putin-xi-flipped-trumps-tariff-gambit-reverse-nixon/articleshow/123638028.cms,"Modi & Putin Unfazed By Trump's Tariff Tactics; After China, Russian President To Visit India

“The Nixon paradigm did work in reverse, but differently from what the US had thought; that is, Moscow played Washington this time,” said Francesco Sisci, Director at the Appia Institute.

Why it matters

The optics and sequence matter. Trump aimed to repeat Nixon’s 1972 diplomatic masterstroke - opening China to isolate the USSR. In today’s reversed context, Trump sought to lure Russia away from China to break the tightening autocratic alliance that challenges US primacy.

Instead, Putin may have pulled the ultimate diplomatic jiu-jitsu: using the US initiative as leverage to tighten his grip on both China and India, positioning Russia as the pivot between the world’s three most powerful non-Western nations.

“If Trump and Xi wind up competing for Putin’s attention, the Russian leader could play the US and China off each other, to his own benefit,” Bonnie Glaser of the German Marshall Fund told Atlantic.

The result could fracture not only US-India ties, but the broader Western alliance network painstakingly built since the Cold War.

Nixon’s legacy, reversed?

“The one thing you never want to happen is… Russia and China uniting,” Trump said in October. “I’m going to have to un-unite them, and I think I can do that.”

Zoom in: India’s pivot - or power play?

“Even in the most difficult situations, India and Russia have always walked shoulder to shoulder,” Modi said in Tianjin. “Our Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership remains a vital pillar of regional and global stability.”

The bottom line





On the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in China's Tianjin, leaders from India, China, and Russia projected an image of warmth and strategic convergence that is bound to rattle Washington. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Russia a “special and privileged partner.” Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that “the world’s two most populous countries need to be friends.” And Russian President Vladimir Putin clasped Modi’s hand, addressed him as “dear friend,” and whisked him away in his armoured Aurus limousine.The optics told a story of deepening chemistry: Xi and Modi smiling together after years of tension, Modi leaning into Moscow even as Trump slapped tariffs on Indian goods, and Putin positioning himself as the indispensable broker of this triangular courtship.At Tianjin, Russian President Putin may have executed a geopolitical manoeuvre that turns US Cold War strategy on its head - a “Reverse Nixon” - not by peeling away China, but by deepening his ties with both Beijing and New Delhi, at the expense of US President Donald Trump and American influence.The move was subtle but seismic. While Trump met Putin in Alaska on August 15 to persuade him to drift from China's orbit, Beijing welcomed PM Modi just two weeks later.On August 30, Modi was in Beijing. The next day, he stood smiling next to Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin - a public relations coup for Beijing and Moscow.In 1972, then US President Richard Nixon’s bold gamble to meet Chinese leader Mao Zedong shifted the Cold War balance. It exploited the Sino-Soviet split, reoriented the global chessboard, and paved the way for China’s eventual market reforms. Today, Trump seeks to flip that strategy - to drive a wedge between Russia and China.On paper, the logic works. As Marco Rubio warned, letting Russia become “a permanent junior partner to China” creates a two-headed nuclear-armed threat. But the execution is where Trump’s strategy unravelled.It seems that the weakest link in Trump’s plan wasn’t Russia or China. It was India. For over two decades, successive US administrations-Democratic and Republican-have painstakingly cultivated ties with New Delhi. Trump, in a single month, may have undone much of that progress.According to a report in the New York Times, the final straw for PM Modi wasn’t tariffs or oil sanctions. It was a phone call. Trump reportedly pressed Modi to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize, claiming his efforts to mediate between India and Pakistan deserved global recognition. The ask was seen in New Delhi as not only tone-deaf, but borderline insulting.PM Modi responded with actions, not words. Time and again, he has talked about India’s multi-alignment strategy. The series of meetings and conversations - Xi, Putin, a call to Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy - sent a clear signal: New Delhi is not lining up behind Washington, especially if it’s led by an unpredictable partner.At the same summit, Modi and Putin took a private ride in Putin’s armored Aurus limousine - a symbolic show of closeness. Russia and India aim to boost bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030. For now, Russia supplies nearly 37% of India’s oil imports - a staggering increase from just a few years ago.India may still walk a middle path - but its sudden warmth toward Beijing and Moscow complicates US strategy across the Indo-Pacific. Quad unity is fraying, and US tariffs (now 50%) on Indian goods haven’t helped.“India can return happily to having the Russian cake and eating the American pie,” said Sreeram Sundar Chaulia of Jindal School of International Affairs. But only if Washington reestablishes trust.Putin didn’t break with Xi - he broke the illusion that Trump could drive a wedge between America’s rivals. In trying to execute a Nixonian pivot, Trump misjudged the players, misread the timing, and underestimated how much his erratic behavior would cost.Rather than weakening America’s adversaries, he has made Russia the pivot power, emboldened Xi, and pushed India into recalibration mode.For all the talk of multipolarity and realignment, one fact remains: the US cannot afford to lose India. Nor can it afford to hand Putin the strategic initiative.If America cannot restore trust with New Delhi-and fast-it risks unraveling the post-WWII alliance structure that has held global instability in check. And unlike Nixon, who reshaped history by reading his adversaries correctly, Trump may be reshaping it by misreading the moment entirely.(With inputs from agencies)","In 1972, then US President Richard Nixon’s bold gamble to meet Chinese leader Mao Zedong shifted the Cold War balance.

‘Without Tariffs...': Trump's Fresh Rant After Putin, Modi, Xi Unite At SCO Amid U.S Trade Tantrums





US President Donald Trump’s plan to impose steep import taxes on pharmaceuticals — some as high as 200% — is drawing sharp warnings from industry experts who fear it could push up drug prices in the United States and trigger shortages, according to an AP report.Trump, who has already levied tariffs on products ranging from autos to steel, now wants to extend them to medicines — a sector that for decades has mostly entered the US duty-free. A recent trade deal with Europe has already set a 15% tariff on certain drugs, and the president has threatened far higher duties on imports from elsewhere.“Shock and awe is how this industry is going from zero (tariffs) to the potential of 200%,” Maytee Pereira of PwC told AP.Healthcare analysts say such a move could undermine Trump’s pledge to cut drug prices. “A tariff would hurt consumers most of all, as they would feel the inflationary effect ... directly when paying for prescriptions at the pharmacy and indirectly through higher insurance premiums,” wrote Diederik Stadig of ING, adding that low-income households and the elderly would be most exposed.Though Trump has suggested a one-year delay to give drugmakers time to stockpile or shift production to the US, analysts told AP the impact could still hit by 2027 or 2028 as inventories run down.Stadig warned that even a 25% levy could gradually raise US drug prices by 10–14%.Drugmakers have increasingly offshored production to countries such as China, India, Ireland and Switzerland, leaving the US with a nearly $150 billion trade deficit in pharmaceuticals last year. Analysts noted that 97% of antibiotics, 92% of antivirals and 83% of top generic drugs rely on at least one active ingredient manufactured abroad.“The only way to truly protect yourself from the tariffs would be to build the supply chain end to end in the United States,” Pereira said.While some global players such as Roche and Johnson & Johnson have announced multibillion-dollar US investments, experts told AP that generics — which make up 92% of prescriptions — could be hardest hit. Marta Wosinska of Brookings said generic manufacturers may exit the US market rather than bear costs, warning that even small supply shocks, as seen in past cancer drug shortages, can cripple patient care.“In an ideal world, we would be making everything that’s important only in the US,” Wosinska said. “But it costs a lot of money ... If we want to reverse this, we would really have to redesign our system. How much are we willing to spend?”","US President Donald Trump's plan to impose steep import taxes on pharmaceuticals is drawing sharp warnings.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran





THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

Golden Visa Benefits:

In today's uncertain and dynamic global environment, affluent individuals seek alternative arrangements for themselves and their loved ones - arrangements that provide secure havens during turbulent times whilst enabling enhanced access to worldwide commercial and lifestyle prospects.

Golden visas serve as strategic tools for affluent individuals seeking to safeguard their wealth and enhance their global mobility. These programmes are said to offer a reliable safeguard against economic and political uncertainties in an unstable global environment.

The golden visa scheme enables high net worth persons to establish residence in financially advantageous jurisdictions whilst securing comprehensive residential rights, including access to employment, educational institutions and healthcare facilities in the host country.

Some Available Golden Visa Programmes for Indians

According to an ET report, despite tightening regulations, Indian applicants can still access several golden visa schemes:

Portugal continues to offer residency through investments in qualified funds, scientific research initiatives, or business expansion projects.

Greece has adjusted its programme, raising the real estate investment threshold to €400,000, whilst offering a €250,000 alternative route through local startup investments.

Spain's scheme remains accessible to investors who submitted applications prior to 2024, despite plans to discontinue the programme.

Malta maintains its citizenship by investment option, subject to thorough background checks.

Various Caribbean nations, including St. Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and Saint Lucia, provide passports for investments beginning at $200,000.

The UAE golden visa programme continues to welcome Indian investors and professionals from essential sectors, including healthcare, technology, and business.

Singapore's Global Investor Program, whilst not technically a golden visa, enables permanent residency through substantial local business investments.

Golden visa programmes: Countries around the world are strengthening restrictions on unauthorised immigration, whilst maintaining pathways for investment-based residency. Investment visa schemes provide opportunities to obtain residential status or nationality through monetary commitments. Although traditionally popular amongst Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern investors, these programmes now draw applicants from across the globe.Golden visas allow for investment-linked residency on a temporary or permanent basis. These are linked to applicants making qualifying financial contributions, including property acquisition, enterprise establishment or state fund deposits. The flexible residency requirements of certain programmes appeal to those seeking alternative options whilst retaining freedom of movement.A golden visa programme is a legal pathway where qualified individuals receive residential privileges in a country by making specified financial investments. This differs from citizenship-by-investment schemes, which provide complete citizenship benefits. Through golden visas, wealthy individuals can obtain legal residency status, allowing them to live, pursue employment, education and access healthcare services in their chosen nation.Nations increasingly provide residence and citizenship through investment schemes such as golden visa programmes, featuring diverse investment choices tailored to individual family needs.Golden passports provide ""citizenship by investment”. They deliver comprehensive citizenship privileges, frequently including admission to regional economic zones. Within the European Union, Malta's scheme enables investors to live, work and pursue education across all EU member states. In the Caribbean region, nations including St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Grenada provide competitive options beginning at approximately $200,000.US President Donald Trump has introduced the ""gold card"" scheme as a replacement for the existing EB-5 visa system. This initiative would grant residency rights and citizenship prospects in exchange for a $5 million investment. Unlike the current EB-5 programme, the proposed scheme suggests direct payment to the US government to address national debt. This arrangement could present an alternative solution for Indian investors facing extensive waiting periods in the current employment-based green card system.",Golden visas allow for investment-linked residency on a temporary or permanent basis.

In February, the vegetarian thali saw a reduction in cost compared to the previous year, whilst the non-vegetarian thali showed an increase due to higher broiler prices.

The vegetarian thali saw a 1% reduction year-on-year in February, whereas the non-vegetarian thali registered an increase of approximately 6%:

The reduction in vegetarian thali cost was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder

was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder Tomato prices reduced to Rs 23/kg from Rs 32/kg, showing a 28% decrease year-on-year, due to 20% increased supply

LPG costs decreased by 11% year-on-year (to Rs 803 per 14.2 kg cylinder in Delhi from Rs 903) providing additional savings

The decline would have been more substantial if not for the increased prices of onion (11%), potato (16%) and vegetable oil (18%) year-on-year, says CRISIL.

In some relief for the common man, the cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali declined year-on-year in February, according to CRISIL’s latest monthly indicator of food plate cost, RRR (Roti Rice Rate). The cost of a non-vegetarian thali, however grew approximately 6% due to rise in broiler (chicken) prices, the report said. On a month-on-month basis the cost of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian thalis came down.The calculation of an average thali's preparation cost at home by CRISIL considers input prices across different regions of India. Monthly variations indicate the impact on everyday household expenses. The analysis tracks price movements of essential ingredients including cereals, pulses, broilers, vegetables, spices, edible oil and cooking gas.The rise in non-vegetarian thali prices was primarily due to a 15% year-on-year increase in broiler (chicken) prices. Broiler (chicken), which constitutes approximately 50% of a non-vegetarian thali's cost, saw this increase due to previous year's low baseline when prices had fallen because of oversupply.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know Additionally, higher feed expenses, resulting from a 6% year-on-year increase in maize prices, contributed to the overall cost surge.During the month, both vegetarian and nonvegetarian thali costs decreased by 5% compared to the previous month. This reduction was attributed to fresh supplies causing price drops in onion (7%), potato (17%), and tomato (25%). Additionally, broiler (chicken) prices fell by an estimated 5% month-on-month due to reduced demand following bird flu concerns in southern India.","In February, the vegetarian thali saw a reduction in cost compared to the previous year.

Stock market today : BSE Sensex and Nifty50 , the Indian equity benchmark indices, ended the trading session in green on Monday, driven by strong performance in banking and automobile sectors, with ICICI Bank and Axis Bank leading. Positive global market conditions supported the bullish trend.The S&P BSE Sensex finished at 74,169.95, rising by 341.04 points or 0.46%, whilst the broader Nifty50 closed at 22,508.75, advancing by 111.55 points or 0.5%.The Nifty index showed a predominant positive trend, with 33 stocks recording gains and 17 experiencing declines.Dr Reddy's Laboratories, SBI Life Insurance, Bajaj Finserv, Trent and Axis emerged as the top gainers, whilst Wipro, Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), Hero MotoCorp, ITC and Nestle India were the top losers.Global market uncertainties and potential US recession concerns could affect domestic market momentum this week. Nevertheless, experts indicate that recent valuation adjustments, coupled with positive factors including reduced crude oil prices, weakening Dollar Index, and anticipated domestic earnings growth in subsequent quarters, could help stabilize market fluctuations.Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services says, “The near-term market trend is likely to be stable with a positive bias. The positive factors are the steadily declining trend in FII outflows and the outperformance of India over the US last week. This positive trend has fundamental support from the bounce back in FY25 Q3 GDP growth to 6.2%, the spurt in January IIP to 5%, and the decline in February CPI inflation to 3.61%. This positive macro backdrop can support the market in the short-term but cannot sustain a rally in the market. The trade war fears are looming large on global trade and global growth. The uncertainty surrounding the reciprocal tariffs kicking in from April 2nd will certainly weigh on markets. India dubbed the ‘tariff King’ and ‘tariff abuser’ is unlikely to be spared by Trump. This will keep the market jittery, particularly the export oriented sectors will be anxious about the tariff announcements.

Stock market today : Indian equity benchmark indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50, opened in green on Tuesday. While BSE Sensex opened over 400 points up, Nifty50 was above 22,600. At 9:16 AM, BSE Sensex was trading at 74,580.59, up 411 points or 0.55%. Nifty50 was at 22,634.45, up 126 points or 0.56%.Indian markets advanced on Monday following positive global market sentiment, with US markets showing recovery on Friday and Asian markets closing higher due to China's consumption boost plans. Investors await crucial interest rate decisions from the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan on Wednesday, followed by the Bank of England on Thursday.Experts anticipate the Federal Reserve to maintain current interest rates, continuing its previous meeting's position, considering potential inflation risks from US tariff policies.Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services says, “Broad indications are that the market has bottomed out even though further corrections cannot be completely ruled out. Positive domestic cues like rebound on FY25 Q3 GDP growth to 6.2%, spurt in the IIP by 5.1%, increase in gross tax collection by 16%, declining trade deficit and more importantly decline in CPI inflation to 3.6% are positive macro trends which augur well for the market. But these domestic tailwinds are not strong enough to take the market to higher levels on a sustained basis since the global headwinds from tariff wars will counter the domestic tailwinds.

NEW DELHI: Starlink is likely to face a spectrum tax in India, which had been abolished for terrestrial network providers, such as Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea a few years back, sources said. The tax, if imposed, will increase service costs for Elon Musk-run satcom venture in India.The move will be another challenge for the American satellite major, which is negotiating stiff compliance mandates related to internet suspension and interception. .Sources told TOI that Starlink, which will be allotted telecom airwaves through administrative allocation (in line with the new Telecom Law passed in Dec 2023), will need to cough up around 3% spectrum usage charge (SUC) on its adjusted gross revenue from the country.""Since spectrum will be 'administratively assigned' to satellite operators instead of auction, SUC will be applicable, for which final rates are being worked upon,"" one of the sources said.This will mean that apart from 8% licence fee, that all telcos need to pay, satcom players will be required to shell out an additional charge for spectrum. ""It may even be higher than 3%, though this is still being discussed.""The matter related to the pricing of satellite spectrum, its tenure and other taxation is currently being finalised by regulator Trai. ""Discussions within Trai are believed to have come to the conclusion that there is a requirement to mandate SUC for satcom players, since they will be allotted spectrum administratively at a pre-determined price,"" the source added.Trai is likely to submit its recommendations on the issue of satcom spectrum allocation soon, and these will then be considered by the department of telecom (DoT). After analysis of the recommendations, DoT may raise further queries on the matter with specific references. Once satisfied, DoT will take up the matter with the inter-ministerial Digital Communications Commission (DCC). After DCC's approval, it will be taken up by the Cabinet.In June 2022, govt had taken a decision to remove SUC for bandwidth that had been auctioned after Sept 15, 2021 across different frequencies.Sources said SUC will also be applicable for other satellite operators, such as Eutelsat One Web (where Airtel promoter Sunil Mittal has a stake) and Reliance Jio-SES (satcom JV between Jio Platforms and Luxembourg-based SES).","The tax, if imposed, will increase service costs for Elon Musk-run satcom venture in India.

NEW DELHI: India's trade deficit has narrowed to a 42-month low of $14 billion in Feb 2025, thanks primarily to imports slowing to $51 billion, data released by the commerce ministry showed on Monday. But volatility in petroleum prices and global uncertainties meant that exports last month fell to $36.9 billion, compared to $41.4 billion in the same month last year. In the 11 months of FY25, merchandise and services exports rose 6.2% to $750.5 billion compared to $706.4 billion in the year-ago period.Union commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal said, ""This has been a difficult year in terms of trade. Still, we are on the right track of meeting our target of crossing $800 billion in trade, which was $778 billion last fiscal. Non petroleum products are the key strength of Indian trade and that is growing at over 6%. Except gems and jewellery, all key sectors are growing well. Our focus is on increasing services sector, which has grown at 14%. Overall exports are doing well.""ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said, ""Merchandise trade deficit compressed to $14.1 billion in Feb 2025 from $19.5 billion in Feb 2024, largely explained by a compression in imports of oil, gold and silver. A portion of the year-on-year decline in merchandise exports can be attributed to the base year effect related to the leap month. The trade deficit was also significantly lower than the average of over $23 billion during the first 10 months of FY25. We expect current account to witness a surplus of $5 billion in Q4 FY25 in the ongoing quarter.""","India's trade deficit has narrowed to a 42-month low of $14 billion in Feb 2025.

NEW DELHI: American aerospace major Boeing will increase its sourcing from India, which is currently at Rs 10,000 crore annually from about 320 suppliers here, as it emerges from its worst ever crisis. While Indian airline customers will get two aircraft per month this year and next, its plans for India go beyond planes. Boeing's senior VP Brendan Nelson is in India and shared with TOI the company's plans here. Excerpts:On the commercial side, our deliveries are increasing. We're capped at 38 a month on the B737 MAX (which accounts for a lion's share of orders in India) by the FAA. We expect to get to 38 a month in the first half of this year. That is all being determined by absolutely ensuring the quality and the safety of the products that we're producing.We are confident B787 Dreamliner production will increase from five a month to seven. That is good news for Indian customers both on the 737 and the 787. Air India will get some of the ordered wide body aircraft over the next two years.Linking of airports and the relationship between airports - primary, secondary, regional and so on - is a good illustration of where an original equipment manufacturer's commitment to a country really lies. Selling commercial airplanes and defence platforms is extremely important. But if that is all we do for India, then we are not serving India's interests.We have eight decades of partnership with India. We don't see India as a transactional relationship. So these investments in airports; training of pilots, technicians, ground crews; MROs; in our JV Tata Boeing Aerospace; on the Apaches; in Boeing Engineering India Technology Centre in Bangalore and Chennai are critically important investment in India's future and through it of course in Boeing's future.We've got about 320 suppliers in India who provide very high quality components and parts. A quarter of those are small businesses, which is also extremely important. So, the spend is about $1.3 billion a year on Indian suppliers. And the extent to which that grows will depend on how many planes we produce. Our backlog is 5,500 planes.India is an emergent superpower. The reforms that have been undertaken in India make it a very attractive place for companies like us. Strengthening our presence in India and supporting India's strength, strengthens us in the US. Good for Boeing and good for the bilateral relationship.It will be some time before there is a demand in the region to justify the business case for a final assembly line.","Boeing will increase its sourcing from India, which is currently at Rs 10,000 crore annually from about 320 suppliers.

MUMBAI: RBI has pumped in over Rs 5 lakh crore into the banking system since mid-Jan through bond purchases, forex swaps and early-April maturity repos. To ensure that liquidity remains surplus so that its rate cut can be transmitted to borrowers, the central bank plans to inject another Rs 50,000 crore through bond repurchases on Tuesday.Although a 25-basis-point cut in repo rate in February brought relief to homebuyers, neither the cut nor the record liquidity has reduced cost of funds for corporate borrowers. This is because the interest rate for corporates depends on the one-year marginal cost of lending rates, which reflects that cost at which banks raise funds. The one-year MCLR for the country's top lender State Bank of India has been rock steady at 9% - the highest level since RBI started raising rates.While the central bank has undertaken record liquidity infusion, the reaction of money markets has been muted largely because of year-end demand for funds and the rise in yields globally. Banks are reluctant to reduce interest rates on term deposits because credit growth (9.5% until end-Feb) continues to outstrip deposit growth (8.8%).Since RBI reduce the repo rate no major bank has brought down its deposit rate. The lowering of FD rates has been done largely by some small finance banks who have been reassessing their growth targets given the stress in the sector. Currently there are seven small finance banks and four private banks offering over 8% rates on the fixed deposits.Second, even as RBI infuses record liquidity, it continues to drain rupees out of the banking system by selling dollars from its forex reserves. This sale of dollars has helped stabilise the system and the liquidity measures have helped address immediate shortages, but they have not yet fully succeeded in reducing short-term interest rates due to ongoing liquidity deficits and economic uncertainties.With the year-end pressure to lend, bankers say that cost of funds will decline in the first quarter of FY26.","RBI has pumped in over Rs 5 lakh crore into the banking system since mid-Jan.

"How to deal with Trump: Flattery, retaliation, or holding out?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-to-deal-with-trump-flattery-retaliation-or-holding-out/articleshow/119121261.cms,"Trump has consistently portrayed himself as an excellent dealmaker.

Why it matters

Trump’s America First approach is forcing allies to rethink their economic and military dependencies. Countries that once assumed Washington was a reliable partner are now questioning whether Trump’s transactional style leaves them vulnerable.

Economic risks: Retaliatory tariffs could escalate into a full-scale trade war, disrupting supply chains and rattling financial markets.

Retaliatory tariffs could escalate into a full-scale trade war, disrupting supply chains and rattling financial markets. Diplomatic d ilemmas: Nations must decide whether to challenge Trump’s rhetoric publicly or attempt to negotiate exemptions quietly.

Nations must decide whether to challenge Trump’s rhetoric publicly or attempt to negotiate exemptions quietly. Security concerns: Trump’s threats to Nato and his unpredictable foreign policy approach have left many allies, particularly in Europe, rethinking their military strategies.

The big picture

1. Canada’s aggressive retaliation

When Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada struck back with tariffs on US goods and a fee hike on electricity exports to the US.

imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada struck back with tariffs on US goods and a fee hike on electricity exports to the US. Trump responded with threats to double Canada’s tariffs, sparking a fiery exchange with Ontario Premier Doug Ford . Both sides eventually walked back their actions, but tensions remain high.

. Both sides eventually walked back their actions, but tensions remain high. The risk? The confrontation led to economic instability, with Canadian markets reacting negatively to the trade war, the Politico report said.

2. Mexico’s quiet diplomacy

Unlike Canada, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has avoided retaliatory measures and has instead sought behind-the-scenes negotiations.

Sheinbaum has held off on retaliating against Trump’s fentanyl-related tariffs and the new steel and aluminum tariffs, hoping to negotiate exemptions.

The risk? Mexico’s passive approach has yet to yield major wins, and Trump’s administration still sees Mexico as an easy target, the Politico report added.

3. Europe’s coordinated response

The EU is retaliating in phases, announcing a two-stage tariff plan targeting $28 billion in US goods, set to begin on April 1.

Trump falsely claimed on Truth Social that the EU had already implemented a 50% tariff on whiskey, vowing to hit French wines and champagnes with a 200% tariff in response.

The risk? A full-scale trade war between the EU and the US could disrupt global markets and deepen the economic divide between Western allies.

4. China’s strategic patience?

Unlike other countries, China’s rhetoric has been high but response has been measured, allowing space for negotiations.

Beijing is believed to be pursuing a new trade deal, similar to the 2020 agreement during Trump’s first term.

The risk? A full-blown US-China trade war would really hit the world economy hard.

5. The UK and Japan’s cautious approach

The UK has refused to retaliate, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer sending trade officials to Washington to negotiate exemptions.

Japan and Australia are following a similar path, opting for quiet diplomacy instead of direct confrontation.

The risk? While this approach may prevent economic escalation, it also allows Trump to set the terms of the trade dispute unchallenged.

6. India: A different approach

India’s approach reflects a strategic blend of diplomacy, economic pragmatism, and a focus on safeguarding its domestic interests. Recent moves like slashing motorcycle tariffs and dropping retaliatory duties on US agricultural goods in 2023 signal India’s willingness to make concessions to de-escalate tensions.

At the same time, India is engaged in active bilateral negotiations, aiming to finalize a mutually beneficial trade agreement.

What they are saying

William Reinsch, former US commerce official, told Politico: “Is it better to grovel and kiss the ring or stand up to the bully? Both have worked on occasion and both have failed. So it’s hard to know in any given circumstance which one is the better tactic.”

EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic: “There’s still time for the US to settle this without unnecessary pain.”

Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick: “Europe and Canada do not respect Trump or America’s ability to build its steel and aluminum industry.”

Mexico’s former US ambassador, Arturo Sarukhán: “More aggressive responses, like Canada’s and the EU’s, could backfire.”

Between the lines

Not only tariffs, Trump’s Nato stance is also alarming US allies. His remark that he would “encourage” Russia to attack Nato members who fail to meet defense spending targets has left European nations deeply concerned.

Meanwhile, Canada is pivoting towards Europe. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first foreign visit was to France and the UK, signaling a shift away from dependence on the US.

Germany is increasing defense spending to counter Trump’s unpredictability, committing billions to military expansion in response to his Nato skepticism.

Germany has announced historic defense spending, breaking from its post-WWII reluctance.

Some European leaders are considering an independent nuclear deterrent, possibly involving France and the UK.

Canada is reinforcing its Arctic presence, fearing Trump’s annexation rhetoric.

What’s next

April 2 is the next flashpoint. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs will take effect, potentially triggering more retaliatory measures.

Canada and the EU may accelerate new trade alliances to reduce dependence on the US.

Mexico’s wait-and-see strategy could pay off if Trump offers exemptions, but risks looking weak.

Nato members may push for alternative defense structures, anticipating further US disengagement.

As US President Donald Trump imposes tariffs and shakes up long-standing alliances, world leaders are testing different approaches to dealing with his unpredictable style. From Mexico to Canada to China to EU, different nations and leaders have pursued starkly different strategies with mixed results.With a fresh wave of tariffs on steel and aluminum in effect and more reciprocal tariffs looming in April, other nations are watching closely. Should they retaliate forcefully, like Canada and the EU, or opt for quiet diplomacy, like Mexico and the UK? The answer could determine the global economic and security landscape for years to come.According to a Politico report, countries are adopting different tactics to deal with Trump’s aggressive economic policies, each with its own set of risks and rewards:(With inputs from agencies)",Trump’s America First approach is forcing allies to rethink their economic and military dependencies.

"Will Bitcoin price crash to $20,000? Peter Schiff makes big prediction if Nasdaq enters bear market phase",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/will-bitcoin-price-crash-to-20000-peter-schiff-makes-big-prediction-if-nasdaq-enters-bear-market-phase/articleshow/119107096.cms,"Regarding Bitcoin's potential decline, Schiff observed that with the Nasdaq already showing a 12% decrease.

Below is the full text of Peter Schiff’s post on X:

The NASDAQ is down 12%. If this correction turns out to be a bear market, and the correlation where a 12% decline in the NASDAQ equates to a 24% decline in Bitcoin holds, when the NASDAQ is down 20%, Bitcoin will be about $65K.

But if the NASDAQ goes into a bear market, history shows that the decline will be much larger. Following the bursting of the Dot-com bubble, it fell almost 80%. During the 2008 GFC, it fell 55%, and during the COVID crash in 2020, it fell about 30%. The average of those three bear markets is a 55% decline. If this bear market bottoms with just a 40% decline, that would put Bitcoin at about $20K. However, my bet would be that a drop of that magnitude would accelerate Bitcoin's collapse to much lower levels.

On the other hand, the correlation between the NASDAQ and gold has been negative. Since the NASDAQ peaked on Dec. 16th, 2023, gold is up 13%, almost a perfect 1-to-1 correlation. So, if that correlation holds too, a 40% drop in the NASDAQ would put gold over $3,800. However, my guess is that if a bear market in stocks coincides with a significant decline in the dollar on foreign exchange markets, gold will rise much higher.

But even at $3,800 gold and $20K Bitcoin, in terms of gold, Bitcoin will be down over 85%. Given that such a divergence will likely end the pretense that Bitcoin is a store of value similar to gold, there will clearly be no justification for the U.S. government or any state government to keep any Bitcoin in a Strategic Reserve. There will also be no reason for ETF investors to keep holding their positions either. With all that selling, it will be impossible for $MSTR to sell enough Bitcoin to avoid bankruptcy.

US forecasts desi visitors to grow at fastest rate this decade; double from pre-Covid level in 2029,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-forecasts-desi-visitors-to-grow-at-fastest-rate-this-decade-double-from-pre-covid-level-in-2029/articleshow/119100786.cms,"

NEW DELHI: Uncle Sam expects visitors from India to continue growing at the fastest rate till the end of this decade — as it has seen happen post Covid. The US government's National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) has forecast visitors from India will more than double at 201% from 2019’s 14.7 lakh in 2029, as against an average of 122% for rest of the world with Italy being the second fastest at 131%. Overall, international visitors to America are expected to increase to almost 10 crore in 2029, up from the 2019 figure of 7.9 crore.The US has so far seen visitors from only two countries surpass pre-pandemic levels — India and Italy. “Helped by a strong economy, visitation from India has increased 552% since 2020 to 22 lakh in 2024 and India has become the fourth largest US inbound travel market. This strong growth will continue over the next few years. India visitation is expected to be more than double that of the 2019 level by 2029,” a NTTO document says.Going ahead, the NTTO forecasts India to see the highest growth over 2019 visitors. “For India, one of the fastest growing countries since the pandemic, arrivals to the United States already exceeded the pre-pandemic level by almost 50% in 2024. Although visitation from all Asian countries included in the forecast increased significantly in 2024, China and Japan were still roughly halfway back to their pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, arrivals from South Korea reached three quarters of its 2019 level,” the document says.The NTTO forecast covers the top inbound markets for the US that include Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Italy, UK, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and Brazil. Visitation from these countries accounted for 78% of total US international inbound arrivals in 2024. The US has classified these top markets under three heads: Those which surpassed pre-pandemic levels in 2024 (India and Italy); those that will do so in 2026 (Germany, France, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico) and those that will be fully recovered in 2027 and later (Australia, China, South Korea, UK and Japan).While India-US travel is rouching new highs post Covid, the travel industry says it remains way below potential due to two factors — long visa interview wait times and few direct flights due to US airlines not using Russian airspace. A record number of Indians travelled to the US last calendar year, more than CY 2023’s figure of 17.6 lakh which had overtaken the pre-Covid 2019 high of 14.7 lakh. India is now the second largest overseas source market of international visitors to the US, after the UK.The waiting period for B1/B2 interview is currently 407 days in Chennai; 156 in Delhi; 151 in Mumbai; 140 in Hyderabad and 114 in Kolkata, according to the US state department website.","The US has so far seen visitors from only two countries surpass pre-pandemic levels — India and Italy.

'Shock and awe approach': Raghuram Rajan criticises Trump administration's economic reasoning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/shock-and-awe-approach-raghuram-rajan-criticises-trump-administrations-economic-reasoning/articleshow/119068993.cms,"

Renowned economist Raghuram Rajan challenged the Trump administration ’s economic views, especially on trade deficits and the US dollar’s global influence. He disagreed with economist Stephen Miran’s claims, arguing that America’s trade deficits are due to excessive spending, not foreign demand for US financial assets.Miran, nominated to Trump’s council of economic advisers, suggested that high demand for US Treasuries forces the country to run fiscal deficits, keeping the dollar strong and hurting American exporters.Rajan, however, disagreed, pointing out that the US has had trade deficits since the mid-1970s—long before foreign central banks started holding large dollar reserves after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.He further highlighted that the country does not have an uniform trade deficit, “rather, it has a trade deficit in goods and a net surplus in services (of nearly $300 billion in 2024)”. He pointed out that companies like Apple generate massive profits by designing high-value products while outsourcing manufacturing to countries like China and India.Rajan also questioned Miran’s argument that foreign demand for US Treasuries does not “reflect such a premium, giving the US little benefit from producing high- demand financial assets”, adding, “Why would such demand hold up the dollar but not push down US bond rates?”Instead, Rajan believed that Congress simply spends freely, relying on global investors to fund its deficits. If demand for treasuries were truly excessive, he argued, the US could just “run smaller deficits,” and benefit from even lower borrowing costs.The former RBI governor was also sceptical of Trump’s aggressive stance on global trade.While Miran pointed out, “tariffs will partly be offset by a stronger dollar, as was the case in 2018-19, when the US imposed sweeping tariffs on China,” Rajan warned that such tactics would force foreign central banks to sell US treasuries, making it harder for America to finance its fiscal shortfalls.He acknowledged that global imbalances exist, citing issues like Chinese under-consumption and unfair trade practices by some US partners. However, Rajan also contended that these concerns would be best addressed through negotiations, not economic coercion.Ultimately, Rajan argued that Trump’s policies reflect a broader shift in the US’s attitude towards the global economic system it helped create.While Miran and others portray the dollar’s dominance as a burden, their reluctance to relinquish this ""burden"" suggested otherwise. If Trump’s “shock and awe” approach alienates allies and weakens confidence in the dollar, the former governor warned, the US may one day find itself carrying a real economic burden, one that it made on its own.","Raghuram Rajan challenged the Trump administration ’s economic views, especially on trade deficits and the US dollar’s global influence.

The US economy is facing increasing fears of a slowdown, with stock markets spiralling downward amid growing concerns over President Donald Trump ’s escalating trade war . The Nasdaq Composite has entered correction territory, falling more than 10% from recent highs, while the S&P 500 teeters on the edge of the same level. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also showing signs of a downturn, reflecting heightened uncertainty about the nation’s economic future.The latest data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDP now model paints a grim picture, revising its first-quarter growth forecast from a 2.4% expansion to a 2.8% contraction, spurring fears that a recession could be on the horizon, according to an ET report.While most analysts still view the chances of an immediate recession as moderate, the combination of escalating tariffs, unpredictable fiscal policies, and a hawkish Federal Reserve stance is creating a storm of anxiety across financial markets.A major factor contributing to market volatility is President Trump’s aggressive trade policies. On Tuesday, the US administration imposed a significant increase in tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Canada, raising duties from 25% to 50% in retaliation for Canadian levies on electricity exports to the US Additionally, the administration has enacted a 20% tariff on all Chinese imports, with threats of further duties on goods from Mexico and Europe, deepening concerns among investors.In response to these developments, Wall Street strategists have revised their forecasts. J.P. Morgan’s chief economist has now raised the probability of a US recession to 40%, up from 25% just a month ago. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs has reduced its 2025 US growth forecast from 2.4% to 1.7%, warning that the tariff hikes could shave up to 1% off GDP if other nations retaliate. As businesses scale back on hiring and capital investment, these trade tensions are further dampening economic sentiment.Adding to the uncertainty, President Trump acknowledged the potential for an economic slowdown, stating in a Fox News interview that “there is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big,” but refusing to rule out the possibility of a recession.Hedge fund titan Ray Dalio , founder of Bridgewater Associates, has raised alarm bells over the structural weaknesses in the US economy, particularly the rising national debt. Dalio warned that the country’s ballooning debt burden, now exceeding $36.2 trillion (122% of GDP), could lead to severe economic consequences.“We have a very severe supply-demand problem when it comes to US debt,” Dalio said in a CNBC interview on Wednesday. He noted that the US government would need to sell large amounts of debt, but the world may not have the appetite for it, which could trigger “shocking developments,” including debt restructuring, geopolitical pressure on creditors, or even austerity measures.Dalio’s comments coincide with signals of distress in bond markets, where the yield curve has flattened sharply, often seen as a precursor to an economic downturn. The spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields has widened to its highest level since September 2024, adding to investor concerns about economic instability.The technology sector has borne the brunt of the recent market declines, with the Nasdaq Composite falling nearly 9% in 2025 so far. Wall Street analysts have revised their revenue growth expectations for major tech companies, citing weaker consumer demand, cautious corporate spending, and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding global trade.Indian IT stocks, heavily reliant on US corporate clients, have also suffered. The Nifty IT index has entered bear market territory, with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) seeing a nearly 23% drop in shares, and LTIMindtree losing more than 33% of its market value. Morgan Stanley has downgraded several Indian IT stocks, warning that a potential US recession could significantly reduce demand for outsourced technology services.The Federal Reserve is caught between conflicting pressures. On the one hand, consumer inflation showed signs of easing in February, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising 2.8% annually, slightly below expectations. However, the effects of tariffs on imported goods could drive future price increases, compelling the Fed to keep interest rates elevated for longer.While the Fed has kept rates unchanged in its last two meetings following a 50 basis-point cut in 2024, policymakers have signalled a cautious approach moving forward. Boston Fed President Susan Collins stated that while risks are increasing, it’s still unclear whether a recession is imminent.A prolonged period of high interest rates could place additional strain on an already fragile economic outlook, especially as corporate debt levels continue to climb.Should the US slowdown materialize into a full-blown recession, the global economy could face significant challenges. Emerging markets may experience capital outflows as investors flock to safe-haven assets, while key trading partners such as Europe, China, and India may suffer demand shocks due to declining US imports.For now, investors are closely watching Washington and the Federal Reserve, hoping for clarity on the next steps that could determine whether the US economy simply slows or plunges into a full recession.","The US economy is facing increasing fears of a slowdown, with stock markets spiralling downward.

Greece’s centre-right government celebrated a milestone on Saturday with a credit rating upgrade by Moody’s, the final major ratings agency to lift the junk status on the country’s government bonds, which had been in place for 15 years since the country’s severe debt crisis.“This upgrade marks the closing of a great cycle for the Greek economy and certifies the country’s return to European normality,” said Finance Minister Kostis Hatzidakis, who described the move as “a success not only of the government, but of all Greeks, "" reported news agency AP.Moody’s raised Greece's rating from Ba1 to Baa3 late Friday, citing an improvement in public finances that “have improved more quickly than we had expected” as a key factor behind its decision.The credit rating agency also praised the government’s policy stance, institutional improvements, and the stable political environment, expressing confidence that Greece will “continue to run substantial primary surpluses, which will steadily decrease its high debt burden.”While ratings agencies began restoring Greece’s investment grade status in late 2023, the news of Moody’s upgrade brought a sense of relief to the government, which has faced intense criticism in recent weeks due to strikes and protests over its handling of a deadly rail disaster two years ago.Hatzidakis made these remarks just hours before he handed over the finance portfolio to Cabinet colleague Kyriakos Pierrakakis in a swearing-in ceremony on Saturday, following the government’s announcement of a reshuffle.“Moody’s upgrade of Greece to Baa3 marks the final step in restoring our investment grade by all major rating agencies, highlighting Greece’s significant progress,” said Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in an online post on Saturday. “We remain fully committed to reforms that attract investment, create jobs, and drive sustainable growth,” he added.Greece had spiraled into crisis in 2010, requiring three international bailouts to avoid bankruptcy and repair its public finances. These efforts involved successive and harsh austerity programs imposed by European Union lenders and the International Monetary Fund.National debt as a percentage of GDP peaked in 2020, surpassing 200%, but has steadily fallen since then and is projected to drop below 150% in 2025, according to Greek central bank projections.Moody’s acknowledged the government’s ongoing efforts to reduce debt. “Over a number of years, the Greek public finances have outperformed our baseline expectations, which increases our confidence that Greek debt will remain on a firm downward path,” the agency said, highlighting the improvements in both expenditure restraint and rapidly increasing tax revenues due to enhanced tax compliance and collection measures","Moody's raised Greece's rating from Ba1 to Baa3 late Friday, citing an improvement in public finances that “have improved more quickly than we had expected” Finance Minister Kostis Hatzidakis described the move as “a success not only of the government, but of all Greeks, ""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119040193,imgsize-504278,width-400,resizemode-4/119040193.jpg"

US stocks saw a rally on Friday, though it wasn't enough to stop Wall Street from heading toward its fourth consecutive losing week, marking its longest such streak since August. The S&P 500 surged 1.9% during midday trading, following its 10% drop below its record high—a ""correction"" marking the first since 2023.The index was on track for its best day since the day after President Donald Trump ’s election, when investors were mostly optimistic about tax cuts and other benefits for corporate profits.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 625 points, or 1.5%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 2.4% in midday trading, news agency AP reported.Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management, noted that a multi-day ""relief rally"" could be on the horizon after so much negativity had built up among investors. Ma explained that sentiment swings rarely last in one direction forever, and theUS stock market has been in a swift downturn since hitting a record less than a month ago.One source of uncertainty over Wall Street may be clearing up as the Senate takes steps to avert a potential partialUS government shutdown, which is set to occur by midnight. While past shutdowns have not caused significant disruptions in financial markets, any clarity surrounding such events can ease investor concerns during a time of heightened volatility.Despite this, the largest cloud over the market remains the ongoing trade war initiated by President Trump. Investors are uncertain about the extent to which the administration will allow economic pain through tariffs and other policies in its push for reshapingUS manufacturing and government size. Trump has expressed a desire to bring manufacturing jobs back to theUS and reduce the size of the federal workforce, among other changes.Although the stock market is close to completing its correction, concerns linger about how much of an impact federal spending cuts may have on the economy. Yung-Yu Ma suggested that these worries, along with Trump's unpredictable tariff policies, are likely to persist in the near future.The ongoing uncertainties are already affecting consumer confidence , as evidenced by a preliminary survey from the University of Michigan released on Friday. Consumer sentiment dropped for the third consecutive month, primarily driven by concerns over the future. The job market and the overall economy appear relatively stable at the moment, but the survey found that the high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors makes it difficult for consumers to plan for the future.Expectations for inflation in the long term surged, jumping to 3.9% from last month's 3.5%. This marks the largest increase in the inflation outlook since 1993.On Wall Street, attention is focused on whether these consumer concerns are affecting businesses. Ulta Beauty, for instance, saw a 12.3% increase in stock price after reporting better-than-expected profits for the most recent quarter. However, the company’s forecast for upcoming revenue and profits fell short of analysts’ expectations, prompting the CFO to express caution in light of ongoing consumer uncertainty. Despite this, analysts said the forecast was better than anticipated.Big Tech and artificial intelligence stocks, which had suffered the most in recent sell-offs, also helped to prop up the market. Nvidia, for instance, rose 4.6%, cutting its 2025 loss to 10%, while Apple climbed 1.7%, reducing its loss for the week, which had been on track to be its worst since the 2020 COVID crash.Globally, stock markets were more optimistic, with indexes in Europe and Asia rising. Hong Kong’s index rose 2.1%, while Shanghai’s jumped 1.8%, after China’s National Financial Regulatory Administration issued new guidance aimed at boosting consumer spending. The announcement encouraged financial institutions to support consumer credit and assist struggling borrowers.Economists argue that China needs to encourage more consumer spending to rejuvenate its economy. However, many are calling for broader reforms, such as increases in wages, social welfare, and investment in public health and education.In the bond market, Treasury yields recovered some of their recent sharp losses. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.30% from 4.27% late Thursday, and up from 4.16% at the beginning of last week. Yields have fluctuated significantly since January, when they were near 4.80%. The movement of yields tends to reflect investor sentiment: when concerns about theUS economy grow, yields fall, and when worries about inflation rise, yields climb.","The S&P 500 surged 1.9% during midday trading, following its 10% drop below its record high.

Buffett’s cash strategy

Is Buffett playing it smart?

Is patience pays off in the long run?

Genius move or a costly mistake?



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





When Warren Buffett made the bold move of slashing his Apple shares and hoarding cash, the financial world buzzed. Social media exploded with memes and mixed opinions. Some hailed him as a genius, while others questioned his timing. Fast forward to today, and the market has taken a tumble—and Buffett’s strategy is looking increasingly intriguing.In 2024, Berkshire Hathaway 's cash reserves skyrocketed, nearly doubling to a record-breaking $334 billion. At the same time, the company sold a massive $134 billion in stocks, barely spending a penny on buybacks, according to an ET report. For context, in 2023, Buffett’s firm sold only $24 billion worth of stocks and repurchased $9 billion of its own shares.Despite all the chatter about Berkshire’s giant cash pile, Buffett reassured his shareholders in his annual letter: “The great majority of your money remains in equities.” So why did Buffett make these moves?Buffett’s once-enormous Apple stake, which stood at 906 million shares worth $174 billion, made up nearly half of Berkshire’s stock portfolio. By the end of 2024, Buffett had slashed that position by a staggering 67%, reducing it to 300 million shares worth $75 billion. He also trimmed his holdings in Bank of America by 34%.Since then, Apple and Bank of America have seen their stock prices dip by 15% and 20%, respectively, from their peaks in November. While Apple still posted a 15% increase in 2024, leaving some profits on the table, Bank of America’s price has largely stagnated since June. So, did Buffett foresee trouble, or was he simply making a calculated strategic shift?One thing’s clear: Buffett is playing it safe. US Treasury yields have skyrocketed from under 1% to more than 4% in just three years, making bonds a far more attractive option. Inflation, rising interest rates, and the Federal Reserve’s policies have pushed Buffett to build up Berkshire’s cash reserves, even in the face of potential market volatility.In last year’s Berkshire annual meeting, Buffett stated, “I don’t mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position.” With stock prices running high and bargains few and far between, Buffett’s strategy signals a shift toward patience and caution in a market he believes is overvalued.Hedge fund manager Anurag Singh thinks Buffett's hefty cash reserves are well justified: “Warren Buffett's cash call of $325 billion—about 50% of his portfolio—makes sense,” Singh wrote. “When stocks are priced too optimistically, all the risk falls on investors. Markets will teach you this lesson.”On the other hand, financial author Robert Kiyosaki has been sounding alarms about an impending market crash. Kiyosaki recently warned, “The EVERYTHING BUBBLE is bursting,” and predicted the coming crash could be the biggest in history. With the Nasdaq Composite down 4% in a single day and the S&P 500 down nearly 9% from its record high, concerns are growing that the downturn may deepen.Buffett’s cautious stance now reminds us of his actions during the 2008 financial crisis. Back then, he didn’t sit on the sidelines—he bought aggressively, snagging discounted stakes in Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and other major players when prices hit rock-bottom. If the market continues to slide, it’s likely that Buffett is preparing for another buying spree.As Buffett has always emphasized, long-term thinking is key to successful investing. In his 2017 shareholder letter, he reminded investors, “There is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period.” However, if a major market downturn does occur, Buffett’s advice echoes the wisdom of Rudyard Kipling’s poem If: ""If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs... Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.""So, what’s the verdict? Critics argue that Buffett may have moved too soon, missing out on potential gains as Apple continued to climb. On the other hand, his supporters believe that he’s playing the long game—waiting for the right moment to strike. Buffett has always emphasized the importance of patience and discipline, and this cautious approach could be a sign that he's preparing for a bigger opportunity ahead.One thing is clear: Buffett’s war chest of cash is unparalleled, and if history is any guide, he’ll be ready to capitalize on the next market downturn in a way few others can. When the right opportunity comes along, Buffett won’t be reaching for a thimble—he’ll be grabbing a bucket.As the market remains volatile, the question remains: Was Buffett ahead of the curve, or did he misjudge the timing? Whatever happens, his strategy will be closely watched, as his ability to navigate turbulent markets is unmatched. Time will tell whether his cash hoarding will pay off or if he’s left billions on the table by sitting out the recent stock surge.","Buffett slashed his Apple stake by 67%, reducing it to 300 million shares worth $75 billion.

Asian markets saw gains on Friday, overcoming Wall Street's latest losses. Markets in China rallied after state-run banks and other financial institutions were instructed to take more steps to encourage consumer spending. US futures and oil prices also edged higher.Hong Kong’s benchmark index surged 2.4%, closing at 24,023.73, while Shanghai's Composite index jumped 1.8% to 3,419.56. China’s National Financial Regulatory Administration urged financial institutions to support the development of consumer finance, boost credit card use, aid borrowers facing financial difficulties, and enhance transparency in lending, according to news agency AP.Economists believe China needs to boost consumer spending to revive its economy, though many are calling for deeper reforms, such as improving wages, social welfare, and public sector support in health and education.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 climbed 0.7% to 37,053.10. However, South Korea's Kospi saw a slight dip of 0.3%, finishing at 2,566.36. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.5%, closing at 7,789.70, while Bangkok’s SET index rose 1.2%. Taiwan's Taiex ended nearly unchanged.On the other hand, Wall Street faced further setbacks as President Donald Trump 's escalating trade war contributed to a significant 10% drop in the S&P 500. This decline triggered a “correction” designation, marking the first time since 2023 that the index dropped this much. The S&P 500 slid 1.4% to close at 5,521.52.Stephen Innes from SPI Asset Management commented on the uncertainty facing traders, noting that they were bracing for more policy volatility. The looming risk of a partial US government shutdown, should Congress fail to pass its annual budget, added to the anxiety.Trump’s trade policies continued to cause turbulence, with the president threatening to impose 200% tariffs on Champagne and other European wines unless the EU agrees to reduce tariffs on US whiskey. This comes as part of his ongoing push for reshaping trade relations through tariffs, which has contributed to market volatility.In economic news, US inflation reports were somewhat positive, showing that wholesale prices increased less than expected. A separate report also indicated fewer unemployment benefit applications, signalling stability in the job market.Stocks connected to artificial intelligence (AI) faced additional pressure, with Palantir Technologies dropping 4.8%, Super Micro Computer losing 8%, and Nvidia experiencing fluctuating results, ultimately closing down by 0.1%.On Friday morning, US crude oil rose by 76 cents to $67.31 per barrel, while Brent crude climbed 69 cents to $70.57 per barrel. The US dollar strengthened to 148.80 yen from 147.82 yen, while the euro weakened slightly, falling to $1.0835 from $1.0855.","Hong Kong's benchmark index surged 2.4%, while Shanghai's Composite index jumped 1.8%.

US stock markets saw a decline on Thursday, as President Trump’s ongoing trade war overshadowed encouraging economic news. Despite reports indicating that inflation was slowing and unemployment remained low, market uncertainty persisted due to new tariff threats from the Trump administration.The S&P 500 dropped by 0.9% in midday trading, continuing its recent volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 324 points (0.8%), and the Nasdaq composite saw a 1.3% decrease. The market’s instability has been marked by frequent shifts in performance, with the Dow swinging between slight gains and significant drops, according to news agency AP.President Trump intensified trade tensions by threatening to impose 200% tariffs on European wines, including Champagne, if the EU does not reverse its tariff on US whiskey. This move comes after the EU retaliated against US tariffs on European steel and aluminium. These developments have raised concerns among investors about the potential long-term impact on the economy, particularly regarding inflation and stagnation.Many businesses and households in the US have already expressed concern about the uncertainty caused by Trump’s unpredictable trade policies, with some companies noting changes in consumer behaviour. The growing fear is that this unpredictability could lead to a scenario where the economy stagnates while inflation rises, a situation known as stagflation.On a positive note, two economic reports released on Thursday offered a silver lining. One report showed that wholesale inflation in February was lower than expected, suggesting that price pressures might be easing. Another report indicated that fewer US workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, signalling a strong job market, which is crucial for maintaining consumer spending, the main engine of economic growth.However, Chris Larkin from E-Trade warned that while inflation reports were positive, they might not be able to cut through the noise of the trade conflict. ""The question for markets is whether good news on the inflation front can make itself heard above the noise of the ever-changing tariff story,"" Larkin said.Stocks related to the artificial intelligence (AI) industry also faced pressure. Palantir Technologies, for example, saw a 5.4% drop, while Super Micro Computer lost 5.2%. Nvidia, a major player in the AI field, initially fell but regained some ground, ending the day up 0.4%. These companies, which had experienced significant growth amid the AI boom, are now under scrutiny due to concerns over their high valuations and sustainability.On the upside, Intel saw a significant gain, jumping 14.9% after naming Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO. Tan, an experienced semiconductor executive, will take the helm next week, following the unexpected retirement of Intel’s previous CEO amid challenges at the company.In the bond market, Treasury yields edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.30%, continuing a downward trend since January. This decline reflects shifting expectations for US economic growth as traders adjust their outlook in response to the broader economic uncertainty.","The S&P 500 dropped by 0.9% in midday trading, continuing its recent volatility.

US wholesale inflation flat in February amid looming trade war risks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-wholesale-inflation-flat-in-february-amid-looming-trade-war-risks/articleshow/118987392.cms,"US Wholesale inflation flat in February

US wholesale inflation showed signs of slowing down in February, indicating that price pressures may be easing. However, this trend could be short-lived as President Donald Trump escalates his trade wars with global partners, potentially driving inflation higher.The Labour Department reported Thursday that the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures inflation before it reaches consumers, remained unchanged from January. This followed a 0.6% increase in January. Compared to the previous year, producer prices rose 3.2%, a decrease from the 3.7% annual increase reported in January, news agency AP reported.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, core wholesale prices dropped by 0.1% in February, marking the first decline since July. Core producer prices were up 3.4% from a year earlier, down from a 3.8% increase in January. These results were lower than economists' expectations.This report comes as President Trump intensifies his trade wars, which could disrupt the progress made in controlling inflation. He has implemented 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium and placed a 20% levy on Chinese imports. In the coming weeks, additional tariffs of 25% will be imposed on Canada and Mexico, and Trump is also considering “reciprocal tariffs” that would match taxes imposed by other countries on US products.On Thursday, the president threatened to impose a 200% tariff on European wine, champagne, and spirits if Europe proceeds with tariffs on US whiskey.Many major retailers have warned that higher costs, partly driven by Trump's tariffs, could lead to reduced consumer spending this year.In a separate report on Wednesday, the Labour Department said that consumer inflation slowed for the first time since September. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.8% year-over-year, down from 3% in January. Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, increased by 3.1% from a year ago, the smallest annual rise since April 2021.Wholesale gasoline prices dropped by 4.7% in February, while food prices increased by 1.7%, driven by a sharp 28% rise in the price of eggs.Following three rate cuts in late 2024, the Federal Reserve is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in its upcoming meeting. Analysts Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics noted, “The Fed will not see any argument for pushing interest rates lower or sooner based on today’s figures.” They emphasized that the Fed is now more focused on the potential impact of tariffs on future food prices than on the rise in egg prices reflected in recent PPI numbers.Wholesale prices are an important indicator of future consumer inflation trends, and economists closely monitor them, especially since components like healthcare and financial services feed into the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure—the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. Thomas Ryan of Capital Economics pointed out that some wholesale prices, such as hospital costs and international airfares, were higher than expected in February, which could indicate further inflationary pressures.","Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures inflation before it reaches consumers, remained unchanged from January.

The cultural boycott: Artists and businesses take a stand

The backlash against US policies isn’t just economic—it’s cultural.

In classical music, renowned German violinist Christian Tetzlaff publicly canceled his upcoming US tour, telling the New York Times that Trump’s authoritarian policies made it impossible for him to perform in good conscience.

In Norway, the country’s largest fuel supplier, Haltbakk Bunkers, announced it would no longer supply fuel to US Navy ships. The company’s CEO cited Trump’s treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a White House visit as a key reason.

Even some American allies are re-evaluating their stance. A spokesperson for the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) told DW that while they don’t yet have a formal position on boycotting US goods, they are closely watching how tariffs will impact European consumers.

US President Donald Trump ’s sweeping tariffs—initially targeting Canada, Mexico, and China before expanding to all steel and aluminum imports—are triggering an international consumer backlash. Across Europe and Canada, boycott campaigns against US products are gaining momentum, with businesses and consumers rejecting American goods in response to what they see as unfair trade policies and Trump’s increasingly combative rhetoric toward allies.The movement is being fuelled by a mix of economic retaliation, nationalist sentiment, and frustration with Trump’s foreign policy. The impact is already being felt in industries ranging from liquor and tourism to automobiles and technology.According to an Axios report, searches for “Boycott USA” have skyrocketed globally, particularly in Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden, France, and Canada, per Google Trends data. Facebook groups dedicated to boycotting US-made products have amassed tens of thousands of members, with calls for consumers to buy local or European alternatives instead.In Canada, Trump's tariffs on steel, aluminum, and other goods have been met with a surge of patriotic consumer activism. Many Canadian businesses are urging shoppers to prioritize homegrown products, while provincial governments have taken steps to remove US-made goods from official contracts and retail shelves.In Europe, frustration over Trump’s trade policies has combined with his broader foreign policy decisions, including his comments on Nato and his attempt to acquire Greenland, to fuel resentment toward American brands.The boycott movement has extended beyond economic actions, with cultural figures and businesses alike distancing themselves from the US.The boycott may be impacting Tesla, one of the most recognizable US brands in Europe and Canada. Sales of Tesla vehicles in Europe plummeted 45% year-over-year in January, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).Some analysts suggest this could be linked to CEO Elon Musk’s close relationship with Trump. As a senior adviser to the Trump administration and head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk has been increasingly associated with the president’s policies. This connection could be hurting Tesla’s image among European and Canadian consumers.Trump weighed in on Truth Social this week, dismissing the Tesla boycott as an illegal left-wing conspiracy:While it's too early to quantify the full impact of the “Boycott USA” movement, some American business leaders are already voicing concern.As per the DW article, Takeshi Niinami, CEO of Japanese drinks giant Suntory Holdings, which owns Jim Beam, warned that US brands would suffer internationally due to both tariffs and anti-Trump sentiment.European retailers are making it easier for consumers to avoid American goods. Denmark’s Salling Group, one of the country’s largest retailers, is tagging European products with a black star so customers can identify them more easily.With Trump ramping up nationalist rhetoric ahead of the 2024 election, global resistance to US trade policies could deepen. Some analysts predict that if the boycott continues, American companies may need to rebrand or shift manufacturing to non-US locations to avoid consumer rejection.Meanwhile, Canada and European nations are weighing further economic retaliation. Canadian officials have warned that if Trump escalates tariffs, they will respond with “dollar-for-dollar” countermeasures.At the same time, US tourism officials are scrambling to counteract the drop in Canadian visitors. The US Travel Association (USTA) had forecast a 5% increase in Canadian visitors for 2025, but that now appears unlikely, according to industry experts.What started as a trade dispute has escalated into a full-blown consumer rebellion against US products. The “Boycott USA” movement reflects growing frustration with Trump’s policies and has the potential to impact American brands, tourism, and even global diplomacy for years to come.(With inputs from agencies)","The search for ""Boycott USA"" has spiked on Google in last few days.

Pharma industry pushes back against study linking generics to increased health risks in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/indian-pharma-industry-pushes-back-against-study-linking-generics-to-increased-health-risks-in-us/articleshow/118979754.cms,"Representative Image

A recent study linking Indian-made generic drugs to a higher risk of serious side effects in the United States has sparked a strong backlash from the industry’s most influential lobby group.This comes as India defends its dominant share in the global pharmaceutical market amid rising trade tensions under President Donald Trump's administration.In response to the findings, the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, representing the country's largest drugmakers, issued a statement, disagreeing with the study's premise. They strongly rejected the notion that factors like manufacturing and distribution practices contribute to the quality and efficacy issues in Indian generic drugs, according to a Bloomberg report.""We strongly disagree with the study’s premise that differences in operations and supply chain factors—suppliers, manufacturing and/or distribution practices by different manufacturers—impact the quality and efficacy of Indian generic drugs,"" Bloomberg reported the pharma group statement.The study, which analysed more than 2,400 drugs sold in the US between 2009 and 2018, found that Indian generics were associated with a 54% greater risk of serious adverse events—including hospitalization, disability, and death—compared to domestically made medicines. The researchers attribute these findings to operational and supply chain issues during the manufacturing process as the ""most likely"" cause. The study was published last month in the journal Production and Operations Management.The study adds to growing concerns over the quality of Indian-made medicines, with India being the world’s largest supplier of generic drugs. The country produces around 20% of the global supply and meets approximately 40% of the US demand for non-patented medications.Between 2018 and 2024, US pharmaceutical imports from India are expected to nearly double to $13 billion, highlighting the growing influence of India's pharmaceutical industry. At the same time, President Trump has pushed for companies to bring production back to the US, warning of tariffs of up to 25%, a move that could increase costs for pharmaceutical companies.While regulatory lapses at Indian factories, including unsanitary conditions and poorly trained staff, have raised concerns internationally, the situation was further exacerbated by incidents like the 2022 deaths of dozens of children in Gambia and Uzbekistan due to tainted cough syrup and more recent cases of contaminated eye drops causing blindness in US patients.The authors of the recent study suggested that ""quality corner-cutting"" due to cost pressures may explain the higher adverse event risk. They noted that older drugs were more frequently associated with these events, possibly because manufacturers were under increasing pressure to reduce operational and supply chain costs over time, Bloomberg reported.The Indian pharmaceutical industry has pushed back against the conclusions drawn in the study, citing limitations in the use of adverse event data. They argue that such data often suffers from reporting biases and cannot establish direct causality. The Indian Pharma Alliance further noted that both the industry and regulators have made significant progress in engaging with the US FDA to address manufacturing and quality issues, with FDA inspections playing a key role in quality enforcement.The study authors, however, emphasized the need for stronger FDA oversight , particularly through unannounced inspections. According to their findings, FDA inspections of Indian factories increased by 46% from 2014 to 2024, with instances of objectionable conditions rising by 38% during the same period.They also urged drug manufacturers to focus on improving transparency and quality, suggesting that better manufacturers could potentially leverage superior quality to attract more buyers, while inferior producers could be driven out of the market.“The FDA mandates things, but firms can voluntarily do quite a bit on their own.” The researchers called for the inclusion of quality data on labels and for drugmakers to benchmark themselves against peers, improving the overall standards of the industry.","Study links Indian-made generic drugs to a higher risk of serious side effects in the United States.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

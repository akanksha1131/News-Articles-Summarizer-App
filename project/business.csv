"88% individual taxpayers shift to new tax regime, CBDT chief rules out sunset clause for old regime",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/88-individual-taxpayers-shift-to-new-tax-regime-cbdt-chief-rules-out-sunset-clause-for-old-regime/articleshow/127912537.cms,"The new income tax regime has seen widespread adoption among individual taxpayers, with about 88 per cent now filing returns under the system, CBDT Chairman Ravi Agrawal said, while clarifying that the government is not considering a sunset clause for the old tax regime.He said the choice between tax regimes continues to remain with taxpayers, but added that the shift towards the new regime has been “very good”.“I can tell you that when ITR 1, 2, 3 and 4 are taken together (income tax return forms used by individuals), about 88 per cent of people have moved to the new tax regime"". CBDT chairman told told PTI in a post-Budget interaction.“And insofar as presumptive tax cases, about 97 per cent of the taxpayers have moved to the new tax regime. For corporates, about 60 per cent of the income is now being reflected in the new tax regime,” Agrawal said.The CBDT chief said policy changes announced in the FY27 Budget, particularly related to Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT), could further accelerate migration to the new system.MAT, which applies to companies, is calculated at 15 per cent of book profits when it exceeds normal tax liability. The Budget has proposed treating MAT as final tax and reducing the rate to 14 per cent from 15 per cent for companies continuing under the old regime.On the proposed increase in Securities Transaction Tax (STT), Agrawal said the measure is expected to moderate aggressive derivatives trading activity among retail participants.“Only time would tell how much it would curb, but this is an attempt from the department and the government to actually at least address this issue and flag this issue,” he said.Under Budget 2026-27 proposals, STT on futures contracts will be increased to 0.05 per cent from 0.02 per cent. STT on options premium and options exercise is proposed to be raised to 0.15 per cent from 0.1 per cent and 0.125 per cent, respectively.Agrawal said he remains confident that the revised direct tax collection target of Rs 24.21 lakh crore for FY26 will be achieved.The old tax regime refers to the pre-2020 income tax structure, which allows multiple deductions and exemptions but carries higher tax rates. The new regime offers lower tax rates with fewer exemptions and allows full exemption for individuals earning up to Rs 15 lakh annually","The new income tax regime has seen widespread adoption among individual taxpayers, with about 88 per cent now filing returns under the system.

"If India stops buying Russian oil, what it could mean for Moscow’s revenues — explained",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/if-india-stops-buying-russian-oil-what-it-could-mean-for-russias-revenues-explained/articleshow/127914097.cms,"“India Will Buy Oil From US…” White House After Trade Deal

Sanctions pressure and supply re-routing risks

Short-term flows may fall further

Russia could face a sharp drop in oil revenues if US President Donald Trump succeeds in pushing India to scale back or halt purchases of Russian crude, potentially forcing Moscow to cut prices to attract alternative buyers, analysts and traders told Reuters.The development comes after Trump said a recent US-India trade deal included provisions linked to India halting Russian oil imports, even as Washington increases pressure on Moscow amid ongoing Ukraine peace negotiations.India has not officially halted purchases, citing energy security needs and the importance of access to cheaper crude. However, recent data indicates Indian refiners have adopted a more cautious approach, already affecting Russia’s earnings.According to Reuters calculations, India’s imports of Russian oil fell 22% to 1.38 million barrels per day in December from November — the lowest level since January 2023. Russia’s share in India’s oil imports dropped to 27.4%, while OPEC’s share rose to 53.2%. This follows a peak of nearly 2 million barrels per day in June 2025.“Any further reduction would already be meaningful, because there is only one relevant alternative buyer — China — which has also its limitations in taking in sanctioned crude,” David Wech of Vortexa consultancy told Reuters.Analysts said widening discounts and shrinking buyer pools are already pushing Russian oil prices to record lows, while Moscow’s budget is facing strain due to weaker energy revenues.Russia has faced nearly 30,000 Western sanctions linked to the Ukraine war since 2014 but has managed to redirect oil flows from Europe towards China, India and Turkey. However, Turkey has also reduced purchases in recent months.Russia’s total oil exports stood at 4.91 million barrels per day in December, with China accounting for about 2.3 million barrels per day, according to the International Energy Agency.If India were to sharply cut imports, Russia would likely need to divert supplies to China at deeper discounts or cut production, said Igor Yushkov of Russia’s government-run Financial University.“Output and export cuts would lead to an oil shortage. Hence we are not seeing a full US ban on Russian oil imports — they would suffer themselves from higher oil prices,” Yushkov said.Indian refiners have not received formal instructions to stop buying Russian oil and would require time to wind down existing contracts, sources told Reuters.Imports could decline further in April when Nayara Energy, a Russian-backed refinery with capacity of 400,000 barrels per day, undertakes scheduled maintenance for one month, traders said.Beyond April, trade flows will likely depend on the trajectory of Russia-Ukraine peace talks and India’s broader strategic stance.Trump has suggested India could increase purchases from the US or Venezuela to replace Russian crude. However, US crude differs in quality and cannot directly substitute Russian grades, while Venezuela’s export capacity remains limited, Alexandra Hermann of Oxford Economics told Reuters.Instead, crude from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iraq may emerge as more practical alternatives. However, analysts said steep discounts may continue to make Russian oil attractive for Indian buyers despite geopolitical pressure.","India has not officially halted purchases, citing energy security needs and the importance of access to cheaper crude.

Gold price prediction

today

Gold and

are recovering this week, but are expected to see volatility in the coming days, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. He shares his outlook for gold and silver prices in the coming days:

Gold, Silver Under Pressure After Peaks: Should You Invest And Hold Precious Metals Or Sell Off?

Gold Price Outlook :

Weekly View:

Spot Gold (CMP 4915/Oz): Volatile with an upside test of $ 5020 – 5090/Oz possible in the current week.

Spot Silver (CMP 4915/Oz): Volatile with an upside test of $ 90 - 91/Oz possible in the current week.

Gold was seen recovering along with silver this week, as dip - buyers crowded into precious metals following an abrupt unwinding of a record-breaking rally.Spot gold climbed as much as 10 – 12 % after falling to a low of $ 4404 in the current week extending its slump from Friday that was the steepest in more than a decade. Silver also rose more than 20%, taking it back above $87 an ounce after falling towards $73 in Monday’s trade.Precious metals retreat from record highs seen in last week followed amid a slew of warnings from market watchers that the advances, especially for Silver, had been too large and too swift.The plunge began after CME Group hiked margin requirements on both metals forcing leveraged traders to liquidate positions and accelerating a wave of selling.Month end Rout was also triggered by dollar rebounding from its lows after a report showed that the Trump administration was preparing to nominate Kevin Warsh for Fed chair, a move later confirmed.Traders regard Warsh as the toughest inflation fighter among the finalists, raising expectations of monetary policy that would underpin the dollar and weaken greenback-priced bullion.Ahead of that, the bullion's climb in January had been underpinned by renewed concerns about geopolitical upheaval, currency debasement and threats to the Federal Reserve’s independence.Markets continue to remain sensitive as position adjustments may create selling pressure at higher levels; fundamentals still remain positive for long term perspective.With the nomination of Kevin Warsh as next Fed chair had spooked market sentiments, he is not yet confirmed as Powell’s successor, speculation over his policy stance may continue to influence market sentiment in the short term.China markets have been trading at a notable premium over LBMA indicating strong demand & lack of available silver in local Chinese markets since the start of the year. Recent Chinese gold demand has been notable where last week, China witnessed larger gold ETFs inflows than the US, whose holdings are roughly 7 – 8 times bigger than China holdings.Also wholesale jewellery demand had risen in recent weeks amid Spring Festival restocking, likely amplified by the price dip, as reflected in soaring local gold premiums and stronger trading volumes on the Shanghai Gold Exchange.With China remaining on Lunar New Year holidays in coming weeks starting 17th Feb, exchange volume may remain impacted during the same period.Also with the dollar seen rebounding from its lows since Friday that could keep gold prices on a rollercoaster ride in near term.Investors’ attention could also turn to Friday’s monthly jobs report, though its release could be delayed by a partial government shutdown. Also with Indian rupee witnessing sharp appreciation post announcement of trade deal between India & US could remain a factor limiting upside in local prices.However, the long term outlook for the precious metals could remain positive with dips in gold seen towards 4650 – 4500/Oz could reignite investment demand in the medium term.Given uncertainty around interest rate trajectory, continued central bank demand & ETF flows, diversification of foreign US asset holdings into gold could continue to take place in 2026. These factors could propel Gold to test $ 6000 /Oz in the second half of the current year.","Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers shares his outlook for gold and silver prices in the coming days.

Nifty has been on a roller coaster from the start of this calendar month with India VIX seeing over 80% gain in volatility from January 01, 2026. With large gap up opening unable to sustain, the gap between last week highs and this week’s low is likely to get filled sooner this month. This gap however, should be used to create longs with support seen at the rising 200 DMA for targets of 25940 / 26100.Bank Nifty has already done what we are expecting Nifty to do, which is it has tested its last week’s highs in yesterday’s volatile session. Breaking of current week’s low and reversing near 59700 odd is likely to be used as an opportunity to create fresh longs on the index, as Bank Nifty has experienced 59650 as significant resistance over the past 9 weeks of trade and the same is likely to act as support based on classical technical thesis.After its initial breakout from 15 month sloping trendline, PETRONET had been lacking triggers making it wait within a 6-8% band. With the 200 DMA now supportively reclaimed and stock closing at 6 month highs, momentum buyers could come in. Given the set up an 8-10% rally can unfold.MRPL has recovered over 30% in the last 9 trading sessions given its reversal from the 200 DMA support. A repetitive higher low formation was also seen on weekly charts of the same.Stock is on the verge of closing at 16 month highs on weekly charts if it retains at CMP until Friday’s close which also corresponds to an end to the stock’s 2 year corrective phase.CCL had been consolidating for the past 12 weeks with a negative bias correcting over 15% from its all time highs. With lower high formations seen from the start of this calendar year and a trendline breakout of this consolidation seen this week, prices indicate a start of a fresh up move unfolding back to its previous highs.","Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, the top buy calls for today are: PETRONET, MRPL, and CCL.

US households become increasingly strained in diverging economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-households-become-increasingly-strained-in-diverging-economy/articleshow/127922008.cms,"'Scraping'

No assistance

Around the crack of dawn, a line begins forming at a strip mall in Hyattsville, Maryland, as residents ranging from students to delivery workers and federal contractors wait to sign up for food assistance.""Right now, it's a lot -- paying rent, buying food,"" said Shirleyann Desormeaux, a chef supporting four children in her household.Even with two incomes, ""it's still not enough,"" the 58-year-old added.She said she was keen to work, but has experienced having her hours cut as businesses struggle too.Desormeaux was among 100 or so people turning up in near-freezing temperatures in Hyattsville, a suburb of the US capital Washington, to seek groceries for their families, as anxiety about living costs rises in the world's biggest economy.Although US economic growth has been solid, with President Donald Trump's administration touting Wall Street records and tax relief, analysts warn that a ""K-shaped economy"" has taken hold.This is a situation where wealthier households benefit from rising asset values, but median- and lower-income families increasingly struggle.Nearly 60 percent of consumer spending in the third quarter last year came from the top 20 percent of income earners, according to Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics.In the greater Washington area, some 36 percent of households experienced food insecurity in the past year, according to the Capital Area Food Bank.""We're seeing more individuals in what we would traditionally consider higher-income quartiles,"" said Radha Muthiah, the food bank's CEO.That means a family of four making $90,000 to $120,000 a year could find themselves in need of ""extra assistance in putting food on the table,"" she told AFP.A key reason is ""prolonged, sustained levels of inflation"" after the Covid-19 pandemic, with wage growth not keeping pace, Muthiah said.""People are suffering,"" Desormeaux said.Salih Taylor, a federal worker, said he had not considered visiting a food drive until speaking with his church's pastor.""I used to be like, 'I've got food, I don't need it,'"" the 49-year-old told AFP. But he conceded: ""It helps out a lot.""Food prices in December were 3.1 percent higher than a year ago, although Trump has said there is ""virtually no inflation.""While Taylor makes around $4,200 a month, his salary quickly goes towards his mortgage, utilities and food.Now, he occasionally collects free groceries, including for his mother.""I'm scraping,"" he chuckled dryly, saying his family has cut back on eating out and going on longer drives.Pastor Oliver Carter of No Limits Outreach Ministries, which runs the distribution point in Hyattsville, said he sees rising demand and more immigrants seeking aid since food stamps were slashed for many asylum seekers.""Now, they're left to fend for themselves,"" he said.Federal funding cuts under the Trump administration also meant less support for food drives.""It's really a struggle now to continue doing what we do,"" he said.Beyond the US capital area, a New York Times/Siena poll in January flagged a widespread belief that a middle-class lifestyle is out of reach for most people.For Delaware resident Tricia Jones, who has lived in a hotel room with her husband and toddler for months, this sentiment strikes home.Jones, 46, temporarily lost her income source after spinal surgery last year. Her family was soon unable to afford rent, and she turned to GoFundMe at one point to raise funds.While Jones and her husband are both employed now, she said: ""The pay doesn't keep up with the cost of living.""""We don't get any assistance with childcare,"" she added. ""I couldn't even get assistance with a hotel voucher, because they told me that I work.""Meanwhile, the cost of groceries has climbed. A loaf of bread easily costs $6 and the price of milk has recently risen from $3.79 to $5.79, she said.With a salary of around $1,300, ""there's no way I can pay $1,800 a month for rent on top of all my utilities and childcare,"" she said.""There's no way to stretch it.""","Food bank: 36 percent of Washington area households experienced food insecurity in past year. Food prices in December were 3.1 percent higher than a year ago, although Trump has said there is ""virtually no inflation"" Nearly 60 percent of consumer spending in the third quarter last year came from the top 20 percent of income earners.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127922051,imgsize-27632,width-400,resizemode-4/127922051.jpg"
Crypto awareness outscoring bonds disappoints Sebi chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/crypto-awareness-outscoring-bonds-disappoints-sebi-chief/articleshow/127918405.cms,"SEBI chief Tuhin Kanta Pandey (PTI photo)

MUMBAI: Sebi chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey Wednesday expressed his disappointment at the fact that more Indians know about cryptocurrency than about corporate bonds. “Sebi’s investor survey shows awareness of corporate bonds as an investment product is only about 10%, well below deposits, insurance, and small savings. Even cryptocurrency has higher awareness at 15%,” Pandey said.He was speaking at the inaugural session of a program on the corporate bond market. The survey results published on Jan 20, showed that among Indian households, the awareness about cryptocurrency was at 15%. In comparison, the corresponding numbers for futures & options was 13% while for corporate bonds and Reits & InvITs it was at 10%. The highest awareness among the households surveyed was for fixed and recurring deposits, at 98% while for mutual funds it was at 53% and for stocks & shares at 49%.Pandey stressed on the need for spreading awareness about corporate bonds and spoke about the various benefits that could accrue from the same. “A well-developed corporate bond market gives corporates an alternative to bank borrowing, especially for long-term funding. It diversifies risk beyond the banking system and can help bring down cost of capital for corporates.” Pandey also said that for retail investors, “corporate bonds offer portfolio diversification beyond equities and bank deposits.Access through regulated products and platforms, can help households participate in fixed income securities with clear disclosures and strong investor protection.”The top regulator also spelt out various challenges that the Indian market faces while developing a robust corporate bond market. For one, the current bond market structure is heavily skewed towards highly rated issuers. Also fund raising is highly loaded in favour of financial institutions, rather than a diverse range of industries, which, among others, restricts fair price discovery across sectors. Secondly, the secondary market for corporate bonds is shallow because institutions mostly follow a ‘buy and hold’ approach rather than active trading. And “(retail) participation in corporate bonds remains extremely low- nothing as compared to equity markets.”The Sebi chief said that regulation alone cannot build a robust bond market. So, to understand what keeps the bond market from being as robust as the equity market, he asked the participants to share with the regulator various challenges, what drives their preferences in this market etc.Later, while speaking to reporters, the Sebi chief said that the US-India trade deal could help get more investments into India and help in capital formation.“Fundamentally, when you have an overhang of a regulatory action which is removed, and trade frictions removed, so any capital formation is always accelerated,” Pandey told PTI.","Sebi’s investor survey shows awareness of corporate bonds as an investment product is only about 10%, well below deposits, insurance, and small savings.

A robust economy forms the foundation of a strong foreign policy and India must grow faster and increase its share in global trade to gain respect on the world stage, economist and NITI Aayog 's former vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar has said.Economic strength decides a country's position in global politics. Countries that are weak economically are not taken seriously on the global stage, he insisted.Kumar, currently serving as chairperson of Pahle India Foundation, a not-for-profit policy think tank, was speaking at the Rashtriya Raksha University (RRU) in Gandhinagar on Wednesday.""Economics is the foundation of geopolitics. Our External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has rightly said that the best foreign policy for India is to strengthen its economy. If you don't grow your economy, you don't have the leverage to talk about anything,"" he asserted.Kumar pointed to China, the world's second-largest economy, as an example of how economic growth brings global influence.""Today, China is leading in 47 out of 53 frontier technologies. The Chinese are now leading, not the Americans. That is what gives China the ability to stand up to the US,"" he maintained.Countries that are weak economically are not taken seriously on the global stage, Kumar said.""You may believe and play the games on the table (of diplomacy), but nobody takes you seriously. They will take you seriously only when you are economically strong,"" he told the gathering, which mainly consisted of students.Talking about India's role in the coming years, Kumar affirmed the country must increase its share in the global economy if it wants a bigger voice internationally.India's share in global merchandise trade has remained below 2 per cent for the last three decades, a figure Kumar described as inadequate for meaningful global influence.""In the last 30 years, our share in global merchandise trade has been less than 2 per cent. If you can make it 10 per cent, then we will have a role on the global stage. Just 2 per cent (share) doesn't matter,"" he said, calling it one of India's biggest economic challenges.In the services sector, India's global share stands at around 4 per cent, he maintained, stressing that ambitions for global leadership must be backed by a much stronger economic base.""Let's not attempt to have a big global role unless we make our economy much stronger,"" Kumar said.Speaking on India-US relations amid global policy transitions under the Donald Trump administration, Kumar advised patience and firmness in safeguarding national interests.""This time will also pass. The second thing is to stick to your guns for your national interest. India is not a country that can be taken lightly,"" he opined.He recalled how India weathered international pressure and sanctions following the 1998 nuclear tests conducted under then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.""There was a massive uproar (after the nuclear tests) and sanctions were imposed (on India), but we rode through that,"" he stated, highlighting India's resilience.Kumar emphasised the need for pursuing what he termed ""real strategic autonomy"", urging India not to depend excessively on any single country.""In this context, it is important to review our own relations with China. Time has come to review that relationship,"" he said.To achieve true strategic autonomy, Kumar argued, India must empower its private sector, which he described as the ""engine of economic growth"".""We have to strengthen our private sector and give it all the support it needs, because India can build its economy through the private sector,"" he added.","India must grow faster and increase its share in global trade to gain respect on the world stage, says Rajiv Kumar.

MUMBAI: The rupee slipped 17 paise to close at 90.44 against the dollar on Wednesday, retreating after a sharp 124-paise surge in the previous session that followed news of a trade deal being finalised between India and US.Dealers said the rally lost momentum as the market failed to see follow-through demand, particularly from foreign institutional investors. The absence of large-ticket dollar sales by overseas investors meant the rupee was unable to build on Tuesday’s gains, despite the positive sentiment generated by the trade agreement.The pullback came amid a cautious global backdrop, with risk appetite weakening as global equity markets fell on concerns over AI-led disruption in the technology sector. European stocks slipped from record highs, US futures remained under pressure after a sell-off in software shares, and volatility persisted across asset classes.“If the US-Iran tensions cools off then the weakness of the Rupee is temporary. The short/ medium term range of the Rupee seems to shift towards 89.50 to 90.60/70,” said KN Dey, a forex consultant. He added that there was a possibility of the rupee briefly touching 91.Traders said the rupee’s sharp move on Tuesday had already priced in much of the optimism around the trade deal, leaving little immediate upside without fresh flows. With no major foreign inflows and global risk sentiment turning cautious, the currency gave up part of its gains, ending the session weaker but still well above last week’s levels.In commodity markets, gold extended its rebound, posting its biggest two-day gain in over 17 years, while oil prices stayed elevated after briefly spiking on fresh geopolitical tensions involving the US and Iran.","The rupee slipped 17 paise to close at 90.44 against the dollar on Wednesday. It retreated after a sharp 124-paise surge in the previous session. Dealers said the rally lost momentum as the market failed to see follow-through demand, particularly from foreign institutional investors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127918508,imgsize-23584,width-400,resizemode-4/rupee.jpg"
Trouble brewing in machines for coffee chains?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trouble-brewing-in-machines-for-coffee-chains/articleshow/127918483.cms,"Representative image

Cup of woes

MUMBAI: India’s coffeehouse chains are staring at a troubling brew. A higher customs duty on roasting, brewing and vending machines which is already in place now, will raise costs for companies, hitting their margins.Factor in the rupee depreciation and a wobbly coffee inflation and you have a perfect mix for stirring up a storm in cafe kitchens. “This (changes in duty structure) will inflate our sourcing cost,” said Rajat Agrawal, CEO at Barista Coffee Company, projecting a cost inflation of 3%-4%. For consumers, it could mean a spectre of price hikes although firms do not plan to increase rates on their menus immediately.Companies will now have to pay a 10% customs duty on machines which are largely imported from parts of Europe (primarily Italy, Spain and Romania for roasting and brewing machines) and China (for vending machines), industry executives said. The cost of machines vary depending on the model and the region of sourcing and therefore firms tend to have varied cost structures.Earlier, the rate on machines stood at 7.5% but the govt removed concessions that were being given to certain goods. The benefits lapsed on Feb 2, the budget documents showed. “When customs duty goes up, the taxable value for GST also goes up. As it is, with the depreciation of rupee and fluctuation in prices of coffee, there has been a constant pressure at the input cost level,” said Tarun Jain, CEO at Tim Hortons India.A depreciating rupee pushes up the cost of imported goods. The rupee is currently hovering in the range of about 90 against the US dollar.A competitive market coupled with the fact that the cost of equipment is categorised under capex, companies do not plan to pass on the price rise to consumers immediately. “We will avoid passing the burden to consumers to the extent possible by leveraging on volumes and economies of scale,” said Jain.The roasting, brewing and vending machines are separate and serve different purposes although roasting is required for both brewing and vending. Vending machines are what you see at offices, canteens and other commercial centres and all brands do not operate in the vending space.“This is not something we had expected considering that India does not have manufacturing capabilities in the coffee machine space yet. Our capex costs will go up by 10% and it definitely impacts the cost dynamics of our operations,” said Abhijeet Anand, founder and CEO at abCoffee.Starbucks declined to comment while a message sent to co-founder and CEO of Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters Matt Chitharanjan did not elicit any response. Rising disposable incomes are fueling growth of coffeehouse chains in India.","A higher customs duty on roasting, brewing and vending machines will raise costs for companies, hitting their margins.

MUMBAI: A tech sell-off on Dalal Street on Wednesday—that came on the back of Anthropic’s launch of a new AI-led app that could potentially challenge existing business models of Indian software exporters—wiped off about Rs 1.75 lakh crore worth of market value.The sharp slide in sector leaders like TCS Infosys and Wipro , also left BSE’s IT index down 5.5% at close of session. Despite the tech meltdown, sensex closed marginally higher, up 79 points or 0.1%, as strong buying in other index-heavyweights like Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank more than made up for the loss inflicted by the software exporters.The global tech sell-off had started on Tuesday night that pulled the Nasdaq Composite index down by 1.3%. The bearish sentiment spilled over in other Asian markets on Wednesday, including in India.According to Ravikumar S, CEO, Cognizant , one of the leaders in the software services space, Anthropic’s AI-driven application could penetrate enterprises far more deeply than classical or SaaS software ever did, leading to even more software being created.","The sharp slide in sector leaders like TCS Infosys and Wipro also left BSE’s IT index down 5.5% at close of session.

As cities expand and densify, platforms such as food delivery and quick commerce increasingly function as essential urban infrastructure rather than discretionary services,” he said.Together with GST and income tax cuts the moves will provide a demand-side stimulus, strengthening consumption across income segments.","Budget’s announcement to introduce City Economic Regions, will accelerate urbanisation and formalisation beyond the metros.

Data centres will help create jobs: Nvidia CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/data-centres-will-help-create-jobs-nvidia-ceo/articleshow/127918443.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Days after the moves announced in the Budget, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that data centres will help replicate success of the internet to create jobs in the country.“We have a giant investment in India and we have a lot of partnerships in India. I prefer that India not only welcome data centre companies to India, but also build data centres in India by Indian companies. The actual building of the data centre is maybe 5,000 people, 10,000 people, and there are electricians and plumbers and construction… the upstream as well as the downstream implication of having and then enabling technology infrastructure is incredible. Look at the internet in India. The amount of jobs that it has created upstream as well as downstream. Incredible. Artificial intelligence will do exactly the same thing,” he said.In the Budget, FM Nirmala Sitharaman had proposed to provide a tax holiday till 2047 to any foreign company providing cloud services to customers globally by using data centre services from India. It will, however, need to provide services to Indian customers through an Indian reseller entity.Officials said profits on the income from domestic economic activities will remain taxable as any other domestic company. This will include income data centre services to the global entity by the resident data centre and resale of cloud services to Indian customers by the resident reseller entity.But, in cases where the Indian data centre is a related entity of foreign company (cost plus centre), a safe harbour margin of 15% has been provided to ensure certainty to businesses.“The whole arrangement has been made in a fashion that Indian data centres can offer their services to global entities to make use of them without the global entities having any risk of being entangled with our taxation. That certainty enables them to look at our data centres purely from a commercial financial technology perspective. It is the pure market competitive factor that should determine the decision. Tax should not become a deterrent in that process,” revenue secretary Arvind Shrivastava said at a post-budget conference.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said data centres will help replicate success of the internet to create jobs in the country.

Among most constructive ecosystem

MUMBAI: Warburg Pincus’s global chairman Chip Kaye said India is one of the ‘best constructive ecosystems’ that the PE giant has built over the last 30 years that the US-headquartered private equity major has been in the country.In this period, Warburg Pincus had made 80 investments in India. In terms of scale of investment globally, the country is the second biggest destination behind the US, Kaye said on Wednesday.The firm had partnered companies like HDFC Bharti Airtel and Kotak Mahindra Bank during the formative years of these majors. In addition, it had also invested in companies like Kalyan Jewellers, IDFC First bank, CAMS and a host of other successful corporations.Kaye is in India to celebrate the 30th year of its presence here. “We are proud to have been among the first global private equity firms to invest in India at scale,” Kaye said.The PE major entered Asia in 1994. It came to India two years later, just when the economic reforms under the then finance minister Manmohan Singh had started, and private equity was in its infancy.“It has been a privilege to partner with founders whose vision, talent and resilience have helped shape modern India’s economy.Our early investments in financial services, telecom, and consumer sectors laid a strong foundation for our long-term commitment to India and continue to define how we invest,” Kaye said.For the chief, one of the most significant developments in India in recent times was the growth of the domestic capital. “The greatest positive change (in India) has been the confidence in Indian markets coming from India itself,” he said.At a time when foreign capital flows have become volatile, the confident domestic investors are playing a decisive role in stabilising the market and its outcomes, he explained. According to Vishal Mahadevia, MD & head of Asia private equity, Warburg Pincus, India had been central to the PE major’s Asia growth strategy.",Warburg Pincus’s global chairman Chip Kaye said India is one of the ‘best constructive ecosystems’ that the PE giant has built over the last 30 years.

India to be energy-secure in 20-30 years: Mukesh Ambani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-to-be-energy-secure-in-20-30-years-mukesh-ambani/articleshow/127918393.cms,"Mukesh Ambani (right) and Larry Fink

MUMBAI: Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani on Wednesday said that India will be self-sufficient in the energy sector with reasonable investments in the next 20-30 years. “In the next decade, India will not import 80% of its energy,” he said.“We have a path and God- willing, like with technological breakthroughs, we will be reasonably self-sufficient in energy investments. These are 20-30-year time horizons,” Ambani explained.Ambani was in conversation with Larry Fink, chairman & CEO, BlackRock Inc, one of the world’s largest investment management firms with assets worth more than $11 trillion.Jio BlackRock is the Indian joint venture between RIL and BlackRock. The RIL chief also said that in the next 20-30 years, India’s GDP could leapfrog from the current level of about $4.5 trillion to about $25-30 trillion. “I see (India) outgrowing the world and finding the right place. I am one of those believers who think that this $4-4.5 trillion in a 20-30-year period will outgrow the rest of the world, and we will hit $25-$30 trillion. As we do that, the India opportunity is a 10-20-, 30-year opportunity.”During the conversation, Fink said that the next two decades-and-a-half could be India’s era. “As an investor, our job is to have people focus on the real opportunities to invest over a lifetime. When you think about the growth of India, it’s not a quarter, or a day or a week, or a year. It’s over a long horizon. And you could say maybe this is the era for India and will be so over the next 20-25 years,” Fink said.On a relatively granular level, Ambani feels that in India there are quite a few areas that would need patient capital in the next few decades. Among them are investments in physical infrastructure and technology infrastructure so that every village has intelligence available to them. Each of these are opportunities worth hundreds of billions of dollars, that in turn would offer long-term sustainable compoundable opportunities which would come both from within and outside of the country, he said.Drawing upon his experience in the US, the BlackRock chief said that people who had invested in the growth of the country over the years were far better off than those who kept their money in bank accounts.“If you believe in the era of India, which I believe in, we need to get more people investing alongside the growth of a country. And that’s the role of the capital markets. The focus should be on how we live, how we grow, how we educate ourselves. Those are subsets of the era of India, and the opportunity to be an investor alongside the growth of India.”","Ambani was in conversation with Larry Fink, chairman & CEO, BlackRock Inc.

"Consent to a relationship does not permit filming or online abuse, rules Delhi High Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/legal/news/consent-to-a-relationship-does-not-permit-filming-or-online-abuse-rules-delhi-high-court/articleshow/127902029.cms,"Court ruling (AI image)

How the case arose:

Arguments for bail:

High Court’s Analysis:

“Consent to engage in physical relations does not extend to the misuse or exploitation of a person’s private moments or their depiction in an inappropriate and derogatory manner.”

Rejecting this, the Court observed:

“while on one hand, it has been averred on behalf of the accused in the bail application, and also argued before this Court by the learned counsel, that he was in a friendly and consensual relationship with the victim, but on the other, he wants to blame the complainant of having entered into a relationship with him, allegedly consensual, despite being married — totally forgetting that the friendship was mutual, and not unilateral.

While the accused now wants to categorize and differentiate this friendship as if imposed on him by the complainant after filing of the present complaint and plead innocence, his own pleadings and arguments reflect to the contrary”

The Court held that:

“Even if the first episode of the sexual relationship had been consensual, the subsequent acts were clearly rooted in coercion and blackmail.”

(Vatsal Chandra is a Delhi-based Advocate practicing before the courts of Delhi NCR.)

The Delhi High Court has refused to grant bail to a person accused of sexually exploiting a woman by threatening to circulate intimate videos, holding that consent to have a relationship or even a sexual relationship cannot be extended to support coercion, filming of intimate scenes, or their misuse through social media.Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma passed the order on 17.01.2025 and dismissed a regular bail application filed by the accused in a case registered under Sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.The complainant, who was a married woman residing in Delhi with her children, while her husband worked in Gujarat, came into contact with the accused due to family ties. The accused worked overseas and was claimed to have become very close to the complainant because of continuous communication. During this, the accused transferred around Rs.3.5 lakh to the complainant to help her pursue a professional course, with the understanding she would pay it back upon securing employment.The relationship soon took a darker turn. The complainant claimed that the accused then used this relationship to manipulate her into submission to his sexual requests. She argued that he coerced her into stripping off during WhatsApp video calls which was recorded without her knowledge.When the accused came to Delhi towards the end of 2023, he presented her with these videos and forcibly established physical relations with her for two days under the threat of making her videos public. He also made a video of the complainant in which she was forced to admit having obtained Rs.5 lakh from the accused.Later, the accused started defaming her by sending the said videos to the people in her native village and posted her inappropriate video on social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram.On 17.01.2024, an FIR was registered against the accused at Police Station Neb Sarai, Delhi. The complainant was medically examined at AIIMS, Delhi, her statement under Section 164 of CrPC was recorded and the accused was arrested on 20.01.2024.The accused argued before the High Court that the relationship between the parties was consensual and had gone sour after a disagreement on the financial issue. He also claimed that the relationship was consensual and that the money given to the complainant was a loan and relied on a loan agreement between the parties. It was also argued that the accused had been in custody for nearly a year, the forensic report was still awaited, and the trial would take time.The accused further argued that the complainant was in a consensual relationship with him despite being married and having children. He also mentioned that the complainant was working in a massage parlour, implying that her profession weakened her allegations.The State fought against the bail request based on the statement of the complainant made under the provision of Section 164 of the CrPC, stating that, the accused used intimate videos as instruments of blackmail and control. The counsel representing the complainant pointed out the fact that although the accused had not only prepared such material but also it was published, which, according to the prosecution, aggravated the offence.The amicus curiae appearing for the complainant argued that the accused had betrayed the complainant’s trust, created explicit content without consent, and then weaponized it to sexually exploit her. It was further alleged that the accused had uploaded morphed images of the complainant’s minor daughter on social media.In determining the bail application, the High Court looked at whether the sexual assault charges could be watered down at this point by the claim of having a consensual relationship by the accused. The Court observed that though the complainant may have agreed to a relationship in the past, such agreement cannot be regarded as license to all future actions. The Court rejected the argument that an consensual relationship could automatically neutralize allegations of sexual assault.The Court observed that even if the first sexual encounter was consensual, such consent does not extend to recording intimate moments or using them as tools of coercion.The Court made a categorical observation against the defence argument by rejecting it:The Court also expressed the opinion that, after one uses intimate material to intimidate or control an individual, then no other sexual act can be considered consensual. It held that according to the allegations, the complainant was subjected to the fear of humiliation and reputational damage at all times, which is enough to vitiate any assertion of free consent.The High Court further frowned upon the effort to use the marital status or the profession of the complainant to weaken the charges. It noted that such arguments were ill placed and legally invalid. The Court observed that the friendship between the two parties was two sided and that the accused could not subsequently claim to have been forced into the relationship. In that regard, the Court noted that putting the blame of the inquiry on the complainant by highlighting on her marital status was ‘unacceptable’.One of the major considerations that the Court has paid attention to was the fact that the accused had morphed and shared the photographs of the minor daughter of the complainant on the social media claiming that the latter was engaged in sex trade.According to the Court, these accusations coupled with the confiscation of digital material contributed to the seriousness of the crime and could not be ignored at the bail stage.After considering the material on record, the High Court concluded that the accused’s conduct, as alleged, went far beyond a dispute arising out of a failed friendship or financial transaction.Considering the seriousness of the charges, the character of digital evidence, and that material witnesses were yet to be examined, the Court found that the case was not a fit case to grant bail.While dismissing the bail plea, the Court also expressed concern over delay in forensic examination. It directed the Forensic Science Laboratory to expedite preparation of the pending report, noting that the accused was in judicial custody and that the trial should not be delayed on that account.The Court clarified that all observations were confined to the bail stage and would not affect the merits of the trial.",The Delhi High Court has refused to grant bail to a person accused of sexually exploiting a woman by threatening to circulate intimate videos.

India-US Trade Deal: Ex-US Trade Rep Mark Linscott Hails Pact Linking World’s Top Economies

The ambition Is Set (February 13, 2025)

Negotiations begin — then stall (March–April 2025)

Formal talks progress (April–June 2025)

Deadline pressure (June 2025)

Tariff escalation (July–August 2025)

Backchannel push to salvage talks (September–December 2025)

The Deal is sealed (February 2026)

US President Donald Trump on Monday announced a trade deal with India, months after Washington imposed steep tariffs of up to 50 per cent on Indian goods, including penalties linked to New Delhi’s purchase of Russian crude.Announcing the agreement on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said the US would cut reciprocal tariffs on Indian exports to 18 per cent from 25 per cent and claimed that India had agreed to lower tariffs on US goods and halt Russian oil imports. Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledged the tariff reduction, calling it a boost for “Made in India” products, but New Delhi has not commented on the oil-related claims made by the US president.The deal was announced after months of negotiations. Here's a look at the key moments that led to deal announcement on February 2Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump agreed to deepen bilateral trade ties, setting a target of more than doubling trade to $500 billion by 2030. The two sides announced plans to negotiate the first tranche of a multi-sector Bilateral Trade Agreement by fall 2025.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal made multiple visits to Washington, engaging with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. But on April 2, Trump imposed a 26 per cent import duty on Indian goods, jolting talks. Though the tariff was suspended for 90 days on April 9, uncertainty lingered.India’s chief negotiator Rajesh Agrawal led delegations to Washington, while a US team headed by Additional USTR Brendan Lynch visited India. Negotiators agreed on the framework of talks spanning 19 chapters, including tariffs, market access, digital trade, and regulatory barriers.With the July 9 tariff deadline approaching, India sent another delegation to Washington to bridge differences. Days later, Trump publicly said the US was headed towards a “very big” trade deal with India, signalling political intent even as differences remained.On July 31, the US announced a 25 per cent duty on Indian goods, followed days later by an additional 25 per cent penalty tariff linked to India’s continued purchase of Russian oil. Tariffs on most Indian exports rose to 50 per cent, sharply raising the stakes.After months of escalation, negotiators returned to the table. USTR officials visited India in September, followed by high-level engagements in New York and Washington. By December, six formal rounds of talks had been completed, with Deputy USTR Rick Switzer leading a delegation to New Delhi.In January, both sides signalled momentum, with Goyal saying India was working to close the “father of all deals.” On February 2, Trump announced that Washington would reduce the reciprocal tariff on Indian goods to 18 per cent following a phone call with Modi, sealing the agreement.","US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with India on Monday.

NEW DELHI: US -listed shares of major Indian companies surged after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal cutting US tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, in return for India agreeing to halt purchases of Russian oil and lower trade barriers.On Wall Street, IT services major Infosys closed 4.3% higher, Wipro jumped 6.8%, HDFC Bank gained 4.4%, and the iShares MSCI India exchange-traded fund rose 3%, reflecting investor optimism around improved trade access and reduced tariff pressure.Trump announced the agreement on Monday following a call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying India would now buy oil from the United States and potentially Venezuela. A White House official told Reuters that the US would rescind a punitive 25% duty imposed on all imports from India over its purchases of Russian oil, which had been stacked on top of a 25% “reciprocal” tariff.PM Modi welcomed the move, saying, “Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%. Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement.”Trump said India had committed to “BUY AMERICAN at a much higher level,” including more than $500 billion worth of US energy, technology, agricultural and other products. “They will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO,” Trump said.Despite the market reaction, details of the deal remain limited. Trump’s social media post did not specify when the lower tariff rates would take effect, the timeline for India to end Russian oil purchases, or the scope of trade barrier reductions. As of late Monday, the White House had not issued a presidential proclamation or Federal Register notice required to formalise the changes.India’s commerce and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Russia’s embassy in Washington also did not respond. Previous US trade deals with Japan and South Korea included large investment commitments, but no such pledges were mentioned in the India announcement.Economists said the agreement brings India broadly in line with Asian peers on tariff rates. Madhavi Arora of Emkay Global said it would remove a disproportionate drag on India’s exports and its rupee, after Indian markets were hit hard by the tariff hikes and saw record foreign investor outflows in 2025.US business groups reacted cautiously. The US Chamber of Commerce called the announcement progress toward a broader market-opening deal. “We are optimistic that this is the first step toward a comprehensive trade agreement that will unlock even more private sector collaboration,” its CEO Suzanne Clark said.The deal also comes amid efforts by the Trump administration to finalise trade frameworks before a US Supreme Court ruling on the legality of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs. India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, has recently begun reducing Russian oil purchases, with imports projected to fall sharply in the coming months, according to Reuters.","US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal cutting US tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%.

US plans $12 billion stockpile to cut China dependence; rare earth security becomes strategic priority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-plans-12-billion-stockpile-to-cut-china-dependence-rare-earth-security-becomes-strategic-priority/articleshow/127865741.cms,"The United States is preparing to launch a $12 billion critical minerals stockpile initiative aimed at reducing dependence on China for rare earths and other strategic resources, according to a White House official, as Washington intensifies efforts to secure supply chains for key industries, AFP reported.The project is expected to combine about $1.7 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), with funding directed towards securing and storing critical minerals for use by US industries including automotive, technology and defence sectors.The stockpile is designed to support private-sector demand by ensuring access to minerals vital for manufacturing products ranging from smartphones and electric vehicles to advanced military equipment.Rare-earth metals have gained strategic importance after China, a dominant global supplier, imposed export restrictions last year, heightening supply chain concerns across Western economies.China’s dominance across the rare earth value chain — spanning mining, processing and advanced materials innovation — is the result of sustained industrial policy over several decades, giving Beijing leverage in global trade negotiations.The proposed stockpile, expected to be announced by President Donald Trump, aims to gradually offset this advantage and stabilise access to critical materials for US manufacturers.According to reports, the initiative — dubbed “Project Vault” — could involve participation from more than a dozen companies, including automakers General Motors and Stellantis, aerospace major Boeing and technology firm Alphabet-owned Google.The programme is expected to cover rare earths, critical minerals and other strategic elements prone to supply disruptions and price volatility.The move comes amid renewed trade tensions between the United States and China following the reintroduction of tariffs after Trump returned to the presidency last year.The US and its allies are increasingly investing in alternative mining and processing supply chains to reduce strategic dependence on China, though industry experts caution that building fully diversified supply networks could take several years.The EXIM Bank is expected to vote on authorising the proposed 15-year loan for the project, which could become one of the largest financing deals of its kind, according to reports.","The project is expected to combine about $1.7 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of the United States.

Wall Street opened on a subdued note Monday as big technology stocks weighed on US indices, even as gold and silver prices clawed back part of their recent losses, according to AP.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, putting it on track for a fourth straight modest decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 173 points, while the Nasdaq Composite also dropped 0.2% in early trade. Nvidia and other large technology stocks pressured the market, as their chips remain central to global artificial intelligence expansion.The moves followed global volatility overnight. US futures had earlier weakened, with S&P 500 futures down 0.7%, Dow futures off 0.4%, and Nasdaq futures falling 0.7%, amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s nominee for the next Federal Reserve chair and renewed concerns about a potential AI market bubble.Precious metals recovered part of last week’s sharp losses. Gold rose 1.3% to about $4,800 per ounce, while silver jumped 5.9% to $83.19, though both remained below recent highs after Friday’s sharp correction.Bitcoin stabilised after a steep fall, rising about 1.5% to just above $78,000, though crypto-linked stocks remained under pressure. Coinbase fell 3.7% in early trade, while bitcoin holder Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, dropped 7.6%.Oil prices were sharply lower after tumbling more than 5% overnight.

Natural gas prices dropped 17% after recent weather-driven gains.Investors are also tracking a heavy week of corporate earnings and US labour market data, including the January jobs report due later in the week.Shares of Walt Disney Co edged up less than 1% after the company reported strong first-quarter results, supported by box-office performances of “Zootopia 2” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” Disney Entertainment revenue rose 7%, while Experiences division revenue grew 6%.Markets are also assessing the potential policy stance of Kevin Warsh, Trump’s nominee for Federal Reserve chair, whose nomination requires Senate approval. Concerns that the Fed’s independence could be tested have helped support gold prices and weaken the US dollar over the past year.In global markets, Asian indices saw sharper declines earlier in the session.

US President Donald Trump has claimed that his sweeping tariff policies have created an “American economic miracle”, dismissing warnings of global fallout and asserting that critics of his trade strategy “were all wrong”.In an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal, Trump said the tariffs he imposed on nearly all foreign countries last April had strengthened the US economy rather than triggering the global economic meltdown predicted by skeptics.“When I imposed historic tariffs on nearly all foreign countries last April, the critics said my policies would cause a global economic meltdown,” Trump wrote, as quoted news agency ANI. “Instead, they have created an American economic miracle, and we are quickly building the greatest economy in the history of the world, with other countries doing just fine!”The US president said he inherited a “ravaged economy” from his predecessor and was accused of pushing the world towards recession, but claimed those forecasts had been disproved. “Nine months later, the results are in, every one of those predictions has proven completely and totally wrong,” he wrote, adding that since his election in 2024 the US had seen 52 stock market highs.Trump asserted that the American economy was growing at 4.4 per cent with inflation at 1.4 per cent, and that real incomes for US workers had risen by between $1,000 and $2,000. He also claimed the stock market had “skyrocketed” since what he described as “Liberation Day”, saying the Dow Jones Industrial Average could soon breach the 50,000 mark.In the op-ed, Trump further claimed his administration had cut the federal budget deficit by 27 per cent in a single year and slashed the monthly trade deficit by 77 per cent, “all with virtually no inflation”.He also cited trade agreements with China, the UK, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, saying these deals had blunted retaliation against the US and strengthened economic security.Trump went on to make broader claims about the geopolitical impact of tariffs, arguing that they had bolstered US national security and even contributed to peace-making efforts. He asserted—without evidence—that tariffs had helped resolve several conflicts, including what he described as mediation between India and Pakistan.Concluding his article, Trump urged critics to acknowledge his record. “Just over one year ago, we were a ‘DEAD’ country. Now, we are the ‘HOTTEST’ country anywhere in the world,” he wrote, adding that skeptics should don his “favourite red hats” bearing the slogan: “TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING!",US President Donald Trump has claimed that his sweeping tariff policies have created an “American economic miracle” He dismissed warnings of global fallout and asserted that critics of his trade strategy “were all wrong” Trump said the tariffs he imposed on nearly all foreign countries last April had strengthened the US economy rather than triggering global economic meltdown.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127824776,imgsize-747985,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
US government enters partial shutdown after Congress fails to pass 2026 budget,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-government-enters-partial-shutdown-after-congress-fails-to-pass-2026-budget/articleshow/127814414.cms,"Schumer DARES Trump On ICE After Rare Deal Stripping DHS Funding To Halt Shutdown: ‘No Vote Unless…’

The US government entered a partial shutdown Saturday after Congress failed to approve the 2026 budget by midnight. The shutdown was triggered by Democratic opposition to federal immigration agents killing two protesters in Minneapolis, which halted talks about Department of Homeland Security funding. However, the disruption is expected to be brief as the House plans to approve a Senate-backed deal early next week.The Senate also passed a funding package Friday that covers many federal agencies through September. It also includes a temporary two-week extension for DHS operations while lawmakers work out immigration enforcement details. However, about 75% of federal operations are impacted by the shutdown, affecting various sectors like education, health, housing, and defense.Senate Democratic Minority Whip Dick Durbin criticised the administration's priorities, saying, ""Instead of going after drug smugglers, child predators, and human traffickers, the Trump Administration is wasting valuable resources targeting peaceful protestors in Chicago and Minneapolis."" He added, ""This Administration continues to make Americans less safe.""Federal departments started implementing shutdown procedures overnight.If the shutdown continues beyond a few days, many federal workers could face unpaid leave or work without pay until funding resumes. However, both Republican and Democratic leaders believe the disruption will be short-lived once the House approves the Senate's package.President Trump has endorsed the Senate's agreement and is pushing for quick House action. He aims to avoid a lengthy shutdown like the record-breaking hit last fall that disrupted federal services for over a month. The House, currently out of session until Monday, is expected to vote on the package when they return.While federal agencies began shutdown preparations, the impact on government services, contractors, and federal workers should be minimal if the House passes the funding package as anticipated early next week. This would restore funding within days, limiting the shutdown's practical effects.","The US government entered a partial shutdown Saturday after Congress failed to approve the 2026 budget by midnight.

Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

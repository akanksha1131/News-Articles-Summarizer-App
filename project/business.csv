Biggest stock market crash coming? The author of ""Rich Dad Poor Dad,"" Robert Kiyosaki, has made a striking prediction about the stock market's future. In a post on X (formerly Twitter) he shared that February 2025 will witness what he terms the ""biggest stock market crash in history.""Kiyosaki views this predicted market downturn not merely as a crisis, but as a significant opportunity for alert investors who are prepared to take action.His 2013 publication, ""Rich Dad's Prophecy,"" previously cautioned about an unprecedented market collapse that would surpass earlier financial crises. His recent social media post suggests this prediction is approaching realisation, with the anticipated crash set for February 2025.According to an ET report, Kiyosaki maintains an optimistic outlook, noting that market crashes create buying opportunities. He points out that various assets, including properties and vehicles, become more accessible during such economic downturns.Kiyosaki suggests that the movement of capital from traditional markets towards alternative investments, particularly Bitcoin, presents promising prospects. He anticipates substantial growth in cryptocurrency values, expressing this through his ""boom, boom, boom"" description. As a long-standing supporter of Bitcoin, gold, and silver, he advocates transitioning ""out of fake and into crypto.""His support for Bitcoin as a reliable investment option coincides with the cryptocurrency's increasing acceptance among various investor groups. He considers Bitcoin particularly valuable during periods of market uncertainty, especially when conventional investments become less attractive.Kiyosaki emphasises that even minimal Bitcoin holdings, as small as one Satoshi, could potentially generate substantial returns while other investments depreciate during the crash.His February 2025 market crash prediction aligns with his established perspective on financial market cycles. His reputation for unconventional financial viewpoints and criticism of traditional banking systems is well-documented, often encouraging alternative investment approaches.","Robert Kiyosaki, author of ""Rich Dad Poor Dad,"" has made a striking prediction about the stock market's future.

US investor to seek banker as Sebi 'returns' its Religare offer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-investor-to-seek-banker-as-sebi-returns-its-religare-offer/articleshow/117663733.cms,"File photo

MUMBAI: Florida-based investor Digvijay Laxmansinh Gaekwad , who has shown interest in purchasing Religare Enterprises , will need to appoint a merchant banker to comply with Sebi 's takeover rules. After that, he will seek the regulator's approval to make an offer for the New Delhi-based financial services company.This comes after Sebi on Tuesday ""returned"" Gaekwad's letter requesting permission to submit a competing offer to acquire 55% of Religare. In a stock exchange disclosure, Religare shared Sebi's letter that said Gaekwad's letter is being returned ""since the same is not an exemption application in terms of regulation 11"" of the takeover code. Regulation 11 empowers Sebi to grant exemptions to an acquirer from strict compliance with certain provisions of the open offer process.The Burmans of Dabur are the largest shareholders of Religare, holding a 25% stake, and they have made an open offer to acquire an additional 26% stake from the company's public shareholders. The Burmans' offer, which opened on Jan 27, will close on Feb 7.Sources have indicated that Gaekwad will need to open an escrow account and deposit a percentage of the total size of the open offer before issuing a detailed public statement. Approval from RBI is required for a foreign investor to open an escrow account.Gaekwad has offered Rs 275 for a share of Religare, which is a 17% premium to Burmans' offer of Rs 235 apiece. On Tuesday, the Religare stock ended at Rs 243 on the BSE. Gaekwad, who was born in India and moved to the US in 1987, has varied interests spanning cloud services, real estate, and hotels. Religare is Gaekwad's first attempt to bid for an Indian financial services company.Sebi rules mandate the appointment of a merchant banker to manage the open offer process.However, Sebi's response indicates that Gaekwad's letter did not meet the application criteria outlined under its takeover rules. Last week, Religare disclosed that a minority shareholder had approached the Delhi high court, seeking to stop Burmans' open offer. The shareholder owns 500 shares of Religare. The court then issued a notice to Burmans and Sebi stating that the open offer ""shall be subject to the outcome"" of the lawsuit.","Florida-based investor Digvijay Laxmansinh Gaekwad has shown interest in purchasing Religare Enterprises.

""The other half is either PHEVs or range extenders - so some sort of a combination of battery and combustion engine,"" Jahn told TOI. ""So, the question is what's really the best for India?""Jahn said against some highly optimistic forecasts, the share of electrics will actually take time to rise in India (EVs were 2.4% of total passenger vehicles volumes of 4.3 million in 2024), unlike the growth seen in China. ""The road to electrics will be slower in India than expected. So, it's a very complex issue and we will follow whatever policy will come... The transition will be not very fast given the (charging) infrastructure in India, given the sentiment of the customers, and also the range anxiety issues that still persist.""Asked about the group's plans for investing under India's new EV policy, which mandates a minimum manufacturing investment of $500 million to enjoy highly-subsidised import duty of 15% for 8,000 vehicles annually, he said it is being considered. ""I think it's very interesting for us and we are now basing our plans on this policy. But, there are more policies to be finalised in the first half of this year that will also have an impact on which car we bring, how fast we get it, or whether we get it as an import or local production.""The company remains optimistic on the performance here, especially after it launched a mainstream sub-4 meter SUV Kylaq. ""We hope to more than double our sales in India this year and cross 1 lakh units in annual sales against 36,000 units in 2024.""The company will launch more cars here, which is likely to include electric Enyaq. ""We will also bring the Superb (luxury sedan) this year, as well as the new Kodiaq (SUV).

Eyes on Budget for rupee support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/eyes-on-budget-for-rupee-support/articleshow/117662723.cms,"MUMBAI: After RBI's liquidity infusion into the banking system, debt fund managers and economists expect govt to propose measures that would give a boost to the rupee.Although over the last several months even as the dollar appreciated against most currencies, the rupee was mostly resilient when compared with other competing currencies of countries like Brazil, Korea, and Turkey. It's only recently that the rupee broke below the 86-to-a-dollar mark and had slid closer to the 87-mark. Lately it has strengthened and on Tuesday closed at 86.52 to the dollar.Such steps could include some proposals to promote exports that would be a sentiment-booster for the rupee in the short run and bring in positive results in the long run. Budget proposals could also propose new measures to attract foreign deposits with banks and relax the interest rate cap that banks are allowed to pay on such deposits, they said. However, any massive NRI deposit mobilisation move, like the one in 2013, is almost surely ruled out, an economist with a bank said.According to a debt fund manager, India's currency management never aimed at targeting particular levels of currency, instead emphasis had been on an orderly movement of the currency. In that approach, monetary policy used to be an important tool, to ensure an appropriate interest rate differential to support the rupee, beside intervention in the currency market to support the currency.Of late, however, it has been observed that RBI refrained from intervention in the currency market to avoid liquidity tightness in the money market considering domestic growth inflation dynamics. In addition to that, the central bank is also injecting rupee liquidity to ensure smooth transmission of monetary easing going forward. It is a clear departure from earlier currency management approaches.""Banking system liquidity can be treated as an indicator of currency supply. So, the current trend of absence of dollar sell combined with injection of rupee liquidity through OMO purchase by RBI, is going to augment currency supply instead of reducing it. Hence it can be inferred that currency management through other approaches for augmenting flow are being considered instead of managing it through liquidity and interest rate tools,"" the fund manager said.",The rupee broke below the 86-to-a-dollar mark and had slid closer to the 87-mark. Lately it has strengthened and on Tuesday closed at 86.52 to the dollar.

""It will take time, the entire ecosystem needs to band together to get our fundamentals right by bettering ease of business, improving higher education, and increasing R&D spends on deeptech,"" he says.Shah adds that Indian entrepreneurs, business houses, and venture capitalists must invest time and money into hundreds of new ideas for the country to have a standing in AI. ""Frugality cannot be an excuse to miss out on being the best in the world,"" he says.Arun Chandrasekaran, distinguished VP analyst on AI at Gartner, says India needs to invest more in core research to build some capable models in the global AI race.

At one point, the sensex was up nearly 1,200 points but the late sell-off, mostly by foreign funds, pulled the index down from its intra-day high.On the NSE, the nifty too saw strong rally in early and mid sessions and a late sell-off, and eventually settled at 22,957 points, up 128 points (0.6%) on the day. HDFC Bank ICICI Bank and Axis Bank added the most to the sensex's rally on Tuesday. And BSE's banking index, bankex, closed 1.5% up.The feel-good effect of the RBI's decisions on Dalal Street investors were strong enough to even discount the overnight sell-off in the US markets that was led mainly by a host of tech stocks. After DeepSeek, a low-cost AI model by a Chinese start-up shook the tech world during the weekend, Nvidia, the leading AI-chip manufacturer, lost about $600 billion worth of market value in Monday's session. On Tuesday, however, as the dust settled, the stock was up about 2% in early trades.The Tuesday's gains in the two leading indices in the domestic market came despite foreign funds remaining aggressive sellers with the net outflow at Rs 4,921 crore, BSE data showed. So far this month, foreign portfolio investors have net sold stocks worth about Rs 76,500 crore, data from NSDL and BSE showed.Despite a reversal in the two leading indices, the selloff in the midcap and the smallcap spaces continued.

As a result, BSE's market capitalisation was down by about Rs 70,000 crore to Rs 409 lakh crore.According to Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, on Monday, large-cap stocks outperformed, as their valuations have now reached fair levels and are further supported by expectations that the market correction is nearing its bottom. ""In contrast, mid- and small-cap stocks continued to decline, as they remain overvalued.

While many have welcomed the move as a step towards ""equality"", some from the community have expressed concerns, fearing it may be used as a tool to marginalise them.Halala, a controversial practice among a small section of the minority population, requires a divorced woman to marry and consummate a marriage with another man before remarrying her former husband. Iddat is a waiting period that a woman must observe after divorce or the death of a husband before remarrying. The duration may vary as the length of Iddat depends on circumstances and the woman must ""follow a simple lifestyle during the time period"".Social activist Shahnawaz Siddique highlighted the progressive aspects of the UCC, such as mandatory marriage registration and property rights for women. He added: ""While Muslim women already have inheritance rights under Sharia law, social reforms should largely focus on education. UCC should not become a tool to target us.""Welcoming the govt's decision, Siddique pointed out that ""Halala was already forbidden in Islam according to the hadith of the prophet and may be still practiced by a small minority of Muslims, mainly in places that recognise triple talaq.""However, religious leaders voiced strong opposition. Maulana Arif, state president of Jamiat Ulema (Uttarakhand), told TOI: ""This is a clear violation of our constitutional rights. The Constitution allows us to follow our faith and its laws.

Three years ago, Liang Wenfeng 's quantitative hedge fund firm apologised profusely to investors for losing money during a tumultuous period for China's stock market.It was a surprising stumble for Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management , which used artificial intelligence to pick stocks and had grown rapidly to become one of the country's largest quant funds. As the firm navigated through that crisis and its assets shrunk by more than a third from a peak of more than $12 billion, behind the scenes Liang was laying the groundwork for a new AI startup, DeepSeek .DeepSeek, which grew out of High-Flyer, is now threatening to upend the global AI supply chain and challenge the seemingly-unassailable US lead in critical frontier AI technologies. The sudden popularity of the 20-month-old firm's breakthrough technology and its namesake app sparked a massive US and European stock rout on Monday, wiping out close to $1 trillion in combined market value from chip giant Nvidia and other peers.It has also drawn shock and awe over how Liang, an engineering graduate who has never studied or worked outside of mainland China, pulled off such a feat. He has demonstrated that with local artificial intelligence engineers, constrained access to the latest semiconductor technologies and limited resources, it is possible to match - and even surpass - the best in the field.The question now gripping investors, companies and policymakers is whether artificial intelligence requires hundreds of billions of dollars in capital expenditure to come up with the latest innovations and vanguard AI models - and whether export controls can hold off Chinese competition.Liang has been compared to OpenAI founder Sam Altman, but the Chinese citizen keeps a much lower profile and seldom speaks publicly. ""OpenAI is not a god and cannot always be at the forefront,"" Liang told Chinese media outlet 36Kr in July 2024.The previous year, Liang said more investment doesn't necessarily lead to more innovation. He has also opined on how Chinese companies have long been mostly followers as opposed to technology innovators. The problem has been a ""lack of confidence and not knowing how to organize high-density talents to achieve effective innovation,"" he was quoted as saying.Liang was born in 1985 in Zhanjiang, an economically poor city in China's southern Guangdong province. His father was an elementary school teacher. He studied electronic engineering at Zhejiang University, a prestigious college in the city of Hangzhou, and also earned a master's degree in information and communication engineering there.DeepSeek's research was funded by High-Flyer's R&D budget, Liang said previously. It drew computing resources from the quant fund, which had amassed 10,000 Nvidia GPUs in 2021, prior to US bans on exports of sophisticated Nvidia chips and GPUs.Liang recruited engineering talent almost exclusively from China. Many were fresh out of top universities, interns in their final leg of doctoral studies and Olympiad medal holders. bloomberg","Liang Wenfeng's quantitative hedge fund firm apologised profusely to investors for losing money during a tumultuous period for China's stock market.

Coca-Cola recalls batches of drinks in Europe after failed chlorate-level test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/coca-cola-recalls-batches-of-drinks-in-europe-after-failed-chlorate-level-test/articleshow/117635948.cms,".

Coca-Cola has recalled certain batches of its soft drinks across Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands after routine safety checks at its Ghent production plant revealed higher-than-normal levels of chlorate. The affected products include Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite, Minute Maid, and Fuze Tea, with production codes ranging from 328 GE to 338 GE.Chlorate, a byproduct of chlorine disinfectants used in water treatment, can potentially disrupt thyroid function, especially in children. The European Union's rapid alert system notified health authorities in Denmark, Portugal, and Romania to investigate whether contaminated drinks had reached store shelves or vending machines in those countries. The risk was categorised as ""serious.""Coca-Cola has assured consumers that the issue was traced to a single container used in the water treatment process at its Ghent facility. The company has urged customers not to consume drinks from the affected batches and to return them for refunds. ""We apologise to consumers and our commercial partners,"" Coca-Cola said in a statement.While the recall raised concerns, experts have reassured the public. Philippe Jorens, a professor at Antwerp University Hospital, told Belgian public broadcaster VTM that consuming harmful levels of chlorate from the affected drinks would require ingesting significant quantities.In addition, a small number of potentially contaminated drinks were shipped to France, Germany, and Great Britain, but no recalls were issued in those countries. “We are also in contact with authorities in a very small number of European markets – France, Germany, and Great Britain – where a very limited quantity of stock was also shipped,” the company said.","Routine safety checks at its Ghent production plant revealed higher-than-normal levels of chlorate.

Poll Is DeepSeek's AI Technology Superior to Other Available AI Tools? No, It Still Has a Long Way to Go Yes, It’s a Game Changer

The trigger?

Why it matters

DeepSeek’s announcement is more than a technological milestone—it’s a direct challenge to Silicon Valley’s dominance in AI. For years, US companies like OpenAI and Google have relied on their ability to spend billions on AI infrastructure and development, creating an almost unassailable competitive moat. Nvidia’s dominance in AI chips has fueled a skyrocketing valuation, with its GPUs seen as indispensable for training large language models (LLMs).

But DeepSeek’s revelation threatens to undercut this economic model. By demonstrating that high-performing AI models can be developed cheaply using fewer resources, the company has thrown into question the sustainability of these enormous capital expenditures. If the cost of training AI drops significantly, demand for high-end GPUs, advanced data centers, and specialized cloud services could fall, upending the financial prospects of US tech titans.

Are the DeepSeek fears real?

DeepSeek’s “Sputnik moment”

The scale and efficiency of DeepSeek’s breakthrough have led to comparisons with the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik in 1957—a moment that catalyzed the space race. Silicon Valley heavyweight Marc Andreessen called the R1 model “AI’s Sputnik moment” and “one of the most amazing breakthroughs” in the field. Even President Donald Trump weighed in, describing the development as a “wake-up call” for US industries. “Instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same solution,” he said.

In China, DeepSeek’s success was hailed as a national triumph. Zhou Hongyi , the CEO of Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, declared that the company had “upended the world.” Others called it proof that China was closing the gap with the U.S. in AI technology. The breakthrough has renewed confidence in Beijing’s ability to outmaneuver U.S. sanctions and technological barriers.

Impact on Silicon Valley’s AI giants

Nvidia Stock Beaten Down Due to DeepSeek

The new economics of AI

Geopolitical implications

A turning point for markets

For over two years, artificial intelligence (AI) has driven one of the most dramatic stock market rallies in history. Nvidia, the chipmaking giant and cornerstone of the AI revolution, became synonymous with the soaring optimism surrounding AI’s potential to reshape industries. Yet, on Monday, this euphoria came to a screeching halt. Nvidia suffered a historic $589 billion loss in market value—the largest one-day drop for a company in Wall Street history—sparking widespread panic in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and wiping nearly $1 trillion from global markets.A Chinese startup called DeepSeek , which last week announced a breakthrough in AI technology that threatens to upend the economics of the industry. The Hangzhou-based company introduced its R1 AI model, claiming it could rival the most advanced models from Silicon Valley titans like OpenAI and Google—for a fraction of the cost. The disruptive potential of DeepSeek’s innovation rattled investor confidence, sending ripples through the global tech ecosystem.Monday’s selloff was nothing short of catastrophic. Nvidia’s stock plummeted 17%, marking its lowest point since October and shaving billions off the fortunes of its investors. CEO Jensen Huang alone lost $21 billion from his net worth. Broadcom, another major player in AI chips, saw its shares fall 17.4%, while Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta faced declines ranging from 2% to 4%. Even power utility firms like Vistra and Constellation Energy, which are critical to the data center infrastructure powering AI, saw their stocks fall by 28.3% and 20.8%, respectively.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3%, dragging down the broader S&P 500 tech sector, which fell 5.6%. This was the sector’s worst one-day decline in over four years. By the end of the day, the global market had shed a staggering $1 trillion in value, a sharp reversal of the AI-driven gains that had propelled stocks to record highs over the past two years.DeepSeek, once an obscure startup, emerged as a serious player in the global AI race last week when it announced the release of its R1 model. According to the company, the R1 model can match the performance of OpenAI’s GPT-4 and other leading models while costing just $5.6 million to develop—a fraction of the hundreds of millions or even billions spent by U.S. firms. The company also claimed to have achieved this feat using Nvidia’s less powerful H800 chips, a move born of necessity due to U.S. export restrictions on more advanced GPUs like the H100.The timing of DeepSeek’s announcement could not have been more significant. Its AI chatbot, integrated with the R1 model, quickly became the most downloaded app on Apple’s US App Store, overtaking OpenAI’s ChatGPT. For Silicon Valley, the implications were clear: China had found a way to compete in the high-stakes AI game without the massive capital investments and infrastructure traditionally required.Despite the dramatic market response, not everyone is convinced of DeepSeek’s claims. Analysts like Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein and Atif Malik of Citigroup have questioned whether the R1 model can truly rival US counterparts at such a low cost. They pointed out that while DeepSeek may have used less advanced hardware, its ability to achieve cutting-edge performance without significant investments in GPUs remains debatable.There are also suspicions about how DeepSeek obtained its hardware. Elon Musk, who has heavily invested in Nvidia chips for his company xAI, speculated that DeepSeek may have acquired banned H100 chips through indirect channels. Alexandr Wang, CEO of Scale AI, echoed this sentiment, claiming that Chinese firms “have more H100s than people think.” Nvidia, however, stated that DeepSeek’s technology was “fully export control compliant.”The broader implications of DeepSeek’s rise are significant for U.S. tech companies. For years, firms like Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI have built their dominance on the premise that AI requires immense capital expenditure. Nvidia, for instance, has sold billions of dollars’ worth of high-end GPUs, becoming a linchpin of the AI revolution. But if DeepSeek’s claims hold, the demand for such hardware could decline, undermining the economic model that has driven the industry’s explosive growth.Nevertheless, some industry leaders see opportunity in DeepSeek’s innovation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the R1 model “an impressive competitor” and pledged to accelerate his company’s product releases. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella argued that cheaper AI would democratize access and drive broader adoption, potentially benefiting the global economy.DeepSeek’s announcement has forced a reevaluation of the economics of AI. For years, the development of large language models (LLMs) has been characterized by ballooning costs and resource-intensive processes. OpenAI’s GPT-4 reportedly cost over $100 million to train, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei suggested that some models are approaching $1 billion in development costs.In contrast, DeepSeek has demonstrated that advanced AI can be developed at a fraction of the cost, potentially reshaping how companies approach AI investments. This shift could benefit smaller players and startups, but it also raises questions about the billions already spent by Silicon Valley giants on data centers and infrastructure.DeepSeek’s success has broader geopolitical ramifications. The US has sought to curb China’s AI development through export controls and sanctions, limiting access to cutting-edge chips and technology. However, DeepSeek’s achievements suggest that these measures have not only failed but may have spurred innovation. By focusing on efficiency and resourcefulness, Chinese firms like DeepSeek are proving that they can compete with—and possibly surpass—their US counterparts.President Trump’s administration may now face pressure to tighten export restrictions further, a move that could escalate tensions with Beijing. At the same time, policymakers will need to consider how to foster innovation at home while maintaining a competitive edge.For investors, Monday’s selloff serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with overexposure to a single narrative. The AI boom, while transformative, has also fueled speculative behavior, with tech stocks reaching valuations that some argue are unsustainable. Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro, urged caution, noting that “panicking rarely makes for a good investment decision.”Yet, others see a silver lining. Lower costs could make AI more accessible, driving widespread adoption across industries and fueling long-term economic growth. As Joseph Amato of Neuberger Berman put it, “If you can invest less for a powerful model that has wider adoption, that’s got to be a good thing for the broad-based economy.”(With inputs from agencies)","A Chinese startup called DeepSeek announced a breakthrough in AI technology that threatens to upend the economics of the industry.

The Chinese artificial intelligence app has soared to the No. 1 spot in Apple's App Store productivity category across major markets including the US, UK, China and India, overtaking ChatGPT and other rivals in the generative AI space.In Google Play in India, DeepSeek was only at No. 26 and ChatGPT at No. 4 in the productivity category, but this could change in the coming days with the attention it is receiving.Among DeepSeek’s rivals building large language models (LLMs), Perplexity founder & CEO Aravind Srinivas was the only one to make a public comment on the Chinese company’s accomplishment. He congratulated DeepSeek, and noted on X: “For a while, it wasn't clear who would beat ChatGPT for the first time. The best we (Perplexity) could manage was #8, a year ago. Look forward to using all their (DeepSeek’s) models for search, assistant, and agents this year.”Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made an indirect reference to it. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, he said, ""We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.""DeepSeek is founded by Liang Wenfeng, who previously founded a hedge fund. What makes its achievement noteworthy has been its ability to make a ChatGPT-class language model at a fraction of ChatGPT’s cost. DeepSeek’s R1 AI model is said to match or even beat the likes of ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini on multiple parameters. What’s more, it’s free, unlike ChatGPT that has a very limited free version.Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the marquee venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and an advisor to US President Donald Trump, described DeepSeek’s accomplishment as “AI’s Sputnik moment,” making a reference to a period of anxiety among Western nations about a possible technological gap between the US and the Soviet Union when the latter launched the Sputnik satellite. Social media platform X was abuzz with DeepSeek around this. While some took potshots at companies such as OpenAI, which was founded 10 years ago, raised about $17.9 billion in funding, and has an employee base of thousands, others cast doubts on DeepSeek’s claims of spending less than $6 million to build R1.US venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya said: “We need to get better at taking huge shots on goal and allocating capital to the best of these ideas. I worry that in this current melee, we’ve overspent billions on dumb features which these next-gen models will roll over in the next 12 months or earlier. Lots of capital losses are coming.” Garry Tan, CEO of famed Silicon Valley-based startup accelerator Y Combinator, said DeepSeek’s search feels more sticky even after a few queries “because seeing the reasoning, even how earnest it is about what it knows and what it might not know, increases user trust by quite a lot.”Vaibhav Domkundwar, founder & CEO of Better Capital, told TOI that R1 is significant because it changes the game entirely. “It is not about proving what its real cost is… we will know a lot more in the coming days, but it will disprove a lot of the narrative pushed by OpenAI and others,” he said.","DeepSeek has soared to the No. 1 spot in Apple's App Store productivity category across major markets including the US, UK, China and India.

The world’s 500 richest people, led by Nvidia Corp . co-founder Jensen Huang, lost a combined $108 billion on Monday as a tech-led selloff tied to Chinese AI developer DeepSeek sent major indices plunging.Billionaires whose fortunes are linked to artificial intelligence were the biggest losers: Huang saw his fortune fall $20.1 billion, a 20% drop, while Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison ’s $22.6 billion loss was larger in absolute terms, but represented just 12% of his fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Dell Inc.’s Michael Dell lost $13 billion, and Binance Holdings Ltd. co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao shaved $12.1 billion.Tech-sector titans as a group saw $94 billion of wealth evaporate — roughly 85% of the Bloomberg index’s total decline. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.1%, and the S&P 500 dropped 1.5%.Hangzhou-based DeepSeek has been developing AI models since 2023, but the company first came onto the radar of many Western investors this weekend as its free DeepSeek R1 chatbot app topped download charts worldwide. So many new users piled in that DeepSeek struggled to keep the app online, suffering outages and forcing it to restrict signups to users with Chinese phone numbers.DeepSeek’s dark-horse entry into the AI race, which it says cost just $5.6 million to develop, is a challenge to Silicon Valley’s narrative that massive capital spending is essential to developing the strongest models. That delivered a serious blow to billionaires whose fortunes are tied to the Western AI supply chain that’s been the equities market’s biggest driver over the past two years.Also Read | 'Sputnik moment': Chinese DeepSeek wipes off $1 trillion from US tech giants in a day Soaring valuations for so-called AI hyperscalers — including Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — have generated billions in wealth for their owners since OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in November 2022. These companies have for the most part operated on a similar playbook: Spend huge sums to develop and run AI systems by hoarding top-of-the-line semiconductors and the energy supplies needed to run them.Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced Friday that the company planned to spend $60 billion to $65 billion on projects related to AI this year, well above Wall Street estimates. Capital spending across all Big Tech firms is on pace to reach $200 billion in 2025, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report.Despite limited revenue to show for all their investment so far, markets have rewarded US tech stocks with record-high valuations, which have in turn generated historic wealth gains for their owners. Nvidia has stood out as the AI boom’s biggest single winner so far, with Huang’s net worth increasing almost eight-fold to $121 billion since the start of 2023 through Friday. Zuckerberg’s fortune soared 385% to $229 billion over the same period and Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos gained 133% to $254 billion.While Huang and Ellison suffered losses, other major tech billionaires’ fortunes escaped unscathed. Zuckerberg’s net worth ended the day up, gaining $4.3 billion as Meta rebounded from an early-session decline. Bezos’ wealth climbed by about $632 million.The fact that DeepSeek was able to develop a free model that potentially rivals or beats competitors including ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude at a fraction of the development cost led investors to question the logic behind Silicon Valley’s dependence on capital spending.A key reason why DeepSeek didn’t rely on big investment and top-of-the-line chips to develop its model is that Chinese firms have had limited access to the powerful GPUs, or graphics processing units, most Western companies rely on ever since the US government instituted strict export controls on the most advanced chips.In an interview with CNBC last week, Alexandr Wang, CEO of training data provider Scale AI, said that despite the export controls, DeepSeek and other Chinese developers likely have more GPUs than Silicon Valley is aware of.“The Chinese labs have more H100s than people think,” Wang said, referring to Nvidia’s top-of-the-line AI chip. “My understanding is that DeepSeek has about 50,000 H100s, which they can’t talk about, obviously, because it’s against the export controls that the US has in place.”",The world’s 500 richest people lost a combined $108 billion on Monday as a tech- led selloff tied to Chinese AI developer DeepSeek sent major indices plunging.

DeepSeek’s sudden fame strains its systems and draws attacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/deepseeks-sudden-fame-strains-its-systems-and-draws-attacks/articleshow/117615910.cms,"Talk of an artificial-intelligence upstart in China behind a formidable ChatGPT rival had been building for days.At the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, some mentioned Hangzhou-based DeepSeek and its recently released R1 model as a prime reason for countries such as the US to be doubling down on AI advancements. On tech chat boards, engineers had begun comparing its programming performance to leading models from the likes of OpenAI and Microsoft Corp. Its product quietly rose through the ranks of top performers on a UC Berkeley-affiliated AI leaderboard.Then, within the past 36 hours, interest in the startup exploded. Silicon Valley heavyweights including investor Marc Andreessen and AI godfather and chief Meta Platforms Inc. scientist Yann LeCun began piling into the conversation, with Andreessen calling DeepSeek’s model “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs” he’s ever seen.By the end of the weekend, DeepSeek’s AI assistant had rocketed to the top of Apple Inc.’s iPhone download charts and ranked among the top downloads on Google’s Play Store, straining the startup’s systems so much that the service went down for more than an hour. The company was eventually forced to limit signups to those with mainland China telephone numbers — but claimed the move was the result of “large-scale malicious attacks” on its services.The fallout from the seemingly overnight surge in interest around DeepSeek was swift, and severe: The company’s AI model , which it claims to have developed at a fraction of the cost of rivals without meaningfully sacrificing performance, drove a nearly $1 trillion rout in US and European technology stocks as investors questioned the spending plans of some of America’s biggest companies. The share plunge in AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. alone wiped out a record $589 billion in stock-market value from the world’s largest company on Monday.Some stocks, including Nvidia, later erased some losses in after-hours trading.By Monday, it was clear the overwhelming interest in DeepSeek’s services was taking a toll on the company’s system. “Currently, only registration with a mainland China mobile phone number is supported,” the startup said on its status page. DeepSeek did not specify whether the signup curbs are temporary or how long they will last.It was the company’s longest major outage since it started reporting its status. Unlike some rivals, DeepSeek’s assistant shows its work and reasoning as it addresses a user’s written query or prompt. Reviews on Apple’s app store and on Alphabet Inc.’s Android Play Store praised that transparency.Founded by quant fund chief Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek’s open-sourced AI model is spurring a rethink of the billions of dollars that companies have been spending to stay ahead in the AI race.“While it remains to be seen if DeepSeek will prove to be a viable, cheaper alternative in the long term, initial worries are centered on whether US tech giants’ pricing power is being threatened and if their massive AI spending needs re-evaluation,” said Jun Rong Yeap of IG Asia.Like all other Chinese-made AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed politically sensitive in China. Unlike ChatGPT, DeepSeek deflects questions about Tiananmen Square, President Xi Jinping or the possibility of China invading Taiwan. That may prove jarring to international users, who may not have come into direct contact with Chinese chatbots earlier.The initial success provides a counterpoint to expectations that the most advanced AI will require increasing amounts of computing power and energy —- an assumption that has driven shares in Nvidia and its suppliers to all-time highs.The exact cost of development and energy consumption of DeepSeek are not fully documented, but the startup has presented figures that suggest its cost was only a fraction of OpenAI’s latest models. That a small and efficient AI model emerged from China, which has been subject to escalating US trade sanctions on advanced Nvidia chips, is also challenging the effectiveness of such measures.“The US is great at research and innovation and especially breakthrough, but China is better at engineering,” computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee said earlier this month at the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong. “In this day and age, when you have limited compute power and money, you learn how to build things very efficiently.”For its part, Nvidia — the biggest provider of chips used to train AI software — described DeepSeek’s new model as an “excellent AI advancement” that fully complies with the US government’s restrictions on technology exports. The startup’s work “illustrates how new models can be created” using a technique known as test time scaling, the company said.Nvidia’s statement appeared to dismiss some analysts’ and experts’ suspicions that the Chinese startup couldn’t have made the breakthrough it has claimed. The company also pointed out that inference, the work of actually running AI models and using it to process data and make predictions, nonetheless requires a lot of its products.“Inference requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking,” the company said.","Hangzhou-based DeepSeek and its recently released R1 model is a prime reason for countries such as the US to be doubling down on AI advancements.

For perspective, that's nearly equal to the combined market value of the top three companies in India: Reliance Industries, TCS and HDFC Bank.Initial test results for DeepSeek R1 model showed better efficiency compared to the latest version of ChatGPT, currently the global leader in AI applications. Analysts now feel that the low development and running costs of the Chinese AI model with better results than ChatGPT could lead to a massive slide in stock prices of high cost AI-chip manufacturers like Nvidia, TSMC and others.Earlier in the day, trading on Dalal Street was also impacted by the global turmoil on the back of DeepSeek's superior performance and its implications for global tech giants. Combined with relentless foreign fund selling, the sensex closed 824 points down at 75,366 points, a more than seven-month closing low. Technology stocks led the slide.With US markets deep in the red in early trades and the US Federal Reserve's rate setting committee meeting scheduled later this week, domestic investors are still edgy, market players said. However, they could take some solace from GIFT Nifty index, a proxy for start of trading in the domestic market for the next session, which was in the positive territory late on Monday.On Dalal Street on Monday, the sensex opened in the red and lost steam through the session to close near the day's low. In addition to the global cues, tepid corporate earnings and uncertainty around US trade policy also impacted investor sentiment, said Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services.","Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released its low-cost AI model that prompted tech analysts to question if the current high valuations for giants like Nvidia, Google and Microsoft were justified.

NEW YORK: US chip-maker Nvidia led a rout in tech stocks Monday after the emergence of a low-cost Chinese generative AI model that could threaten American dominance in the fast-growing industry.The chatbot developed by DeepSeek, a startup based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, has apparently shown the ability to match the capacity of US AI pace-setters for a fraction of the investments made by American companies.Shares in Nvidia, whose semiconductors power the AI industry, fell nearly 17 percent on Wall Street, erasing nearly $600 billion of its market value.The tech-rich Nasdaq index finished down more than three percent.DeepSeek, whose chatbot became the top-rated free application on Apple's US App Store, said it spent only $5.6 million developing its model -- peanuts when compared with the billions US tech giants have poured into AI.US ""tech dominance is being challenged by China,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB.""The focus is now on whether China can do it better, quicker and more cost effectively than the US, and if they could win the AI race,"" she said.Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B.

Innovation has always defined the crypto market, but Ethereum (ETH) is transforming the space by introducing smart contracts and a basis for distributed apps (dApps). Rexas Finance is positioned to revolutionise asset trading and ownership with a strong ecosystem, innovative use cases, and a fast-growing community.Real-world asset tokenising is blockchain digital tokenisation of physical assets, including real estate, commodities, intellectual property, and luxury goods. These tokens reflect fractional ownership, enabling anyone to invest valuable assets without requiring large capital. This idea offers a window into the future of world finance by democratising wealth-building opportunities and raising asset liquidity. However, for RWA tokenisation to be fully realised, a strong blockchain environment is required, and that's where Rexas Finance can help.Rexas Finance is a platform meant to enable the flawless tokenisation, trading, and management of actual assets, and it is not only a cryptocurrency project. Selling 411.4 million tokens, priced at $0.175 during its 11th presale, RXS has already raised over $38.6 million and is fast becoming a game-changer in the cryptocurrency market. Rexas Finance is bringing tools and infrastructure to enable RWA tokenisation for the general public, just as Ethereum presented a fresh paradigm with smart contracts.1.One main feature distinguishing Rexas Finance from others is the advanced tokenisation of real-world assets tradeable on its blockchain. This enables intermediary stakeholdings, which gives current investors the capacity to diversify into spaces that were previously the sole terrain of institutional investors.2.The integration of artificial intelligence provides customers with real-time statistics and predictive models for asset performance. This technological edge sets Rexas Finance apart from its competitors and aligns it with future finance trends.3.The platform’s Certik audit guarantees investors of its security and reliability. This level of transparency and confidence is vital in a market that requires a robust base to attract retail and institutional investors.4.Rexas Finance is building a borderless financial environment by combining blockchain technology with conventional finance. Its capacity to reach RWAs worldwide reflects Ethereum's influence on distributed apps and DeFi.Ethereum helped set the groundwork for blockchain innovation by adding smart contracts that run anything from distributed exchanges to NFT markets today. As the preferred platform for fractionalising and trading real-world assets, Rexas Finance has the same ability to accomplish RWA tokenisation. Rexas Finance democratises access to high-value assets, enabling anyone to engage in wealth-building prospects, as Ethereum made blockchain technologies available to developers. Early investors in Ethereum witnessed great gains as the platform's value and acceptance developed. With RXS currently in its presale phase at $0.175, early adopters can position themselves for exponential development. Ethereum's success rests in its capacity to host a large spectrum of dApps. Similarly, Rexas Finance is creating an ecosystem supporting tokeniSed assets ranging from intellectual property to real estate across sectors.The worldwide RWA tokenising market will be worth a trillion dollars over the next decade. This development drives demand for asset liquidity, blockchain knowledge, and higher institutional use. Rexas Finance is ideally situated in this regard to profit from the growing demand.The excitement around Rexas Finance is mounting. Early adopters drawn to the project's original approach and solid foundations are seasoned investors and crypto whales. As the presale picks up, the token is drawing interest as one of the investment prospects of 2025. Furthermore, listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko and its strong security add credibility.Like Ethereum, Rexas Finance faced competition and government inspection issues in its early years. Still, its clear road map and emphasis on innovation helped it overcome these challenges. The opportunity resides in its ability to acquire a big piece of the RWA tokenisation market, which remains mostly untapped. If successful, Rexas Finance might fight Ethereum and carve out its legacy in the blockchain arena.Rexas Finance is more than a promising cryptocurrency; it’s a pioneer in the RWA tokenisation revolution. RXS has the potential to become as transforming as Ethereum was for dApps and DeFi with its presale price of $0.175 and aim to democratise access to high-value assets. Rexas Finance is one initiative that might change the financial scene as the crypto sector looks beyond 2025 and beyond. For investors seeking the next Ethereum-like opportunity, RXS offers a strong reason to act immediately and grab a seat in this innovative enterprise.","Rexas Finance (RXS) aims to revolutionise asset trading and ownership with a strong ecosystem, innovative use cases, and a fast-growing community.

Kazuo Ueda, set to speak to reporters later in the day, repeatedly indicated the move was coming. Recent price data show inflation hovering at about the central bank's 2% target.Government data released hours before the decision showed consumer prices, excluding volatile food prices, rose last year at an average rate of 2.5%, marking the third straight year of increase. The consumer price index, excluding food, for the month of December alone showed a 3% rise.Another long-term concern was wage growth. Recent data show Japanese workers are gaining better wages and are generally set to receive solid pay raises in their upcoming annual union negotiations.The labor ministry adjusted its wage data for November to a rise of 0.5%, instead of a decline, helping to support the Bank of Japan's decision.The central bank has signaled that more interest rate raises may be coming, while stressing it plans to be extremely cautious to ensure the economy holds steady.Share prices fell after the announcement, as the value of the Japanese yen gained against the US dollar. A rate rise in July last year sent stock prices tumbling. The bank is also watching for market reactions to the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.The Bank of Japan increased the rate for the first time in 17 years in March last year, ending its negative interest rate policy, which amounts to negative borrowing rates.Japan's longtime ultra-lax monetary policy was meant to wrest the economy out of deflationary tendencies and boost growth. Deflation stagnates growth, as companies invest less, cut back on wages and people hold back on spending.Japan's stance is at odds with the loosening trends adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which have been cutting rates after raising them to clamp down on inflation. The Fed indicated recently it will slow the pace of rate cuts.",The Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate to about 0.5% from 0.25% Friday.

Justin Trudeau warns Donald Trump over tariff threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/prices-for-americans-will-go-up-trudeau-warns-trump-over-tariff-threat/articleshow/117503660.cms,"Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump (R)

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday warned that American consumers will face higher prices if US President Donald Trump proceeds with plans to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products.Trump announced earlier in the day that he intends to apply a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, with implementation potentially starting as soon as February 1. He had previously threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China immediately after taking office, but they were not implemented on his first day.Speaking in Ottawa, outgoing PM Trudeau pointed out that Canada would respond with retaliatory tariffs if Trump moves forward. ""Whether it be back on January 20th, on February 1st or February 15th as a Valentine’s Day present, or on April 1st or whenever, Canada will respond,"" Trudeau said. ""Prices for American consumers on just about everything will go up. We don’t think he wants that.""The tariffs would target a wide range of products and could disrupt key markets, including autos, lumber, and oil. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith cautioned that Americans in some states could see gas prices increase by more than a dollar per gallon if Canadian oil faces additional tariffs. Despite Trump’s assertion that the US does not need Canada, nearly 25% of America’s daily oil consumption is supplied by its northern neighbour.Canada is also a critical supplier of 34 essential minerals and metals, as well as the largest foreign source of steel, aluminium, and uranium for the US Trudeau highlighted the importance of bilateral cooperation.""The US should be working even more with Canada on our energy, on our critical minerals, on the goods they need to deliver the economic growth that Donald Trump has promised,"" he said. ""That is our first choice. If they do move forward on tariffs, we are ready to respond in a strong way but in a way to figure out how to get them removed as soon as possible.""Canada is reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs on US products such as orange juice, toilets, and certain steel goods. This would mirror the response in 2018, when Canada imposed billions of dollars in duties after Trump raised tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. ""Everything is on the table,” Trudeau said. “It would be bad for Canada, but it would also be bad for American consumers.""The economic relationship between the two countries is significant, with nearly Canadian dollars 3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) in goods and services crossing the border daily. Canada is also the top export destination for 36 US states. However, Trump has remained focused on border issues, linking Canada and Mexico to the flow of fentanyl into the US""We have highlighted that less than one percent of illegal drugs coming into the United States, less than one percent of migrants going into the United States, come from Canada, but we’re still investing over a billion dollars and strengthening our border,"" Trudeau said.Trump has also frequently mischaracterised the US-Canada trade relationship, claiming a $200 billion trade deficit, which experts have debunked. During a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum, he suggested a drastic solution. “You can always become a state, and if you’re a state, we don’t have a deficit. We won’t have to tariff you,” he said.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned that American consumers will face higher prices if US President Donald Trump proceeds with plans to impose sweeping tariffs.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

Stock market recommendations:Bharti Airtel's FCF generation has surged to INR292b in 9MFY25, driven by tariff hikes and reduced capex post-5G rollout. The company has prepaid ~INR670b in high-cost spectrum debt since FY22, improving leverage. With FY25-27 FCF expected to reach ~INR500b annually, capital allocation becomes a key focus. Bharti's revenue/EBITDA is projected to grow at a 15%/19% CAGR over FY24-27, supported by tariff hikes and Indus consolidation. Key monitorables include FCF deployment and potential AGR relief.Management expects double-digit revenue growth in FY25, supported by strong demand from weddings, tourism, and MICE events. ARR and occupancy remain robust. The company’s expansion into spiritual tourism aligns with the government’s push to develop 50 key tourist destinations, with IH planning over 2,800 new rooms across Ayodhya, Hampi, Vrindavan, Ujjain, Prayagraj, and Makkah in the next three to five years. A healthy room addition pipeline, favorable demand-supply trends, and govt support for tourism position IH well for sustained growth. We expect revenue/EBITDA/adj. PAT to grow 31%/34%/26% YoY.","According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting March 10, 2025) are Bharti Airtel and Indian Hotels.

Golden Visa Benefits:

In today's uncertain and dynamic global environment, affluent individuals seek alternative arrangements for themselves and their loved ones - arrangements that provide secure havens during turbulent times whilst enabling enhanced access to worldwide commercial and lifestyle prospects.

Golden visas serve as strategic tools for affluent individuals seeking to safeguard their wealth and enhance their global mobility. These programmes are said to offer a reliable safeguard against economic and political uncertainties in an unstable global environment.

The golden visa scheme enables high net worth persons to establish residence in financially advantageous jurisdictions whilst securing comprehensive residential rights, including access to employment, educational institutions and healthcare facilities in the host country.

Some Available Golden Visa Programmes for Indians

According to an ET report, despite tightening regulations, Indian applicants can still access several golden visa schemes:

Portugal continues to offer residency through investments in qualified funds, scientific research initiatives, or business expansion projects.

Greece has adjusted its programme, raising the real estate investment threshold to €400,000, whilst offering a €250,000 alternative route through local startup investments.

Spain's scheme remains accessible to investors who submitted applications prior to 2024, despite plans to discontinue the programme.

Malta maintains its citizenship by investment option, subject to thorough background checks.

Various Caribbean nations, including St. Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and Saint Lucia, provide passports for investments beginning at $200,000.

The UAE golden visa programme continues to welcome Indian investors and professionals from essential sectors, including healthcare, technology, and business.

Singapore's Global Investor Program, whilst not technically a golden visa, enables permanent residency through substantial local business investments.

Golden visa programmes: Countries around the world are strengthening restrictions on unauthorised immigration, whilst maintaining pathways for investment-based residency. Investment visa schemes provide opportunities to obtain residential status or nationality through monetary commitments. Although traditionally popular amongst Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern investors, these programmes now draw applicants from across the globe.Golden visas allow for investment-linked residency on a temporary or permanent basis. These are linked to applicants making qualifying financial contributions, including property acquisition, enterprise establishment or state fund deposits. The flexible residency requirements of certain programmes appeal to those seeking alternative options whilst retaining freedom of movement.A golden visa programme is a legal pathway where qualified individuals receive residential privileges in a country by making specified financial investments. This differs from citizenship-by-investment schemes, which provide complete citizenship benefits. Through golden visas, wealthy individuals can obtain legal residency status, allowing them to live, pursue employment, education and access healthcare services in their chosen nation.Nations increasingly provide residence and citizenship through investment schemes such as golden visa programmes, featuring diverse investment choices tailored to individual family needs.Golden passports provide ""citizenship by investment”. They deliver comprehensive citizenship privileges, frequently including admission to regional economic zones. Within the European Union, Malta's scheme enables investors to live, work and pursue education across all EU member states. In the Caribbean region, nations including St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Grenada provide competitive options beginning at approximately $200,000.US President Donald Trump has introduced the ""gold card"" scheme as a replacement for the existing EB-5 visa system. This initiative would grant residency rights and citizenship prospects in exchange for a $5 million investment. Unlike the current EB-5 programme, the proposed scheme suggests direct payment to the US government to address national debt. This arrangement could present an alternative solution for Indian investors facing extensive waiting periods in the current employment-based green card system.",Golden visas allow for investment-linked residency on a temporary or permanent basis.

‘System intervention’: What Infosys is doing to ensure 10-day work from office by employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/system-intervention-what-infosys-is-doing-to-ensure-10-day-work-from-office-by-employees/articleshow/118748236.cms,"Department heads at the Bengaluru-based organisation sent emails to their team members, instructing them to restrict their work-from-home requests.

Infosys work from office rules: Infosys, the second-largest software services firm in India, has issued a directive on Wednesday requiring its technology staff to comply with the work from office for 10 days monthly mandate, aiming to increase on-campus attendance. Infosys has implemented a new attendance system via a mobile application that mandates employees to be physically present at their designated office locations for at least 10 days monthly. The system will not automatically approve work-from-home requests, according to a senior staff member who requested not to be named.A colleague mentioned this requirement is primarily driven by project needs rather than departmental demands.Department heads at the Bengaluru-based organisation sent emails to their team members, instructing them to restrict their work-from-home requests starting March 10, according to sources who spoke to ET.Also Read | How will Elon Musk-led DOGE’s slashing of federal spending impact Indian IT companies? The email reportedly said: ""To support this, starting March 10, 2025, system interventions will be implemented to limit the number of work-from-home days that can be applied each month. These measures are designed to ensure compliance with the new hybrid work requirements while maintaining flexibility for employees.""A senior executive explained that this systematic approach aims to foster better team collaboration whilst maintaining workplace flexibility.The email further said: ""As you know, our hybrid work model expects employees to work from the office for at least 10 days a month, or as per business requirements, whichever is higher.""This directive specifically affects staff at job level 5 (JL5) and below, encompassing team leaders, software engineers, senior engineers, system engineers and consultants. Whilst JL6 and above positions, including managers, senior managers, delivery managers and senior delivery managers (excluding vice presidents), are not included in this mandate.Another staff member expressed concerns about the policy, noting that remote work had provided benefits in terms of reduced travel time and physical strain. They suggested this might affect work output for certain individuals.Also Read | Infosys trainee termination issue: Laid-off employees petition Prime Minister's Office to intervene Internal sources indicate that failing to meet the office attendance requirement by one or two days would result in deductions from the employee's leave allocation.In comparison, TCS, Infosys' primary competitor, has linked employees' variable compensation to their adherence to a five-day office attendance policy.The shift towards office-based work follows the pandemic period when tech firms adopted remote working. Factors including economic slowdown, concerns over employee moonlighting, and efforts to strengthen workplace culture have prompted Infosys and other tech companies to implement office attendance policies.On November 20, 2023, Infosys launched its return-to-office initiative.

Stock market today : Indian benchmark indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty50 , remained largely unchanged on Friday, following a 2% increase in the previous two sessions. While Reliance Industries showed positive movement, IT stocks declined amid worries about US tariffs and unstable trade policies affecting global markets .The BSE Sensex finished at 74,332.58, down by 7.51 points or 0.01%, whilst the Nifty 50 settled at 22,552.50, up by 7.80 points or 0.03%.The total market value of BSE-listed companies decreased by Rs 697 crore to Rs 398.26 lakh crore.Technology stocks faced pressure, with the IT index dropping 0.9%, as these companies generate substantial revenue from the US market. Major tech firms Infosys and HCL Technologies saw declines exceeding 1.6%.Reliance Industries, ranking second in market weight among index constituents, recorded a 3% increase, leading gains across both indices.The automobile sector index concluded marginally higher by 0.1%, surrendering earlier gains. CLSA indicated that potential removal of import duties on US vehicles would not significantly affect Indian car manufacturers.In specific stock movements, Bharat Electronics gained 1.5% after receiving orders worth Rs 577 crore, whilst Gensol Engineering continued its downward trend for the eighth straight session, falling 2.5% following credit rating downgrades by CARE and ICRA.The property sector index Nifty Realty fell by 1.2%, with prominent developers like Godrej Properties, Lodha, Prestige Estates, and Raymond seeing declines of 2-3%.The previous two trading sessions had witnessed the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex rise approximately 2% each, supported by positive sentiment regarding potential US tariff reductions on Canadian and Mexican imports, lower oil prices, and value buying following recent market declines.Following Indian trading hours on Thursday, US President Donald Trump declared the suspension of 25% tariffs on the majority of Mexican and Canadian imports, further complicating an already unpredictable trade policy that has disrupted international financial markets.Investors maintained a cautious stance whilst awaiting crucial US employment statistics and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's address.Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, noted that global markets face significant uncertainty due to US tariff implementations and retaliatory threats from trading partners. This uncertainty has reduced risk appetite and equity attractiveness, with emerging markets particularly affected by substantial capital outflows.""Lately, the S&P 500 index is showing signs of a deeper correction, reflecting concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on the US economy. In contrast, Indian markets have demonstrated resilience off late despite looming trade war. While a recovery in corporate earnings could significantly improve the domestic sentiments.

As nations fret over the economic fallout of Donald Trump’s tariff tactics, India’s policymakers urged business leaders to seize the moment, promising “ten steps of support for every one taken”, putting national interests forward.“Every challenge — whether it’s geo-economic fragmentation, tariff wars, deflationary trends, or declining global demand — presents an opportunity. This mindset is something we draw from the Prime Minister, who often says that every challenge contains multiple opportunities,” said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in a fireside chat at the ET Awards on Saturday. She added that a Viksit Bharat would need enhanced trade and exports.She highlighted the shift from protection to pragmatism, stating, “We must guard against dumping, while ensuring that Indian manufacturers — especially small and medium enterprises — get access to affordable inputs. The key is to strike a balance: Allow cheaper inputs without becoming a victim of dumping.” She also comforted industry by promising a reduction in GST.Sitharaman’s colleague, railways, IT and I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said geopolitical shifts would ultimately strengthen India. Both ministers pushed to revive animal spirits, with Vaishnaw urging industry to invest in 25-30 key products. “If you take one step forward, govt is there to take 10 steps with you,” he said.Calling for a shift in mindset, Sitharaman asked industry leaders, “Are you living today, or are you living in the 60s and 70s?” She said that while some may doubt govt’s growth figures, global agencies affirm India is the fastest-growing economy, with every sector expanding. She added that just as sentiment drives markets, it shapes the economy, warning that “the youth will put us through the grind, if we continue with all the naysaying in spite of all the achievements”.Echoing her sentiments, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, a third-time ET Award winner, said: “From the perspective of leading a conglomerate across 40 countries, I’d say there are two regions that we consider permanent bets: India and North America. India’s story remains strong. Many of the challenges we face are shared by other large economies, but the way to compete globally is by investing, not waiting.”The 25th ET Awards reflected India’s evolving journey — from 90s optimism to global ambitions, post-crisis resilience, start-up exuberance, and now a more mature phase — focusing less on numbers and more on national interest and doing good.Kumar Mangalam captured the essence, quoting his late great grandfather GD Birla, “How does one judge a company? Does the criteria depend solely on profitability, market share, and product ratings? Or, is there something deeper, more human? We believe what truly matters is how much the company cares, how socially involved it is, and how much it improves the quality of life for the people around it.”Noel Tata, chairman, Tata Trusts, known for his reserved public presence throughout his 40-year tenure with the Tata Group, made a rare public statement at the ET Awards, delivering a four minute speech about late Ratan Tata, while accepting the Jewel of India award.This marked his first public remarks on Ratan Tata after taking charge of Tata Trusts in Oct 2024 and his first joint public appearance with Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran to pay tributes to Ratan Tata. Noel Tata said while Ratan Tata’s achievements in business made him famous, there was so much more to him. “His vision for Tata Trusts expanded its philanthropic efforts, and in his personal capacity, he was always willing to help those in need. Empathy came naturally to him, and this was evident in the many lives he touched.”Chandrasekaran chose not to dwell on numbers, while speaking about Ratan Tata. “Since this is an Eco nomic Times award, one might expect a speech about financial achievements — revenues, market capitalisation, profits. But knowing him closely, I can say those numbers never mattered to him as much,” said Chandrasekaran. The chief of Tata Group recounted an incident during 2017 renovation of iconic Bombay House, when Ratan Tata’s primary concern was where the dogs, sheltered there, would go.Often likened to the Oscars of business, the ET Awards took a more mature turn this year, highlighting the unseen side of businessmen—especially through the women in their lives—coinciding with International Women's Day.Vishakha Mulye, CEO of Aditya Birla Capital and winner of Businesswoman of the Year award, highlighted how the stars have to be fully aligned for one half of the country’s population to succeed. “There’s a famous saying that behind every successful man, there is a woman. But, for women to succeed, many things need to fall into place — from the families they are born into, families they marry into, institutions they work with, and ecosystems they operate in. I consider myself fortunate that all these factors aligned for me”. She spoke of how many women executives at ICICI were a source of support, while facing challenges in balancing personal life and career.Personal tributes replaced conventional introductions. Mallika Srinivasan, CEO of Tafe, reflected on her husband, Ve nu Srinivasan, chairman emeritus, TVS Motor. Ananya Birla, founder of Svatantra Microfin, spoke of her father, Kumar Mangalam Birla, whose delight at winning a third ET Award prompted the family to clear their schedules. Nidhi Bansal highlighted Lenskart co-founder Peyush Bansal’s commitment to family, teamwork, and social impact. Malika Noor Mehta, niece of Fareed Zakaria, offered a portrait of her uncle as a man of rare intellect and generosity, adept at distilling complexity into clarity.","The 25th ET Awards reflected India’s evolving journey — from 90s to global ambitions, post-crisis resilience, start-up exuberance, and more on national and doing good.

Panel readies 23-point best practices for states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/panel-readies-23-point-best-practices-for-states/articleshow/118824627.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: The Centre is readying a 23-point template for reforms and deregulation , including some related to land, labour, utilities and permits at the state level, as it seeks to make life easier for businesses to operate across the country.The moves are being piloted by a taskforce on deregulation and compliance reduction led by cabinet secretary TV Somanathan, following PM Narendra Modi’s call for reforms at the state level, which he flagged during a meeting of chief secretaries, and was subsequently flagged in the Economic Survey. The panel is in addition to the Deregulation Commission, which is in the pipeline.While seeking to usher in a single window clearance mechanism for companies, the committee, which met on Friday, is also looking at areas where inspections can be reduced and how no-objection certificates can be issued without inspection, which often delays and complicates matters. The committee of secretaries is looking at procedural changes and greater use of technology to reduce the need to visit govt offices.The validity of permits and licences is proposed to be made longer so that time is not wasted. “The idea is to provide for self-certification and third-party certification so that it is simpler for businesses,” said an officer.When it comes to land, which has been a major area of concern for investors, the proposals being looked at include ways to deregulate land use changes and allowing for changes in floor area ratio in a more transparent manner. The panel is also trying to look at land use patterns for industrial projects and represent them on GIS.In the case of labour regulations , the task force is examining how greater flexibility can be provided in working hours and over-time within the current legal parameters. For instance, while allowing workers to work a maximum 48 hours a week, businesses may be allowed to flexibility in daily working hours. Similarly, a key issue that is sought to be addressed is making it easier for women to work by making it flexible and ensuring that working conditions suit them.Sources said that the plan is to share the best practices many of which are being implemented in some of the states already.","The Centre is readying a 23-point template for reforms and deregulation.

BENGALURU: Women remain significantly under-represented in India's venture capital (VC) industry, especially in decision-making roles, despite growing conversations about diversity and inclusion. An analysis of the investment teams at India’s most active VC firms, in terms of volume across years 2023 to 2025 so far, reveals how stark the gender gap remains.Among the 20 most active VC investors that TOI analysed, several firms have no women at all in their investment teams, including Z47 , Stellaris Venture Partners, and Nexus Venture Partners. Peak XV Partners has the highest absolute number of women investors, with 13 out of 44, while firms such as Blume Ventures (6 out of 23) and Accel India (5 out of 25) have relatively better representation. However, firms like Lightspeed Ventures (4 out of 16) and Elevation Capital (7 out of 33) still reflect the broader industry-wide challenge — women are outnumbered at nearly every major firm.This lack of diversity in VC teams has consequences beyond representation. “Peer networks play a huge role in hiring and decision-making in VC,” said Ankita Vashistha, founder and managing partner at Arise Ventures. “Most senior hiring is based on referral. Investment committees and general partners are predominantly male, and unconscious biases can shape whom they hire and fund. This has a direct impact on the startup ecosystem, as male-dominated VC firms are often less likely to back women-led startups.”Kanika Mayar, partner at Vertex Ventures, echoed this sentiment. “The problem isn’t just at the top. We need more women entering the investment space at all levels, so there is a strong pipeline for leadership roles. Firms need to be intentional about hiring and retaining women in VC. It’s not just about numbers — it’s about building an ecosystem that actively supports diverse perspectives.""According to PitchBook, in the US, women made up 18.4% of investment decision-makers at VC firms in 2023. In Europe, the situation is starker, with only 16% of investment partners being women.","Several firms have no women at all in their investment teams.

Historical data shows there’s a strong chance of the same happening in March.Past data going back a decade shows that excluding the Covid year of 2020, March is typically the best time for Indian equities, with Nifty 50 , Nifty midcap 100 and Nifty smallcap 100 indices posting average returns of 2.3%, 2.9%, and 2.6%, respectively, a report by Yes Securities showed.Another report by Samco Securities said that most of the bad news relating to the ongoing tariff wars between the US, China, Mexico, Canada and some other countries and blocks have already been priced in.The best Nifty return in March of any year in the past 10 years was 11% in 2016 and the worst was 4.5% in 2015. “Analyzing data from the last 10 years (excluding the Covid year), a clear revival trend emerges across key indices. Most sectoral indices also post positive returns, except Auto and IT, which typically remain flat,” the report by Yes Securities said. However, during the Jan-March quarter of every year, Indian indices typically underperform, the study warned.So far this year, the Nifty is down 5%, while the Nifty midcap 100 index is down 14% and the nifty smallcap 100 has lost 17.4%. On the BSE, the sensex has lost 5.3% so far in 2025. On Friday, Nifty closed at 22,553 points, while the sensex closed at 74,333 points.“While seasonality provides a strong directional cue, we do not rely on it blindly. Additional supporting factors strengthen the case for a turnaround,” the report said. Analysts at Yes Securities pointed out that market breadth , the ratio of the number of stocks that are closing higher to the ones closing lower, is of late improving across broader indices. They also said that financial stocks, one of the key sectors, is showing sustained strength.“Considering above mentioned rationale, ignoring the potential for a market rebound in March would be difficult. As history suggests, this seasonal tailwind, coupled with improving market dynamics, offers a compelling opportunity,” the report noted.Another report by Samco Securities also pointed out that tariff wars, between the US and some of its biggest trading partners, have already been priced in and it’s time to buy big.","Historical data shows there’s a strong chance of the same happening in March.

NEW DELHI: Japanese Nippon Paint is counting on India’s “youth dividend” as the company – with a business of $400 million in the country – looks to make fresh investments and up the hiring to expand its local operations as well as broaden export commitments .“There's such a youth dividend in India. A lot of countries are ageing, but India is still young. India is urbanizing. India's GDP is growing. So, there's so much to speak for India. We are here for the last nearly 20 years, (and) I'm sure there's a lot of headroom for growth,” Wee Siew Kim, Co-President of Nippon Paint Holdings and Group CEO, NIPSEA Group, told TOI. “The short answer is we are very positive on India.”Nippon Paints, which started operations in India in 2006, currently has four business divisions -- auto refinish; decorative; industrial; and automotive paints (JV with Berger). “All of them are growing, but also have different sets of challenges, especially the decorative space.”The company locally produces paints for its various divisions, and much of them are also exported. “Coil coating is exported together with our auto refinish .”The auto refinish division, led by Sharad Malhotra, is led globally out of India. “Which means that all the auto refinish business reports to Malhotra and he sets the direction for the group globally. So, it is an Indian team which is leading the division worldwide.”Kim said the same situation is there in the coil coating division which is targeted at the steel industry. “This is also exported to different parts of the world. Importantly, just like in auto refinish, the leader who leads coil coating in India also leads the global business. Globally, auto refinish is around $250-$270 million business, while coil coating is slightly smaller at about $180 million. If you add Japan, it's almost a $300-$400 million business for us. They are run by Indian leaders. These leaders run them and set the direction, whether it is the strategic business direction or important technology directions or product innovations.”He said the company is looking at not just organic growth, but also through acquisitions and buyouts. “Organic growth is where we grow the people, we invest in factories, and develop and make the products. Then there's the M&A growth. In the last two years, we have been fairly successful in acquiring local Indian companies where we not only bring the strength of the bigger Nippon Paint group, but also harness the value of these relatively-smaller companies. One such company has actually helped us get into the railways segment in India.”Kim said the company may also look at acquisitions in the auto refinished business as the division looks at expanding beyond its stronghold in the north. “So, if we could find partners or acquisitions in other parts of India, it will help us strengthen our pan-India presence.”On whether the company will look at funding its growth in India by raising money through an IPO, he said, “Well, I would say ‘never say never’. The Indian market is actually attractive and has very rich multiples. If you look at what some of the Indian counters are trading at, I mean they are far ahead of even the world benchmarks as far as paints and coatings are concerned. … if you ask me that would I be interested to consider raising funds in India? Well, at the right multiples, it’s worth considering.”Kim said Nippon Paint Holdings is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. “As far as our global approach to growth is concerned, we have actually articulated an asset assembler strategy. The asset assembler strategy drives us to take advantage of the lower cost of funding in Japan and using that to actually breathe life into our mission. The mission is to actually maximise shareholder value.”","Japanese Nippon Paint is counting on India’s “youth dividend” as the company – with a business of $400 million in the country – looks to make fresh investments. “There's such a youth dividend in India.

After a small recovery last week, the Indian equity market is brimming with anticipation as it looks to sustain its upward momentum. The Nifty 50 broke a three-week losing streak, closing nearly 2% higher despite global uncertainties, including the looming threat of trade wars. The rebound was fuelled by positive macroeconomic indicators , a drop in the dollar index, and liquidity support from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).As investors prepare for a shortened trading week due to the Holi festival holiday, several key factors could influence whether the Nifty 50 can break through the crucial 23,000 mark. With global market dynamics in play—from foreign institutional investor activity to crude oil prices and bond yields—next week could be pivotal for the index.Sectors such as metals, capital goods, and energy outperformed, supported by optimism around China's stimulus measures and lower crude oil prices. The fall in the dollar index also provided a boost to investor sentiment towards emerging markets, while US equity markets have been facing declines due to uncertainty surrounding Trump’s economic policies, according to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.This week is likely to be a truncated one as markets will remain closed on Friday for the Holi festival holiday. The shorter week could lead to increased volatility as traders adjust their positions ahead of the break, as per ET report. Investors will be keeping an eye on several key factors that may influence the direction of the market:Foreign investors have sold equities worth nearly Rs 25,000 crore so far in March, taking the total equity selling in 2025 to Rs 137,354 crore. There's also significant buying in Chinese stocks, driven by attractive valuations and expectations from recent positive government initiatives in China. The rally in Chinese stocks has propelled the Hang Seng Index to a YTD return of 23.48%, compared to the Nifty’s -5% return. However, experts, including VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, believe this is likely a short-term cyclical trade as Chinese corporate earnings have been disappointing for years.If foreign investors increase selling pressure, it could weigh on sentiment, but any inflows could continue the positive momentum seen last week.The recent decline in the dollar index to 104 is viewed as a positive sign for emerging markets like India. A weaker dollar typically supports risk assets and boosts foreign inflows into equities, making it an important factor for the Indian market in the coming week.US 10-year Treasury yields have dropped to 4.2%, providing relief to global equities. Lower bond yields reduce the appeal of fixed-income assets compared to stocks, which could encourage more risk-taking in equity markets.Brent crude oil prices hit a six-month low following OPEC+'s decision to increase production and persistent concerns about growth in the US. A decline in crude oil prices is beneficial for India, a major oil importer, as it helps curb inflation and improve corporate profit margins, especially for energy-intensive industries. Brent crude oil prices were down by 3.8% last week, marking their biggest weekly decline since November.Investors will be closely watching both domestic and global macroeconomic data. In India, the release of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data will provide insights into economic momentum. Moreover, developments related to US inflation, non-farm payroll data, and potential tariff changes could significantly influence global market sentiment.Technical analysts suggest that Nifty 50 could continue its pullback rally in the coming sessions. ""The zone of 22,670-22,700 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index, as it coincides with the 20-day EMA and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent downward move (23,807-21,965). If the index manages to stay above the 22,700 level, we may see the rally extend towards the 23,000 and 23,300 levels in the short term,"" said experts from SBI Securities. On the downside, the 22,300-22,250 range is expected to provide support in case of any decline.","The Nifty 50 broke a three-week losing streak, closing nearly 2% higher despite global uncertainties.

Realty giant DLF's rental arm, DLF Cyber City Developers Ltd (DCCDL), is set to invest approximately Rs 6,000 crore in the development of 75 lakh square feet of premium office and retail spaces in Gurugram. This move is aimed at capitalizing on the rising demand for high-quality, green commercial properties. DCCDL is a joint venture between DLF and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC, with DLF holding a 67% stake in the venture.In its latest investor presentation for the third quarter of the fiscal year, DLF revealed that DCCDL has begun construction on 5.5 million square feet of Grade A++ office spaces in the new phase of its high-end commercial project, 'DLF Downtown, Gurugram.'

""We will continue to provide exceptional customer experiences and remain the first choice for both international and Indian brands looking to expand in our locations,"" Khattar said.DCCDL's rental income from office and retail spaces rose by 10% to Rs 1,194 crore during the third quarter, driven by higher occupancy and increased rents. Office assets contributed Rs 962 crore to the rental income, reflecting a 10% rise from the previous year, while retail real estate income grew to Rs 231 crore from Rs 213 crore.DCCDL reported a 9% increase in revenue for the October-December period, rising from Rs 1,476 crore to Rs 1,609 crore.

NEW DELHI: Food and beverage giant PepsiCo is aiming to double its revenue in India over the next five years, placing the country as a major driver of its global growth.The company is making significant investments to expand its capacity, with India & South Asia CEO Jagrut Kotecha describing the market as a ""key anchor"" for the company.In an exclusive interview with news agency PTI, Kotecha said that India will be the “engine of growth for PepsiCo."" He also highlighted that the country is already among PepsiCo’s top three markets globally, with double-digit growth contributing to its expansion.To meet rising demand, PepsiCo also invested in new greenfield plants in Uttar Pradesh and Assam, with plans to open two more facilities, including one in southern India.We have plans to open up in other parts of the country as part of that. So, we are not going to be investment shy. We are going to be investing forward to drive that growth because it is there for us to capture the (market),"" he said.While India currently ranks among PepsiCo’s top 15 global markets, Kotecha expects it to move up the list, though he refrained from specifying a timeline. The company re-entered India in the 1990s after a 28-year gap, and today, it is considered one of PepsiCo’s 13 to 15 ""anchor markets"" worldwide, regions identified as key growth engines for the next five to seven years.PepsiCo aligns with the Indian government’s 2030 economic vision, Kotecha noted, describing India as ""one of the most stable economies and a growth engine."" He added, ""We have been investing for nearly 30 years, but now we need to accelerate that investment.""The company is operating under three strategic pillars, ""faster, stronger, better,"" and has divided India into nine clusters based on regional taste preferences. Sustainability is also a key focus, with efforts to implement environmentally friendly solutions and build local capabilities.Last month, PepsiCo reported double-digit organic revenue growth in India, with increased market share in both savoury snacks and beverages. While Kotecha did not commit to a specific timeline for reaching $2 billion (around Rs 17,000 crore) in revenue, he called it an ""aspiration"" that could be realised if infrastructure and market conditions align.In 2023, PepsiCo India recorded over Rs 8,200 crore in revenue over nine months due to a fiscal year change, and it has maintained strong double-digit growth since. The company has already invested Rs 3,500-4,000 crore in India over the past three years and is set to continue expanding. A new plant near Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, is operational, while another facility in Assam is expected to start by the end of the year.""Our investment strategy remains forward-looking. We see a tremendous opportunity and will continue investing to drive growth,"" Kotecha said.PepsiCo’s bottling partner, Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL), is also making significant investments.""I think they have close to 40-odd plants. They have just invested in capacities, increasing by 25 per cent this year. They are continuing that type of investment to grow with us. Our partnership is pretty strong to enable that growth. Both of us feel very good about this,"" Kotecha said, emphasising the strong partnership between the two companies.On the growing competition in the Indian beverage market, particularly from Reliance’s Campa Cola, Kotecha welcomed the rivalry, saying that competition helps expand the category.“Even before Pepsi and Coke were there, there were a lot of local, regional players,"" he said, ""Now Campa has also come with a lot of flair and expense and all. So our belief is the category will then grow and the consumption will grow.""He pointed out that India’s per capita beverage consumption remains low, even compared to neighbouring countries like Pakistan. ""Our focus is on understanding consumer needs and playing to our strengths,"" he said.PepsiCo’s beverage portfolio in India includes brands like Pepsi, 7UP, Mountain Dew, Sting, Gatorade, Tropicana, and Slice. Its snack segment features Kurkure, Lay’s, Quaker, and Doritos.In 2023, around 80 per cent of its revenue came from the food segment, while beverages contributed the remaining 20 per cent, largely managed by VBL.The Indian beverage market, currently valued at $12 billion, is growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10-11 per cent. With ongoing investments and increasing consumer demand, PepsiCo is well-positioned to capitalise on this expanding market.","PepsiCo is aiming to double its revenue in India over the next five years.

"Ragging horror in Gujarat: MBBS interns assaulted, forced into ‘murga position’ over Instagram post",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/6-mbbs-doctors-booked-for-ragging-3-interns-at-bhavnagar-med-college/articleshow/118809628.cms,"Victims forced into murga position in doctor’s room

RAJKOT: A shocking case of ragging surfaced at Government Medical College, Bhavnagar, where six MBBS doctors allegedly kidnapped, assaulted, and ill-treated three fellow interns, reportedly offended by an Instagram post created by one of them.Nilambaug police in Bhavnagar registered two separate FIRs Saturday night, charging the six with kidnapping, wrongful confinement, causing hurt, intimidation, and using obscene language.In response, the college's anti-ragging committee held an urgent meeting Saturday and suspended four of the six accused. College authorities confirmed that four of the six accused and the victims were completing Compulsory Rotating Medical Internship at Sir T Hospital, affiliated with the medical college, after completing MBBS. The three victims were living in the college's boys' hostel. Two accused had finished the internship.According to the complaint filed by one of the victims, they created an Instagram page titled ‘Convocation Speaks' meant for humorous content. However, the accused took offence to the posts and allegedly targeted the interns in retaliation.On the night of March 6, the complainant received a call from one of the accused, asking him to meet. Upon arrival, he was forced into a car, where another doctor was already present with a driver, called ‘JD'.As they drove towards Jewel Circle, one of the accused began assaulting the two victims inside the car. They were then taken to a street opposite a hotel, where the rest of the accused were waiting.The group allegedly repeatedly beat up the victims, abused them and accused them of tarnishing the college’s reputation. The complainant was then forced to unlock his phone, and the accused took images from his gallery, threatening to circulate them online. The nature of the images remains unclear.The victims were then taken to the hostel room of another doctor, where they were allegedly forced into the degrading ‘murga position’ — where one squats with their arms passing under their knees and holds their ears. Additionally, a separate complaint was filed by a hostel resident doctor, stating that two of the accused barged into his room at around 2am while he was asleep and assaulted him repeatedly.The three victims were treated at Sir T Hospital before lodging a formal complaint with the medical college dean. They later approached the police to file a case. Speaking to reporters, college dean Sushil Jha confirmed that the incident was a clear case of ragging, prompting an immediate meeting of the 11-member anti-ragging committee.“We suspended four interns with immediate effect and withheld their internship certificates. We will convene another meeting soon to decide the further course of action,” Jha said.","Six MBBS doctors allegedly kidnapped, assaulted, and ill-treated three fellow interns.

Consumer prices fell in China in February for the first time in 13 months, as persistent weak demand was compounded by the early timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.The National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday that the consumer price index dropped 0.7% in February compared with a year ago. On a monthly basis, prices were down 0.2% from January.While many other countries wrestle with inflation, China's policymakers face flat to falling prices, and the possibility they could evolve into a deflationary spiral that would drag down the economy. The government stressed the need to increase domestic demand and consumer spending in an annual report last week to its ceremonial legislature, the National People's Congress, but held back on unveiling any dramatic new steps to boost the economy.The Lunar New Year, a time when spending rises for travel, dining out and entertainment, came in late January this year instead of February, as it's based on the cycles of the moon. Holiday spending helped drive the consumer price index up 0.5% in January, but it then fell last month compared with 2024's elevated level.Factoring out the impact of the holiday, the index rose 0.1% last month, Dong Lijuan, a statistician at the government's statistics bureau, said in a written analysis.That is still far lower than ideal. Last week's government annual report included an inflation target of 2% for this year, but it is likely to fall far short of that goal. The consumer price index was flat in 2024, rising 0.2%.Besides the early Lunar New Year, two other factors contributed to falling prices in February, Dong said: Better weather boosted farm production, driving down the price of fresh vegetables and automakers also stepped up promotions to try to boost sales, reducing prices for new cars.The producer price index, which measures the wholesale price of goods, fell 2.2% in February, the statistics bureau said. Producer prices have been falling more sharply than consumer prices, putting pressure on companies to cut labor and other costs.The falling prices are a symptom of both weak consumer spending and a massive expansion of factories to build electric vehicles, solar panels and other green-energy products, encouraged by government subsidies.A burgeoning trade war with the United States could add to China's economic challenges, which include a prolonged real estate market crisis that is weighing on consumer confidence.Government ministers, speaking to journalists at the National People's Congress on Sunday, pledged continued efforts to stabilize the real estate market and said that expanding employment in the current economic environment would be ""a heavy task.""The employment situation is showing signs of improvement but the foundation for economic recovery remains unstable, said Wang Xiaoping, the minister of human resources and social security.""The pressure on total employment remains unchanged,"" she said, noting that people are facing difficulties finding work and raising their incomes.For real estate, a portion of this year's 4.4 trillion yuan ($600 billion) in special local government bonds would go toward purchasing completed but unsold housing projects and converting them to affordable housing, apartments for young people, staff dormitories and other uses, said Ni Hong, the minister of housing and urban-rural development.The government will also expand a program to rehabilitate older housing including adding all compounds built before 2000 to its urban renovation scheme, he said.","Consumer prices fell in China in February for the first time in 13 months. The consumer price index dropped 0.7% in February compared with a year ago.

Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats have added volatility to global stock markets, with India emerging as a key player in the US president’s trade realignment strategy.India put a 9.5% tariff on US goods, while the US imposes just 3% on Indian products. As reciprocal tariffs loom, industries like automobiles, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and steel are at risk. Despite a short rally this week, the Nifty remains down 14% from its peak, with smallcaps in bear market territory. Over $15 billion has been pulled out by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in 2025 alone.Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have maintained their selling trend in Indian equities this March, with total equity outflows reaching Rs 24,753 crore as of March 7, bringing the year-to-date total to Rs 1,37,354 crore in CY25, according to ET report.India is particularly vulnerable to tariff hikes, with key sectors facing significant threats. The Indian Rupee has weakened, and foreign investment is retreating due to concerns about a slowdown.Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets said that India’s automobile, pharmaceutical, textiles, and steel sectors could face severe impacts. However, India’s diplomatic approach—focused on trade negotiations and tariff rationalization—could help mitigate risks. YES Securities suggests reducing tariffs on US imports like steel and encouraging American companies like Tesla to enter India, which could serve as leverage against potential retaliatory tariffs.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, explains that markets perceive Trump’s moves as temporary negotiations rather than long-term tariff impositions, acknowledging that sustained tariffs could hurt the US economy. In response, China and Germany have already implemented domestic stimulus measures to counterbalance the effects of Trump’s policies, adding another layer of complexity to the global economic landscapeThe pharmaceutical sector, which holds 35% of the US market, faces short-term challenges but may benefit in the long term due to India’s competitive advantage over China. Amisha Vora, Chairperson & MD of PL Group, emphasized that despite tariff concerns, India remains more competitive than China, which faces a 20% tariff. Sandip Sabharwal, a market expert, pointed out that large-cap pharma stocks like Sun Pharma and Lupin have already experienced sell-offs but remain well-positioned unless tariffs escalate significantly.Despite global uncertainties, Indian markets show resilience. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, noted that India’s markets have remained strong despite equity outflows from emerging markets.Amisha Vora sees the current dip as an investment opportunity. “With ongoing reforms and India’s demographic advantage, the market will likely perform better, even amidst trade wars,” Vora told ET suggesting a potential correction of 4-5% in the short term.","Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats have added volatility to global stock markets.

What they’re saying

The buyer’s remorse is playing out at a volatile moment for Tesla, as stocks dropped by double digits in the past week, wiping out most of a postelection surge for Musk’s company. A recent report showed plummeting sales in Europe, and the company faces increased competition from other EV makers eating away at its market share. Recent protests outside Tesla showrooms in the United States and some notable cases of vehicle owners being harassed have also made headlines.

An article in the New York Times titled 'Tesla for Sale: Buyer’s Remorse Sinks In for Elon Musk’s EV-Owning Critics'",The Tesla Model S has been in the news for the wrong reasons. The electric car maker has been accused of overcharging customers. The company has also been hit by a series of high-profile incidents involving the car.

UK finance minister calls for reform in welfare system to address high inflation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-finance-minister-calls-for-reform-in-welfare-system-to-address-high-inflation/articleshow/118784902.cms,"UK Finance Minister, Rachel Reeves (File Photo- AFP)

Britain's finance minister, Rachel Reeves , has called for urgent reforms to the country's welfare system, citing concerns that it is ""costing too much"" as the nation grapples with high inflation and rising borrowing.Reeves is expected to announce significant cuts to welfare spending in her upcoming Spring Statement on March 26, following her inaugural budget in October.The government's fiscal position has been further strained by global challenges, including US tariffs and the ongoing war in Ukraine, leading to a depletion of the Labour administration's £9.9 billion ($12.7 billion) financial cushion, news agency AFP reported.In an interview on Sky News' Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Reeves said, ""We have to reform our welfare system because, right now, it's letting down taxpayers. It's costing too much and isn't effectively helping those it should.""She emphasized the need for a system that does more than provide benefits, aiming instead to support people back into employment. ""We need to get better value for money from taxpayers' contributions,"" she added.Any reforms could potentially conflict with the finance minister's self-imposed fiscal rules, which prevent borrowing for day-to-day spending. These rules are meant to maintain the credibility of the government's fiscal policies in financial markets.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to increase UK defence spending to 2.5% of the national economy by 2027, a commitment spurred by growing concerns over the US's stance on Ukraine and NATO.","Britain's finance minister, Rachel Reeves, has called for urgent reforms to the country's welfare system.

Walgreens Boots Alliance has been acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal worth nearly $10 billion, as the retailer seeks to turn around its fortunes after years of financial difficulties but still couldn't do it.Announcing the deal on Thursday, the pharmacy company said Sycamore would pay $11.45 per share, with the potential for shareholders to receive an additional $3 per share under certain conditions. The agreement would take the company private, allowing it to restructure its business away from the pressures of Wall Street. Tim Wentworth, Walgreens Boots Alliance CEO said, “Throughout our history, Walgreens Boots Alliance has played a critical role in the retail healthcare ecosystem. We are focused on making healthcare delivery more effective, convenient and affordable as we navigate the challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape.""The CEO further added that Sycamore will provide the company with the expertise and experience of a partner with a strong track record of successful retail turnarounds.The buyout deal values Walgreens at almost $24 billion when including debt, and Sycamore’s offer represents a nearly 30 per cent premium on its share price from December, when reports of a possible sale first surfaced.Walgreens has also been working to boost its finances, including suspending its quarterly dividend, ending a 90-year streak, and reducing its stake in drug distributor Cencora to free up cash for debt repayment.Ultimately, improving cash flow remains a top priority, whether the company stays public or goes private. ""Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan,"" Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny noted in a February report.Founded in 1901, Walgreens has been a public company since 1927 but has faced growing challenges in recent years, due to low prescription reimbursement rates, rising costs, increasing theft, and price-sensitive customers shifting to cheaper alternatives. The company already began a restructuring process, including plans to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 US stores. This follows a previous downsizing, which saw it reduce its store count after acquiring parts of Rite Aid in 2018.Beyond store closures, Walgreens has been reviewing its US healthcare operations, including a potential sale of its VillageMD clinic business, which it had aggressively expanded. This move comes after the company’s shares lost nearly two-thirds of their value in 2023.Walgreens operates nearly 3,700 international stores in the UK, Mexico, Thailand, and Ireland. The buyout comes at a time of major shifts in the industry, with rival Rite Aid recently emerging from bankruptcy as a private company, while competitors like CVS, Walmart, and Kroger continue to dominate the US pharmacy market.","Walgreens Boots Alliance has been acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal worth nearly $10 billion.

The US market, which was already on the edge over US tariffs and economic uncertainty, suffered massive lows as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 427 points (1 per cent) to 42,579.08, while the Nasdaq fell 483.48 points to 18,069.26, 2.6 per cent down at the end of the day.The S&P 500 index slid 1.8 per cent or 104.11 points to 5,738.52, resuming its recent downturn after a brief recovery spell the previous day.Stocks kept falling despite US President Donald Trump's decision to delay the 25 per cent tariff on Mexican, Canadian and Chinese imports for one month. Investors found little relief, though concerns persisted over whether Trump is using tariffs as a negotiation strategy or if an extended trade war is unavoidable.Despite hopes for a softer stance, Trump is still pressing ahead with additional tariffs set to take effect on 2nd April. The constant back-and-forth tariff imposition has also fuelled the market uncertainty as earlier.Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management said, “These exemptions don’t do much to resolve the general air of uncertainty.” He further added that businesses will continue to opt for a cautious stance in the current scenario until the tariff picture is clear.US firms are already struggling with the instability, while consumers brace for rising prices.All eyes are now on the US jobs report, a key indicator of economic health. So far, strong hiring and consumer spending have helped prevent a recession, and economists expected hiring to ramp up in February.However, some major retailers are flashing warning signs. Macy’s reported lower-than-expected revenue for the end of 2024, despite profits beating forecasts. It also issued a weaker profit outlook for 2025, sending its shares down 0.7 per cent.Victoria’s Secret followed a similar path, beating Q4 estimates but forecasting disappointing revenue for the year ahead, which caused its stock to plunge 8.2 per cent.Some of Wall Street's biggest tech firms are also falling.Chipmakers, which soared in recent years due to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, also took a heavy hit. Marvell Technology fell almost 20 per cent despite recording better-than-expected earnings and predicting over 60 per cent revenue growth this quarter. Even Nvidia, the face of the AI revolution, fell 5.7 per cent, while Broadcom slid 6.3 per cent ahead of its earnings release.These firms are also facing increasing competition with Chinese companies ramping up their own AI development.European markets showed mixed results after the European Central Bank cut interest rates as expected. Germany’s DAX rose 1.5 per cent, while shares across Asia also gained, including a 3.3 per cent jump in Hong Kong and a 1.2 per cent rise in Shanghai.In the bond market, the 10-year US Treasury yield edged up slightly to 4.29 per cent from 4.28 per cent on Wednesday.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 427 points (1 per cent) to 42,579.08.

MUMBAI: The US dollar may have run out of steam, with weaker economic data resulting in a decline in the dollar index. More weakness may be forthcoming as the announced tariffs will push up prices, reduce spending, and hit growth in the US.""The reversal of the dollar index in the last two-three weeks has been in parallel with the weakened data that has been coming up. When weaker data comes up, the view of what the Fed might do changes towards a more easing bias which in turn leads to less of a pressure on foreign exchange,"" said Satyam Panday, chief economist US & Canada at S&P. He was speaking at Crisil's India outlook event.According to Panday, the US outperformance narrative is probably not going to hold this year, going by the impact of tariffs. ""Without getting into the issue of reciprocal tariffs, the tariffs that have already been implemented - Canada, Mexico and the Chinese tariffs, back of the envelope calculation indicate a 60-70-basis-point price rise impact on the basket. If you look at the marginal propensity to consume you would probably see a 20-30 basis points impact on consumer spending .""According to D K Joshi, chief economist at Crisil, every time the rupee has fallen sharply from its trend rate of depreciation, it has been followed by an appreciation or a long period of stability.""Our forecast of the rupee-dollar exchange rate for March 2025 was at 87 and for March 2026, it was mild depreciation leading up to 88. I between I think there will be volatility but beyond that, this is our projection,"" said Joshi. ""We are going through the volatile phase right now, where you'll see ups and downs in currency. But if it depreciates too much it will also appreciate.""According to Joshi, the outflow of capital now has nothing to do with the interest rate differential but with uncertainty, because of which money was going back to its home market.","The US dollar may have run out of steam, with weaker economic data resulting in a decline in the dollar index.

NEW DELHI: Ironic as it may sound, but while US President Donald Trump pushes for lower import duty on Tesla cars and the iconic Harley-Davidson motorcycles when they come in to India, but neither of the two companies currently source them from America and rather prefer to get them from factories in other countries.While Harley is importing its bikes from its mega manufacturing set-up in Thailand, Tesla – which is close to launching its cars in India – will also not be shipping the electrics from the US, but rather from its factory in Germany (India has requested the company not to import from China).This, industry officials say, clearly brings out the fact that while there is noise and complaints from the new US administration regarding high duties on autos in India, American companies do not see the need to import fully-built products, or even semi- or completely-knocked down kits, from the US.Companies find it better and beneficial to use other manufacturing countries due to locational advantages (that saves freight as well as time when importing to India) or because of economies of scale.For example, look at the business case of Harley-Davidson motorcycles even after the govt decided to cut duty on imported bikes in the just-announced Union Budget. The Budget had slashed the customs duty on fully-built bikes bigger than 1600cc from 50% to 30%, while for SKD (semi-knocked down) kits, it came down from 25% to 20% and for CKD (completely-knocked down) from 15% to 10%. And for bikes with engines smaller than 1600cc, the customs duty was reduced from 50% to 40% for fully-built ones, while on SKDs from 25% to 20%, and on CKDs from 15% to 10%.Despite this, Harley – which makes only the 440cc model (called X440) in India in partnership with Hero Moto -- prefers to get the other models them from Thailand, instead of using its US factories. “There is a mega set-up in Thailand that the company uses to get its bikes to India. Beyond the 440cc that it makes here, all the other bikes – including bigger ones like Pan America, Nightster, Street Glide and Fat Bob -- are being imported from Thailand,” an analyst specializing in foreign trade told TOI.Interestingly, Harley imports its bikes to India at zero duty due to trade agreements between the two countries. “So even if India reduces the duty on imported bikes from the US to zero, Harley will still find it beneficial to get them from Thailand. This is because Thailand is closer to India and so the freight cost will be lower and products can reach faster,” another analyst said.","US President Donald Trump pushes for lower import duty on Tesla cars and the iconic Harley-Davidson motorcycles.

"European central bank cuts interest rates amid looming trade war, growth concern",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/european-central-bank-cuts-interest-rates-amid-looming-trade-war-growth-concern/articleshow/118765117.cms,"European Central Bank (Photo-AP)

The European central bank (ECB) reduced interest rates by 25 basis point on Thursday, aiming to stimulate economic activity as the eurozone grapples with sluggish growth.This move, which lowers borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, comes amid mounting concerns about the impact of potential trade conflicts with the US and rising defence spending.The ECB’s decision to cut its benchmark deposit rate to 2.5% is aimed at supporting the economy by making it cheaper to borrow for investment and consumption. The bank previously raised rates to a record 4% in response to inflation peaking at 10.6% in October 2022, but has been easing rates since June as inflation has since moderated to 2.4%, according to AP report.Despite the decline in inflation, growth remains a pressing concern for the 20 nations using the euro. The eurozone’s economy showed zero growth in the final quarter of 2024, and the outlook for 2025 is uncertain due to shifting dynamics in global trade and the possibility of heightened defence spending.ECB President Christine Lagarde , speaking after the meeting, emphasized that the rate cut would make borrowing conditions “meaningfully less restrictive” for the economy.She cautioned that the central bank was not committing to a specific rate trajectory going forward, acknowledging the complexities presented by global trade tensions and increased government spending.As economic uncertainty continues, Lagarde noted that increased defence and infrastructure spending could spur growth, but growing global trade tensions—particularly with the US—pose a major challenge to inflation expectations in the eurozone.Economists, including Carsten Brzeski from ING Bank, pointed out that with increasing uncertainty and the possibility of large fiscal stimulus, the ECB’s future rate path is unclear. ""A pause at the next meeting to reassess the economic landscape seems likely,"" said Brzeski.The new fiscal realities in Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy, have added another layer of complexity. A new government coalition has agreed to loosen budget restrictions to allow for significantly more borrowing, potentially injecting up to a trillion euros into defence and other sectors over the next decade. This shift in fiscal policy could stimulate growth, but may also lead to increased inflationary pressures.Meanwhile, concerns are rising about US President Trump's potential new tariffs on European goods, which could further hinder growth in the export-driven eurozone economy . The looming trade war adds another layer of uncertainty for businesses already wary of inflation and political shifts.Despite these challenges, some analysts, like Julien Lafargue of Barclays Private Bank, expect the ECB to remain flexible, making future decisions based on incoming economic data. The central bank faces a delicate balancing act: boosting growth while managing inflationary risks, with external pressures such as US tariffs potentially complicating this task.","ECB reduced interest rates by 25 basis point on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: More than 1.14 lakh startups in India have created over 12 lakh jobs so far, the finance ministry said in its latest review of the Indian economy .In the report titled, ‘The Indian Economy: A Review January 2024’, the Department of Economic Affairs said that the 1.14 lakh startups recognised by the government under the 'Startup India initiative’ created more than 12 lakh jobs (as of October 2023).The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023, the document read.Despite facing global challenges in 2023 like valuation issues, few IPOs, regulatory changes and macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, India remains the third largest tech start-up ecosystem globally, with over 950 tech startups founded last year.The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023), according to a recent report by Nasscom in collaboration with Zinnov.“In 2023, despite facing global economic and regulatory challenges, Indian tech startups have prioritised the imperative of enhancing their business fundamentals, driving profitability and growth,” said Debjani Ghosh, President, Nasscom.“The proliferation of tech startups in tier 2 and 3 cities marks the ecosystem's resilience,” she added.Navigating 2024, tech startup founders expect to continue the revenue growth path with measured steps focusing on optimising expenditure and maximising profitability for B2B tech startups.Investments in deeptech will continue an upward trend in 2024. With generative AI (GenAI) acceleration, 70 per cent of start-up founders are embedding artificial intelligence (AI) in their solutions.As funding becomes scarce for the Indian startup ecosystem in general, the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given a new lease of life to entrepreneurs and founders in the country, as the Centre extends support to the sector.","The state-owned e-commerce platform Open Network for Digital Commerce clocked more than 63 lakh transactions till November 2023.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September.

That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

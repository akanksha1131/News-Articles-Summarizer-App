GST revamp: Goods and services tax not applicable on these post-sale discounts; here is what experts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-revamp-goods-and-services-tax-not-applicable-on-these-post-sale-discounts-here-is-what-experts-say/articleshow/123872817.cms,"Goyal Hails GST Reforms, Assures Industry Will Pass Benefits To Consumers, Says US Trade Talks On





The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) clarified that post-sale discounts offered by manufacturers to dealers, aimed purely at competitive pricing and driving sales, will not attract Goods and Services Tax GST ).In a circular, the board further explained that GST would, however, apply if such discounts are linked to specific promotional services carried out by dealers on behalf of the manufacturer, such as co-branding initiatives, advertising campaigns or customised sales drives.The clarification follows multiple representations received by the CBIC on the treatment of secondary or post-sale discounts under GST, PTI reported.According to the circular, dealers may sometimes engage in promotional efforts after receiving discounts, but these actions usually help them sell the goods they own and, in turn, increase their own earnings. In such situations, the board said, the discount functions only as a reduction in the sale price of goods rather than as consideration for a separate service.""Therefore, it is clarified that post-sale discounts offered by manufacturers to dealers in such cases shall not be treated as consideration for a separate transaction of supply of services,"" the CBIC circular stated.The tax will only apply, the board noted, if agreements explicitly state that dealers will perform promotional services like exhibitions, customised campaigns, advertising or customer support, with a defined payment for such activities.Commenting on the circular, AMRG & Associates senior partner Rajat Mohan pointed out that while dealers often run small marketing campaigns or quick sales drives, such efforts are usually undertaken to boost their own sales volumes.""The government has rightly clarified that these routine trade discounts cannot be treated as payment for any service provided by the dealer to the manufacturer, and therefore no additional GST liability arises in such cases,"" Mohan was quoted as saying by PTI.EY tax partner Saurabh Agarwal said the clarification rightly differentiates between a straightforward trade discount and a service transaction. He added that the position confirms that where the manufacturer-dealer relationship is on a principal-to-principal basis, discounts meant purely for sales promotion or competitive pricing cannot be viewed as payment for services.He also stressed that this move addresses a major source of confusion. ""In light of these clarifications, businesses must revisit their contractual arrangements and tax positions. The government's clear demarcation between trade discounts and promotional services will significantly reduce interpretational disputes and provide greater certainty in compliance for the industry, paving the way for a more streamlined GST regime,"" Agarwal told PTI.Grant Thornton Bharat partner Manoj Mishra noted that the CBIC’s guidance resolves a long-standing dispute. He highlighted that the assurance on input tax credit, which remains unaffected when financial or commercial credit notes are issued, eliminates a significant compliance risk for dealers.""From a practical standpoint, this puts the onus on businesses to carefully document agreements, credit notes, and customer-level pricing arrangements.”""Overall, the clarification is a pragmatic move that strengthens certainty, reduces litigation, and provides a workable framework for industry,"" Mishra said.","The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) clarified that post-sale discounts offered by manufacturers to dealers, aimed purely at competitive pricing, will not attract GST.

Delhi's Bhai Dooj gift: Pink Card registration to begin from mid October; free bus travel for women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/delhis-bhai-dooj-gift-pink-card-registration-to-begin-from-mid-october-free-bus-travel-for-women/articleshow/123869615.cms,"



The Delhi government is set to launch the registration process for its Pink Card, a lifetime free bus travel pass for women, from mid-October, as a Bhai Dooj gift to the women of the national capital.According to a senior transport department official, the Pink Card will be valid for a lifetime and aims to make public transport easier and more accessible. The initiative will replace the existing paper-based ticket system with the ‘Saheli Smart Card’, described as a permanent and personalised pass designed to provide women with unrestricted and secure travel on government-run buses.He said registration for the card is expected to begin in October, allowing “Delhi's daughters and sisters to avail unlimited free travel as a token of the government's commitment towards their welfare.” The exact launch date and procedure will be finalised in a meeting scheduled for the coming week.The card will also enhance safety and reduce inconvenience by eliminating the need for daily paper tickets, offering instead a hassle-free smart card.Plans for the Saheli Smart Card were first outlined in July. At the time, officials confirmed that it would carry the holder’s name and photograph and would be available to women and transgender residents of Delhi aged 12 years and above.The card, issued under the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) framework, will allow free travel on all DTC and Cluster buses and can also be recharged and used across other transit services.“To obtain the card, applicants must be bona fide residents of Delhi, aged 12 years or above, and have valid proof of address. They must register online through the DTC portal, select a participating bank, and complete full KYC verification at the chosen bank branch,” the official told PTI.The list of required documents includes Aadhaar, PAN, proof of residence in Delhi, a passport-size photograph, and any additional paperwork specified under the bank’s KYC norms. Once the KYC process is completed, the issuing bank will dispatch the card directly to the applicant’s registered address.The Delhi government has invited Expressions of Interest (EoI) from banks and financial institutions to support the card’s roll-out. Officials clarified that while the government will not charge users for the free travel scheme, banks may impose a small fee for issuing or maintaining the card. In the event of loss, the cardholder must inform the issuing bank, which may replace it under its own policies.Before it can be used, the card must be activated through the Automatic Fare Collection System (AFCS) of DTC. While topping up will enable use across other public transport services, the free travel facility will apply only to DTC and Cluster buses.“No card will be issued directly by DTC. Registration is completely online through the DTC portal, and cards are issued only after full KYC verification by the selected bank,” the official added.The chief minister has previously criticised the old pink ticket system, introduced under the AAP government, arguing that it was prone to corruption.","The Delhi government is set to launch the registration process for its Pink Card, a lifetime free bus travel pass for women, from mid-October.

Chinese auto market: Govt unveils plan to 'stabilise' sector; emphasis on 'cost surveys and price monitoring',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-auto-market-govt-unveils-plan-to-stabilise-sector-emphasis-on-cost-surveys-and-price-monitoring/articleshow/123871975.cms,"



China rolled out a two-year plan aimed at easing turbulence in its car industry, where aggressive price cuts and trade disputes have weighed heavily on growth.State news agency Xinhua said the programme, covering 2025 and 2026, was issued jointly by eight government departments. It places emphasis on “cost surveys and price monitoring” while urging carmakers to step up innovation and stimulate home demand.The sector is expected to see sales of about 32.3 million vehicles this year, a rise of 3%. That is slower than the 4.5% expansion recorded in 2024, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.Beijing has funnelled significant funds into the electric vehicle sector, hoping to position the country as a global leader. The new plan sets an ambitious target of 15.5 million new energy vehicles to be sold in 2025, representing 20% year-on-year growth.Yet the industry is under pressure from a cut-throat price war. Cheap models and trade-in deals have flooded the market, pushing many smaller firms out of business. At a meeting in July, officials urged carmakers to abandon “irrational competition” in favour of healthy development.China’s drive to export more vehicles is also meeting resistance. The EU launched a probe in 2023 into possible unfair competition in the sector, and this week Mexico announced plans to hike tariffs on Chinese car imports to 50% from the current 15–20%, a decision that sparked an angry response from Beijing.","State news agency Xinhua said the programme, covering 2025 and 2026, was issued jointly by eight government departments.

China gold licences: Yellow metal’s largest buyer to ease rules; continues to diversify away from dollar reserves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/china-gold-licences-yellow-metals-largest-buyer-to-ease-rules-continues-to-diversify-away-from-dollar-reserves/articleshow/123871235.cms,"



China, the world's largest consumer of gold, is planning to relax licensing norms for the export and import of the yellow metal, as the nation continues to steer away its reserves from the US dollar.According to a draft proposal from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the country plans to expand the use of “multi-use permits,” a quicker approval system, by increasing the number of ports authorised to accept them.The central bank also intends to extend its validity to nine months and remove limitations on how the number of times each permit can be used, Bloomberg reported.The latest step comes on the back of PBOC’s 2016 initiative, which aimed to streamline cross-border gold trade by cutting down paperwork and speeding up imports.China’s central bank has been steadily boosting its gold reserves, extending its buying spree for a 10th consecutive month in August. Domestic demand for investment bars and coins has also stayed strong.According to Bloomberg, gold prices have climbed nearly 40 per cent this year, fuelled by central-bank purchases, heightened geopolitical tensions, and expectations of US interest rate cuts.The PBOC said the relaxation of permit rules would “enhance vitality and respond to external shocks by improving the business environment at ports.”The proposal is open for public feedback until October 13.","China to relax licensing norms for export and import of the yellow metal.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Stock market recommendations:The benchmark index Nifty has ended the week on a positive note for the second straight session, reinforcing the momentum of the ongoing recovery. Over the last two weeks, the index has staged a gradual rebound of nearly 700 points, registering its highest weekly close in eight weeks—a clear indication of improving sentiment and technical strength.On the daily chart, Nifty is currently approaching a breakout from a Symmetrical Triangle pattern, a formation that typically precedes a sharp directional move. The index is trading above both its short-term and long-term moving averages, which are now beginning to slope upwards—signalling a strengthening trend and increasing bullish bias.Momentum indicators are also turning favourable. The daily RSI has moved past the 60 mark for the first time since July 2025, reflecting growing strength in the underlying trend. Additionally, the MACD remains in buy mode, and the rising histogram suggests a pickup in upside momentum.Market breadth has shown notable improvement in recent sessions. Among Nifty constituents, 82% of stocks are trading above their 20-day EMA, while 76% are above their 50-day EMA—indicating broad-based participation in the rally.From a level’s perspective, the 25150–25200 zone will act as a key resistance for the index. A decisive move above 25200 could trigger a sharp rally toward 25500, followed by 25700 in the short term. On the downside, the 24950–24900 zone is expected to offer support in case of any immediate pullback.The banking benchmark index has extended its pullback rally for the second straight week, signalling a short-term recovery attempt following recent declines. From the recent low of 53561, the index has bounced back by over 1200 points, reflecting a gradual improvement in market sentiment.Despite this rebound, the index continues to trade below its 50-day and 100-day EMA—indicating that the broader trend has yet to confirm a reversal. These moving averages remain key resistance zones, and a decisive close above them will be essential to validate a sustained uptrend.On the momentum front, the daily RSI remains in a sideways phase, though it is gradually inching higher. This slow upward movement suggests a subtle build-up in strength, and a breakout above the 60 mark could further reinforce bullish momentum.Looking ahead, the 55100–55200 zone will act as an immediate resistance for the index. A sustainable move above 55200 could pave the way for an extended rally toward 56000 in the near term. On the downside, the 54400–54300 zone is expected to offer crucial support in case of any short-term pullback.The stock has recently witnessed a breakout from a Falling Wedge pattern on the daily chart, accompanied by strong volume activity, which adds conviction to the move. Post-breakout, it has also moved above its short-term and long-term moving averages, both of which are now trending higher—a bullish signal.The RSI has climbed above 60 for the first time since 30th May, indicating strengthening momentum. Additionally, the DI+ has crossed above DI- on the ADX indicator, suggesting an improvement in trend strength. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of ₹2925–₹2935 level with a stoploss at ₹2840. On the upside, the stock is likely to test ₹3140 in the short term.On Friday, the stock gave a horizontal trendline breakout on the daily chart, supported by a notable surge in volumes, which were higher than the previous six sessions. A large bullish candle formed on the breakout day further reinforces the strength of the move. The RSI is in bullish territory and rising, while the ADX line is also trending upward, indicating a strong underlying trend.Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of ₹2080–₹2090 level with a stoploss at ₹2020. The stock has the potential to rally towards ₹2230 in the near term.","Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, says top stock picks for this week are Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd, and Bajaj Finserv.

NEW DELHI: Inflation has largely remained benign across states and overall, but Kerala continues to top the charts with the highest retail inflation rate in Aug. Rising gold and coconut oil prices are seen to be the reason behind the spurt. Latest data from the National Statistics Office (NSO) showed Kerala had the highest inflation rate among 22 states and Union territories for which numbers were released. It topped the table with a rate of over 9%, while Karnataka and Jammu and Kashmir were a distant second with 3.8% and flood-affected Punjab recorded 3.5%.""The Kerala case is clearly the most interesting outlier. The rural-urban breakup of inflation in the state shows that the rural inflation is at 10.1% and the urban inflation at 7.2%,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at SBI.He said the driving factor is the oils and fats component, which is common for the entire combined consumer price index, and adds that in case of Kerala the steep rise in coconut oil prices has driven the trend and local preference has dominated index momentum coupled with impact of changing climate on coconut production, which is absorbed within the state. ""Another factor is the weight of personal care in CPI for Kerala is higher than other states, which includes gold prices that have also contributed to the build-up in state level CPI in Kerala,"" said Ghosh.",Latest data from the National Statistics Office showed Kerala had the highest inflation rate among 22 states and Union territories.

Burgers to beauty: Brands ride Korean wave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/burgers-to-beauty-brands-ride-korean-wave/articleshow/123887535.cms,"



Indian Gen Zs are crazy about everything Korean - the trend is not new, but what makes it interesting is that it has sustained in the digital age of fast-changing fads. It started with BTS and 'Crash Landing on You' and then swept the food, fashion and beauty spaces. The trend picked up during the pandemic - confined to their homes, more people explored global content. Now, it is slowly becoming broad-based; consumers from other cohorts are also catching up with 'Hallyu' - the Korean wave - and companies are tapping into this trend to get more shoppers.""Culturally, there are many similarities (between the two countries) which is why K-brands are welcomed by Indian people. Also, Gen Z and Gen Alpha consumers are open to accepting new concepts,"" said Paul Lee, managing director & country head at Korean beauty brand Amorepacific's India unit.Brands try to catch the Gen Zs young. And there's good reason to do that - at 377 million, Gen Zs (born between 1997-2012) make up India's biggest consumer cohort. Many of them are also joining the workforce now, which means their ability to spend will grow. For Reliance's Tira, K-beauty has played a ""catalytic"" role in engaging the Gen Z audience, said a company spokesperson. ""...they are not only early adopters but also trend diffusers for other age groups,"" the firm said.Korean trends aren't just passing through, they are embedding themselves into everyday lives and shaping choices across industries, said Aparna Bhawal, CMO at KFC India & partner countries, which is building a Korean flavour profile. It has helped the brand drive trials among young consumers. ""With K-dramas and music just a click away, Korean culture is now both accessible and relatable. This influence rubs off on food choices too, "" Bhawal said. Initially driven by Gen Z and younger audience, the Korean food interest is now cascading across broader demographic segments, said a spokesperson at Westlife FoodWorld, which runs McDonald's in the South and West. The same is true for Tira, from where working professionals and older demographics are now buying Korean beauty products.The Korean craze is gripping smaller towns as well, said Nykaa which will continue to expand the choice of K-Beauty brands on its platform. ""From hydration staples to derma-led brands, K-beauty has evolved from fandom-led discovery to a mainstream, performance-driven category,"" the company said. Rival Myntra claims to have recorded a 200% YoY surge in demand for K-beauty.For ITC Foods too, Korean flavour profile is equally gaining traction in smaller towns, said Hemant Malik, executive director at ITC. The brand's Bingo! Korean chips, in fact, is one of the top penetrated products in Indian households. What has also helped the K-wave is the inclusion of Korean cuisine in restaurants and launch of Korean eateries, said Nishant Kedia, CMO, India at Rebel Foods. ""Burgers worked very well among the three. Some of the items from the three ranges of products are now ongoing items in our menu,"" Kedia said.","Korean trends aren't just passing through, they are embedding themselves into everyday lives and shaping choices across industries.

MUMBAI: The reclassification of real-estate investment trusts (REITs) as equity will make them eligible for inclusion in benchmark indices, drawing in mutual funds and institutional investors.Developers stand to benefit from lower financing costs and more diversified funding, while investors can diversify into real estate with opportunity for steady dividends and potential capital appreciation without the illiquidity of property. An REIT is an entity that owns income-generating real estate and lets investors earn returns from rents and dividends without owning property directly.""The reclassification of REITs as 'equity' for mutual fund investments is also a timely step that will enhance diversification opportunities and support the growth of real estate as an investible asset class,"" says Venkat N Chalsani, chief executive of MF industry body Amfi. ""Taken together, these initiatives will broaden investor participation, strengthen the long-term health of the mutual fund industry, and strike a thoughtful balance between regulatory rigor, investor protection, and ease of doing business. ""For REIT managers, the move is equally transformative. ""At Embassy REIT, we see this as a catalyst to broaden investor participation, enhance liquidity, enable future index inclusion, and further strengthen REITs as a mainstream investment asset class,"" says Amit Shetty, its chief executive.According to a report by Anarock Since the first REIT listing in 2019, the market has grown steadily to about $18 billion in capitalisation as of Aug 2025.

India-US ties: Signs of thaw

Special relationship

Why has the US softened its stance on trade deal talks?

Friction in ties remains





Amidst signs of thaw in the India-US trade deal issues, government officials are likely to travel to America next week. The recent social media post exchanges between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump indicate an improvement in relations following a period of tension.Trade talks are set to resume next week, following a pause triggered by the US imposing additional 25% tariff on India regarding Russian oil purchases. Both leaders are also expected to hold a telephone discussion soon.According to an ET report, Rajesh Agarwal, the chief trade negotiator, will travel to Washington for continued discussions with American officials. A source familiar with the matter quoted in the report indicated the situation remains fluid, with uncertainty surrounding potential US tariff concessions in the coming months.Modi and Trump have expressed mutual goodwill, with the PM responding to the US President's friendly overture on Wednesday.

Charlie Kirk Killing: New Video Shows Killer Jumping Off Roof, Running Away, Then Limping | Watch





A newly surfaced video has raised questions after it appeared to show a bearded man celebrating in the immediate aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.The clip, widely shared on social media and ripped from live TV feeds, shows a young man in a black T-shirt and backwards baseball cap pumping his fists in the air and shouting “USA! USA! USA!” just seconds after Kirk, 31, was fatally struck in the neck by a sniper’s bullet during a campus debate.While most spectators dropped to the ground in panic, the man remained standing, briefly looking back in the direction of the gunfire before raising his arms. His reaction mirrored chants often heard at Trump rallies, including the president’s own cry after he narrowly survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania last year.Social media users quickly seized on the footage, calling it disturbing and “psychotic.” “This guy happens to know where the shooter was and is looking back, cheering him on after the lifeless body of Charlie Kirk has fallen to the ground,” one X user wrote.Another added: “I have no words left.”The Utah County sheriff’s department confirmed it had been contacted about the video.The man’s identity remains unverified, though an X account later claimed to be the individual seen in the clip. In a post, the user — identifying himself only as David — denied celebrating Kirk’s killing and insisted his actions were intended to “draw attention so the security team could escape.”“There is [a lot] of rage directed at me but I promise you’ll understand when I speak,” he wrote. “Some are upset because I smile, some because I [cheer] and others because they don’t have the information yet.”The account follows several prominent conservative figures, including psychologist Jordan Peterson. Authorities have not confirmed whether the account belongs to the man in the video.Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA and a prominent ally of President Donald Trump , was a father of two. He was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after the shooting.","Video appears to show man cheering moments after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot dead at Utah Valley University.

US Tariff War: Donald Trump Blames Russian Oil Imports For India Action, Bessent Pushes EU Action





After threatening tariffs and targeting China over its purchase of Russian oil, US President Donald Trump has now shifted his focus to European allies. He signalled that he does not want European nations to continue buying oil from Russia and criticised their sanctions as ""not tough enough. ""Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump reiterated his longstanding concerns over the Ukraine war and his desire to mediate a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv.He said, ""Europe is buying oil from Russia. I don’t want them to buy oil -- and the sanctions that they’re putting on are not tough enough. I’m willing to do sanctions, but they’re going to have to toughen up their sanctions commensurate with what I’m doing.""Trump argued that Moscow benefits financially from oil sales and its key buyers. He has repeatedly called out India, China, and now European countries for purchasing Russian oil -- even imposing a 50 per cent tariff on India over what he called its “massive oil purchase” from Russia.Recently, Trump urged Nato allies to sanction Beijing at rates of 50 to 100 per cent, accusing China of funding Russia and strengthening its military capacity in the Ukraine conflict.Beijing responded indirectly, with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi saying China is committed to “promoting peace talks to resolve hot-spot issues,” and that “wars cannot solve problems and sanctions would only complicate them.”China also clarified that “it does not participate in or plan wars” and emphasised dialogue, while calling for closer cooperation with Europe. Wang Yi made these remarks during his meeting with Slovenian counterpart Tanja Fajon.Notably, in this latest push, Trump left India out of his criticism, amid signs Washington and New Delhi are working on a separate agreement.","US President Donald Trump has shifted his focus to European allies.

The United States and China launched trade talks in Madrid on Sunday, with both sides confirming discussions on economic issues as well as the ongoing dispute over TikTok, according to AFP. The meeting brings together US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at a time when trade tensions between the two powers remain unresolved.“The Chinese and US delegations convened here on Sunday for talks on economic and trade issues,” China’s official Xinhua news agency reported from Madrid. The Spanish government also confirmed the talks, which are being held at the Palacio de Santa Cruz, the headquarters of Spain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.The Chinese delegation will remain in Madrid until Wednesday, officials said.Trade relations between Washington and Beijing have been marked by volatility this year, with both sides imposing tariffs that reached triple digits at their peak, disrupting global supply chains. However, the two governments agreed to de-escalate tensions, temporarily reducing tariffs to 30 percent on US exports to China and 10 percent on Chinese goods entering the United States.In August, the countries agreed to delay the reimposition of higher duties for another 90 days, keeping the pause on steeper tariffs in place until November 10.Alongside trade, the TikTok dispute is also a major item on the agenda. The US has set September 17 as the deadline for the social media platform to secure a non-Chinese buyer or face a nationwide ban. President Donald Trump has already extended the deadline three times.China’s commerce ministry last week urged Washington to resolve the issue through dialogue. “We call on the United States to work with China on the basis of mutual respect and equal consultations, to resolve each other’s concerns through dialogue and find a solution to the problem,” it said in a statement.A federal law requiring TikTok to be sold or banned on national security grounds had been set to take effect the day before Trump’s January inauguration.According to AFP, the Madrid talks mark the latest attempt by the world’s two largest economies to navigate a fraught relationship that has unsettled global markets.","US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng meet in Madrid.

China has hit back strongly at Donald Trump-led US after Washington called on its Nato allies to impose major sanctions on Beijing -- 50 to 100 per cent -- alleging China’s role in funding Russia and adding to its lethal potency in the war against Ukraine.In response, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi reiterated that China is committed to promoting peace talks to resolve hot-spot issues, saying ""wars cannot solve problems and sanctions would only complicate them.""Wang made the remarks at a press conference in Ljubljana on Saturday after his meeting with Slovenia’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs, Tanja Fajon, China Daily reported.“China does not participate in or plan wars, and what China does is to encourage peace talks and promote political settlement of hotspot issues through dialogue,” Wang Yi said.The Chinese foreign minister also called for promoting multilateralism, strengthening multilateral mechanisms, and jointly safeguarding the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.He specified that the current international situation is marked by “intertwined chaos and continuous conflicts.”“China and Europe should be friends rather than rivals, and should cooperate rather than confront each other. Making the right choices amid the greatest changes in a century demonstrates the responsibilities that both sides should fulfill towards history and the people,” Wang Yi said, as reported by Global Times.His veiled reference came shortly after US President Donald Trump on Saturday proposed that Nato impose tariffs of 50 per cent to 100 per cent on China.“I believe that this, plus Nato, as a group, placing 50 per cent to 100 per cent TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip.”Trump’s renewed tariff threat came on the heels of his recent attempts to mediate and broker peace in the ongoing, intensifying war between Russia and Ukraine.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump shifted his focus to European allies. He signalled that he does not want European nations to continue buying oil from Russia and criticised their sanctions as ""not tough enough.""He said, ""Europe is buying oil from Russia. I don’t want them to buy oil -- and the sanctions that they’re putting on are not tough enough.

The accusation followed China’s largest-ever military parade held on September 3, which North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin attended.Hours after accusing Chinese President Xi Jinping of “conspiring against” America, Trump said his personal ties with the Chinese leadership were “very good.”Interestingly, this time, Trump left India out of his recent gambit, amid indications that Washington and New Delhi are working towards a separate deal.Earlier, Trump had also targeted India with his tariff rhetoric, already imposing a 50 per cent duty on New Delhi on similar grounds, accusing it of bolstering Russia through its “massive oil purchase"" from Moscow.","China has hit back strongly at Donald Trump-led US after Washington called on its Nato allies to impose major sanctions on Beijing.

Cracks in the alliance system

A shifting US role





India, long courted by US as a counterweight to China, has suddenly found itself at the sharp end of Donald Trump’s “America First” foreign policy.The US president has ramped up sanctions on New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil, angering Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and straining ties between the world’s two largest democracies.For decades, both Republican and Democratic leaders held up India as a strategic partner in Asia. Trump’s move marks a break from that tradition.Adding to the tension, Trump appeared visibly irritated after PM Modi downplayed US efforts to broker peace between India and Pakistan, even as other world leaders rushed to congratulate the newly returned president. “Trump expected Modi to echo his line more strongly,” AFP quotes a senior diplomat as saying, who was familiar with the exchange.The sanctions come at a moment when India is stepping up defense cooperation with the US while simultaneously balancing its historic ties with Russia. As per the report by AFP, analysts warn Trump’s hard line could push New Delhi closer to Moscow and Beijing.Damian Murphy, a former congressional aide now at the Center for American Progress, said the approach showed “weakness, chaos and vanity.” He argued that leaders like Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu “are pushing for advantage, sensing weakness, and getting away with things that they shouldn’t be able to.”India is not alone in feeling the sting.In Georgia, mass raids at a Hyundai-LG battery plant stunned South Korea, another treaty ally investing billions in the US.Meanwhile, Israel launched strikes inside Qatar, home to America’s largest air base in the Middle East, while Trump stood by. And in Europe, Poland was rattled after 17 Russian drones landed on its territory, despite Trump’s pleas to Moscow for a ceasefire in Ukraine.Trump’s aides defend the moves as holding partners to higher standards, a break from what they call decades of “free riding” by allies. His Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, described it as “America First diplomacy in action.”But scholars warn the approach risks undermining US influence just as global instability rises. “These are smaller instances of a much larger trend,” said Paul Poast, a University of Chicago political scientist. “States feel emboldened to act militarily because the US no longer behaves like the world’s police force.”","India, long courted by US as a counterweight to China, has suddenly found itself at the sharp end of Donald Trump’s “America First” foreign policy.

Trump ‘Directs’ G7 Nations To ‘Put High Tariffs’ On India & China For Buying Russian Oil | Report

Tariffs on China, sanctions on Russia



Tensions in Nato and Europe







US President Donald Trump has threatened sweeping new tariffs of up to 100% on Chinese goods while calling on Nato allies to halt oil purchases from Russia, arguing that such measures would end the war in Ukraine swiftly.In an aggressive post on Truth Social, which he described as “a letter to all Nato nations and the world,” Trump claimed that only decisive economic action could stop what he called a “deadly, but ridiculous, war.” He insisted that Nato had failed to fully commit to defeating Moscow and accused some members of weakening the alliance by continuing to buy Russian oil.“I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all Nato Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all Nato Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,” Trump wrote. “Anyway, I am ready to ‘go’ when you are. Just say when?”Trump went further, urging the alliance to impose punitive tariffs on Beijing, ranging from 50 to 100 per cent, arguing that Beijing’s support was vital to Moscow’s war effort. “China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip,” he wrote, suggesting the tariffs would be lifted once the conflict ended.The president blamed his predecessor Joe Biden and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy for prolonging the war, while absolving Russian President Vladimir Putin. “This is not TRUMP’S WAR (it would never have started if I was President!), it is Biden’s and Zelenskyy’s WAR,” he said.Trump claimed that “7,118 lives” had been lost in the past week alone, describing the bloodshed as “crazy” and insisting his approach could end the conflict rapidly. “If Nato does as I say, the WAR will end quickly, and all of those lives will be saved! If not, you are just wasting my time, and the time, energy, and money of the United States,” he added.Trump’s remarks come amid heightened tensions after Russian drones entered Polish airspace last week, prompting Nato fighters to intercept them. Poland and other European leaders dismissed Trump’s suggestion that the incursion might have been a “mistake,” calling it a deliberate provocation.Nato has since launched “Eastern Sentry,” a new defensive operation bolstering its eastern flank with aircraft and ground systems from France, Denmark, Germany and the UK. Meanwhile, Britain and France announced fresh sanctions and military support to Ukraine, while Canada, chairing the G7 this year, convened finance ministers to discuss cutting off Russia’s revenues.The Trump administration has already imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods, including a 25 per cent levy linked to New Delhi’s purchase of Russian crude. The move has strained US-India trade ties, with talks on a new agreement delayed.Speaking to G7 countries, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent and trade representative Jamieson Greer echoed Trump’s message, urging allies to form a “unified front” against Moscow’s oil revenues. “Only with a unified effort that cuts off the revenues funding Putin’s war machine at the source will we be able to apply sufficient economic pressure to end the senseless killing,” they said.Despite international measures, Russian attacks on Ukraine have escalated, with Moscow unleashing massive drone strikes while Kyiv hit back at Russia’s largest oil port in the Baltic.","US President Donald Trump has threatened sweeping new tariffs of up to 100% on Chinese goods.

France credit downgrade: Fitch cuts rating to A+ from AA- in a record low; political turmoil clouds debt outlook,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/france-credit-downgrade-fitch-cuts-rating-to-a-from-aa-in-a-record-low-political-turmoil-clouds-debt-outlook/articleshow/123863190.cms,"File photo: French President Emmanuel Macron (Picture credit: AP)





France’s sovereign credit rating has been cut by Fitch to A+ from AA-, with the agency warning that public debt will keep rising until at least 2027 unless urgent corrective steps are taken.The move marks the lowest rating France has received on record from a major credit agency, though Fitch maintained a stable outlook for future moves, as per news agency AFP.The downgrade comes at a politically sensitive moment, just days after François Bayrou stepped down as prime minister following a failed parliamentary confidence vote over his austerity-driven budget.Bayrou reacted sharply on X, saying France was “a country whose elites lead it to reject the truth (and) is condemned to pay the price.” President Emmanuel Macron has since appointed Sébastien Lecornu to form a new government, though he faces a divided parliament with little room to push through deep spending cuts.Fitch said the confidence vote defeat showed how “fragmentation and polarisation” in domestic politics weakened France’s ability to deliver fiscal consolidation.The agency added it was unlikely the deficit would be reduced to 3% of GDP by 2029, contrary to earlier government ambitions.France recorded a budget deficit of 5.8% of GDP in 2024 and debt at 113% of GDP, far above eurozone thresholds of 3% and 60%.Fitch now projects debt to climb to 121% by 2027, with no “clear horizon” for stabilisation.Outgoing economy minister Eric Lombard acknowledged the downgrade but insisted on the “solidity” of the French economy. Rising borrowing costs are already evident: French 10-year bond yields reached 3.47% this week, close to Italy’s levels, though Italy carries a much lower rating.Analysts cited by news agency Reuters said the downgrade had largely been priced in, but warned it could spur forced selling of French bonds if other agencies follow suit. Rival rater S&P Global is due to update its assessment in November.For Prime Minister Lecornu, Fitch’s move heightens the challenge of presenting a new budget by early October.To secure support, he may need to soften plans with concessions such as higher taxes on the wealthy or easing pension reforms, though such compromises risk alienating Macron’s centrist base and conservative allies.","France's sovereign credit rating has been cut by Fitch to A+ from AA-, with the agency warning that public debt will keep rising until at least 2027 unless urgent corrective steps are taken.

Russia’s central bank on Friday reduced its benchmark interest rate by one percentage point to 17%, signalling an attempt to support the economy as growth slows and government spending on the war in Ukraine drives the budget deficit higher.The bank, which had previously raised the key rate to 21% to curb inflation, acknowledged that economic activity was being weighed down by high borrowing costs and sought to ease pressure on businesses. Inflation remains elevated at 8.2% despite easing slightly in July and August, with the bank warning that “inflation expectations have not changed considerably in recent months” and could hinder a sustainable slowdown in price rises. AFP reported that the move highloights the tension between controlling inflation and supporting a wartime economy under stress.Year-on-year growth slowed to 1.1% in the second quarter, down from 1.4% in the first quarter and 4.5% at the end of 2024. On a quarterly basis, the economy contracted 0.6%, indicating a recent loss of momentum. The budget deficit rose sharply to 4.9 trillion rubles ($58 billion) in January–July, compared with 1.1 trillion rubles a year earlier, with spending at 129% of planned levels, according to the Kyiv School of Economics.Oil and gas revenues fell 19% from the previous year amid softer global prices.Despite Western sanctions and the loss of gas sales to Europe, Russia’s economy has shown resilience, with unemployment at record lows and household incomes rising.

South Korea ATTACKS Trump; Big Clash Over Chaining Of Koreans During ICE Hyundai Factory Raid





US President Donald Trump’s drive to boost American manufacturing by drawing foreign investment has collided with his hardline immigration agenda, after a dramatic raid at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia left South Korea warning of investment risks.US immigration authorities raided the site last week, detaining more than 300 South Korean workers, some of whom were shown shackled in chains. The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis, with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung cautioning that companies from his country may rethink Trump’s invitation to pour money into the US.“If the US can’t promptly issue visas to the technicians and other skilled workers needed to launch plants, then establishing a local factory in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies,” Lee said on Thursday.“They will wonder whether they should even do it”, he added.As per news agency AP, the crackdown has clashed with Trump’s trade-driven economic policy.His administration has imposed hefty tariffs, including a 15% levy on South Korean goods, as leverage to force foreign companies to shift production to America. South Korea, already a leading investor, pledged $350 billion in US projects during a July trade deal.But the Georgia raid, involving 475 people in total, has cast a shadow on those commitments.Many of the detained workers were flown back to Seoul on Friday aboard a Korean Air charter plane, drawing a huge media presence and emotional family reunions at Incheon International Airport, as per AP.While the White House insisted Trump remains committed to making the US the “best place in the world to do business” while upholding immigration law, critics labelled the raid “performative.”Immigration lawyer Dan Kowalski was quoted as saying by AP that the roundup was about “wanting to look tough, arresting as many foreigners as possible for the photo-op.”Experts also questioned the enforcement tactic. “It’s really baffling to me why this raid would have occurred. The existence of these workers shouldn’t have been a surprise,” said Ben Armstrong of MIT’s Industrial Performance Center, as per AP.South Korea has long requested reform of the US visa system, which experts say does not account for the temporary inflow of skilled foreign workers needed to set up new plants.Following talks in Washington, South Korean foreign minister Cho Hyun said the two countries agreed to establish a joint working group to explore a new visa category for such workers.Despite the diplomatic efforts, the raid has rattled trust.The battery factory in Georgia is one of more than 20 major industrial projects under construction by South Korean firms in the US. But as President Lee noted, unless the visa system improves, companies may “hesitate to make further investments.”","US immigration authorities raided the site last week, detaining more than 300 South Korean workers, some of whom were shown shackled in chains.

On Wednesday, Oracle stunned Wall Street when its shares surged 36% in a single day, the company’s biggest one-day gain since 1992. The rise followed its announcement of a series of multibillion-dollar deals in artificial intelligence (AI) cloud infrastructure, including a landmark agreement with OpenAI.The rally was so dramatic that Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly overtook Elon Musk as the world’s richest person before market corrections set in.At the centre of the surge is Oracle’s $300 billion, five-year agreement with OpenAI, one of the largest cloud computing contracts ever signed.The company will provide computing resources and infrastructure to power OpenAI’s advanced models.Oracle has also struck deals with Nvidia, SoftBank, Meta, and xAI, signalling its transformation into a core provider of AI infrastructure.CEO Safra Catz revealed that Oracle’s backlog of finalised contracts has reached $455 billion, four times higher than last year, and is expected to cross $500 billion soon.This backlog offers investors confidence in sustained long-term revenue, even as quarterly results sometimes fall short of projections, as reported by ET.Oracle’s position in AI cloud computing now puts it in direct competition with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.The company expects revenue from its cloud infrastructure business to rise 77% to $18 billion this year, and reach $144 billion within four years, according to news agency AP.The surge in Oracle’s stock briefly added around $100 billion to Ellison’s wealth, pushing him past Elon Musk in Bloomberg’s billionaire rankings.Musk, whose fortune is closely tied to Tesla, regained the top spot later in the day. But as AP noted, the episode highlighted how AI-driven optimism is reshaping wealth dynamics among tech leaders.Oracle’s resurgence positions it as a critical enabler of global AI adoption.By providing high-performance, reliable cloud infrastructure, the company is not just fuelling chatbot development but also supporting applications in robotics, pharmaceuticals, finance, and automation. Or as Ellison himself summed it up during an earnings call: “AI changes everything.”","Oracle shares surged 36% in a single day, the company's biggest one-day gain since 1992.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

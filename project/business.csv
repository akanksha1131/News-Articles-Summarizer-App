SBI customers take note of new scam! Imposters extorting money with these 7 steps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-customers-take-note-of-new-scam-imposters-extorting-money-with-these-7-steps/articleshow/115962047.cms,"Always authenticate the identity of the caller or sender. Legitimate organizations generally do not request sensitive information.

How the CBI, I-T imposter scam operates:

The first step to prevent falling prey to such frauds is to understand the modus operandi of scamsters. Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services told ET explains how the fraud works:

Initiating the contact: The whole process begins with an imposter identifying any exploitable customer and contacting him/her through voice or video call, usually over messenger apps. The key element of the fraud is the bait that tricks the victim into believing the official has some critical information about them. This bait may include personal information like KYC number, address or any other information like assets etc.

Convincing the victim: The imposter then uses this information in such a way that the victim gets easily convinced. For example telling them about any property they bought and not paying the required tax for it. The fraudster may obtain this information from property websites where you have listed details, from a property broker’s website, or even from a data breach at the property registrar's office.

Narrating a fake story: Once the victim is convinced that the imposter is a genuine CBI or income tax official, the fraudster fabricates a story, claiming that the victim has evaded taxes or missed an important legal process, and therefore faces the possibility of arrest.

Falling into the trap: Hearing words like ""jail,"" ""arrest,"" and ""legal proceedings"" naturally triggers a sense of panic in people. The fraudster exploits this fear and panic to manipulate the victim into compliance.

Staging fake evidence: Meanwhile, the fraudster further ""stages"" the situation by scrutinizing fake documents and, in some cases, even simulating a police interrogation, pressurizing the victim into providing additional personal information, such as Aadhaar details, bank account numbers, and other sensitive data. This is then used by the scammers to easily access the victim’s bank account and other details.

Last nail in the coffin: The fraudster sets a well-planned trap that deceives numerous victims and once the victim believes the investigation will be lengthy, the fraudsters offer an escape route to the victim claiming that their innocence can only be confirmed after thorough verification. The victim is assured that the ‘official’ will take care of all legal, tax, and other issues, provided that the victim pays them a bribe and directs them to transfer money to multiple bank accounts throughout the investigation, with the promise that the funds will be refunded once the inquiry is completed.

How to avoid these frauds

Social engineering

Steps to prevent online frauds

Always authenticate the identity of the caller or sender. Legitimate organizations generally do not request sensitive information through phone calls, SMS, or video calls. Be cautious if someone threatens you with legal action or fines as genuine organizations typically communicate through official channels, allowing sufficient time for the victim to respond. Never share personal or financial information with anyone who contacts you unexpectedly. Report any suspicious messages to your bank and local law enforcement authorities. Enable security features such as two-factor authentication on your bank accounts and use strong, unique passwords for each service.

The State Bank of India has recently warned its customers about a new series of scams where imposters posing as CBI or Income Tax Department officials threaten people with a made up supposed legal action in order to extort money.It said, ""Dear SBI Customer, Fraudsters may pose as CBI or IT Dept officials and may threaten legal action or heavy fines to extort money from you. Beware of such frauds”.Also Read| PAN 2.0: Why you should apply for new PAN Card with QR code - top 5 benefits explained Shiksha Goel, who is an IPS, DGP CID & Women Safety Wing, director Telangana Cyber Security Bureau & Telangana FSL stated that no law enforcement agency or government body contacts consumers to conduct an investigation online, nor do they ask individuals to resolve legal matters through a video call.“In these cases the common narrative is to induce the fear of legal action on the victim for a made up incident and then extort money from them.”In case of receiving these kinds of threats, the victims must not be alarmed, instead ask the other person on the call to meet you at the nearest police station or government office.ET quoted Sheetal R Bhardwaj, executive member of Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists (ACFCS) as saying, “This type of scam is commonly known as ""phishing"" or ""social engineering.Bhardwaj added that these scams have now become a major concern globally rather than India.“The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States reports millions of dollars lost to fraud each year.

NEW DELHI: India's gross foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows rose nearly 29% to $42.3 billon during the first half of the current fiscal year, taking the overall overseas investment to $1 trillion since April 2000.The rise during the current fiscal year comes after two consecutive years of fall, indicating that investors globally are more upbeat on India. While gross FDI includes reinvested earnings by foreign investors and other capital, the rise is more impressive if just the equity component is looked at - 45% jump to just under $21 billion. The equity inflows since April 2000 are pegged at $708 billion, latest data available with the department for promotion of industry and internal trade showed.According to OECD data, during Jan-June 2024, the US was the top destination for FDI ($153 billion), followed by Brazil ($32 billion), Mexico ($31 billion), with India placed eighth. During this period, FDI inflows in China were down 29% to $70 billion, with the numbers for Jan-Aug 2024 pegging investments at $82 billion, 31% lower than last year.Since the Covid crisis, the global FDI landscape has become more competitive with countries courting investors with sops to woo them away from China as companies seek to diversify their production bases to de-risk their operations. Industrial policy is back in focus with countries - from the US to Australia - lining up incentives to attract investment. India too has rolled out the production-linked incentive schemeand other measures to attract global investors.Mexico is seen as one of the beneficiaries of the China Plus One strategy along with Vietnam but with the Trump administration due to take charge next month, there could be some change in trends.The latest World Investment Report by Unctad showed that Asia is the main battleground for FDI with the continent attracting $678 billion in 2023, more than half the global flows of $1.3 trillion and 50% higher than the $426 billion going to developed markets.","India's gross foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows rose nearly 29% to $42.3 billon.

NEW DELHI: Amid slowdown in demand for new cars and steep discounts, the talk of a price hike by car companies in the new year has surprised other industry stakeholders as dealers grapple with large inventory.Announcements regarding price hikes towards the end of the year have become almost an annual ritual as companies resort to desperate measures to clear piled-up inventory because unsold vehicles will need to be liquidated with heavy discounts if they flow into the new year. Often, the price increase ""considered"" by companies does not translate into a hike in Jan.So far, the call for price hikes - of around 3% - has already come from companies ranging from Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra, JSW MG Motor, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz. Ironically, many of them are already throwing in steep discounts to lure buyers. The discounts run from a few thousand of rupees for small cars, to much higher for bigger SUVs and sedans, and lakhs for the luxury brands.Justifying the prices hikes, M&M (like other companies) blamed inflation and increased commodity prices.Industry officials, however, say that this smacks of a ""desperate attempt to lure buyers"" as carmakers try to clear pending inventory before the new year.""This conversation is more of a marketing trick to get people to the showrooms, especially with footfalls being low post the festive period. Companies want to clear current-year inventory before the new year begins and thus talk about price hikes. The fact is that price hikes may not happen across all the models, and many a times can only be on select variants,"" an industry official told TOI.C S Vigneshwar, president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), said the practice of calling out price hikes when there is already heavy inventory at the retail level is not healthy. ""Last month, there was an inventory of 75 days at the dealerships, and we are now calculating the levels for this month.""Vigneshwar said companies should not ""flood"" dealerships with new stocks when the past stock is already more than required. ""Stop sending us these many new vehicles, and temper down a bit.""Ravi Bhatia, president of analytics firm JATO Dynamics, said that significant discounts on models like the Mahindra XUV4OO, JSW MG Gloster, and VW Tiguan highlight the efforts of automakers to drive year-end sales and clear inventory.""Maruti's consideration of a price hike in Jan may face challenges in this competitive landscape, where rivals are leveraging aggressive incentives. Balancing profitability with consumer sentiment will be critical for Maruti to sustain its leadership in this price-sensitive market,"" Bhatia said.","Announcements regarding price hikes towards the end of the year have become almost an annual ritual.

NEW DELHI: Eli Lilly , the US pharmaceutical giant that gained widespread attention globally with its weight-loss treatments, plans to launch its blockbuster drug - Tirzepatide - in India in 2025.""India presents a promising market, with a large and growing population, rising disease burden from obesity, diabetes, and cancer, and an increasing health expenditure ... A combination of all of this makes us very optimistic about the India opportunity. We are committed to bringing our next line of innovations to the country, starting with our obesity pipeline and Tirzepatide in 2025,"" Vineet Gupta, associate VP - MD, Eli Lilly (India) told TOI in an exclusive interview.In India, the drug will be introduced under the brand name Mounjaro, targeting both type 2 diabetes and obesity. The company received marketing authorisation for the drug earlier in July, and is working to get the additional approvals, ahead of its 2025 launch.Sales of Mounjaro globally for Q3 2024, stood at over $3.1 billion. Meanwhile, its Danish rival, Novo Nordisk with the ground-breaking Wegovy, has reportedly said it plans to get the drug in 2026 to India.Soaring global demand for weight-loss drugs has propelled drug biggies Lilly and Novo Nordisk among the world's most valuable companies as they aggressively compete in the obesity market that analysts predict could cross $100 billion in the next decade. The surge in demand has led firms to scramble to scale up production capacity globally.In the US, the price of Mounjaro is around $1,000 per fill, but the amount a patient pays depends on factors like insurance. A huge demand for weight loss among affluent Indians, particularly celebs, has led to them being imported through unofficial channels, sidestepping regulatory checks. These are available at a fraction of the US price, majorly in the grey market.Gupta said that the company has not decided on the pricing of Tirzepatide for India, but it ""will be priced competitively and appropriately which will reflect the efficacy of this medicine and also the value that it will bring in reducing the overall health and economic burden of type 2 diabetes and obesity"".Through the launch of Mounjaro, the company will widen its key diabetes portfolio in the country. In diabetes, it has distribution partnerships with two domestic pharma companies: for Huminsulin range of products with Lupin, and for Humalog and Trulicity with Cipla.""Our strategy in India has been a mix since we set up shop in 1993.

BENGALURU: Karnataka saw a steady increase in women income tax return (ITR) filers over the past five years, with numbers climbing to 14.3 lakh in the assessment year 2023-24 from 11.3 lakh in 2019-20, recording an impressive growth of approximately 26%.Nationally, Maharashtra leads the pack with 36.8 lakh women ITR filers in 2023-24, showing a 23% growth over five years. Gujarat follows with 22.5 lakh women and a 24% increase. Uttar Pradesh reported a 29% growth, reaching 20.4 lakh women filers.Karnataka's YoY growth shows a pattern of progression, barring a slight dip in AY 2020-21 (pandemic year) to around 11 lakh, from which the state quickly rebounded with 11.7 lakh filers in 2021-22.The subsequent years saw more growth, as per the latest data made public by the finance ministry.This suggests a combination of factors at play - improved economic opportunities, possible increased workforce participation, and potentially a more progressive social environment that encourages women's financial independence.The ministry's data is for the period up to September 30, 2024.The break-up of how many of the women ITR filers paid taxes and the quantum of taxes paid by women was not immediately available. Separate data accessed by TOI for overall ITR filers in the state showed 38.2 lakh, 39.2 lakh, 39.8 lakh, and 42.6 lakh filers in 2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22, and 2022-23.While the number of filers for 2023-24 is estimated to be around 43 lakh, a final figure is not available.Going by this, women constituted a third of all ITR filers in the state in the latest assessment year, while it was only 29% in 2019-20, indicating that the growth in women filers was higher than the overall growth.While states like Telangana show the most remarkable percentage increase at 39%, they have lower absolute numbers, and the data reveals variations across different states.West Bengal and Tamil Nadu show consistent growth, with 12.9 lakh and 15.5 lakh women filers, respectively.Delhi shows a more modest growth of 11%, reaching 12.08 lakh women tax filers. Andhra Pradesh presents the most conservative growth among compared states, with 6.5 lakh women filers and an 18% increase over five years.","Karnataka saw a steady increase in women income tax return (ITR) filers over the past five years.

"Using tech to buy, sell agri produce",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/using-tech-to-buy-sell-agri-produce/articleshow/116111201.cms,"The story of Hector Global began when Chennai boys Srinath Srinivasan, Sibhi Kumaran, and Aswath Kowligi Balaji met at the National University of Singapore while pursuing a master’s degree. When they returned home, they decided to set up their own startup. Their first venture was in the cross-border trade domain but focused purely on branded FMCG products. By early 2023 though they were looking at a different market opportunity.“The idea for Hector Global was sparked during an exploratory visit to the Guntur mirchi yard,” says Balaji. “We were surprised to find that a single commodity — dry red chillies originating from this region — had an export value of more than $1 billion.” But what excited the trio most were the complexities involved: identifying the variety, assessing quality, finding the right supplier, grading, managing freight, and handling documentation. “We realized how challenging it would be for a buyer thousands of miles away in a different country to procure this commodity, especially since there is no option for returns or refunds.”The three friends travelled to multiple mandis across India and visited wholesale markets globally. “We discovered that cross-border agri supply chains are extremely complex, and there was a need to build a solution to simplify procurement for global food buyers,” says Balaji. This led to them to incorporate Hectar Global, a B2B cross-border agri-commodity procurement platform, in January 2023 with Balaji as co-founder and COO, Kumaran as co-founder & CBO, and Srinivasan as co-founder & CEO.In July 2023, the startup raised a seed round funding of $2.1 million led by Powerhouse Ventures with participation from WEH ventures, All In Capital, Indian Silicon Valley, and angel investors Anant Sarda and Adhish Ladha. “With that, we have scaled our portfolio to 15 commodities and a client base in 17 geographies with direct operations in four of them,” says Balaji. “Over the next couple of years, we will focus on strengthening our downstream capabilities in Africa, South, Southeast Asia,” he adds.Currently, Hector Global has offices in Singapore, India, Bangladesh, and UAE. “We have a 17-member team and work across product categories such as rice, spices, pulses, oils, and nuts,” says Balaji. “Our operations span South Asia and Africa, where we are involved in the direct sourcing and distribution of agricultural commodities.”Looking ahead, the company is focusing on aggressive geography expansion. “Over the next 3-5 years, our goal is to be a major contributor to the movement of agricultural commodities along the Asia-Africa trade corridor,” says Balaji. This will require deep sourcing capabilities in regions of origin and strong downstream networks in regions of consumption supported by technology. “Along with building a team of experienced traders, we will hire experts in artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop models that will enable data-backed trade decisions,” he says.Future fund raises will be used to build direct operations in strategic markets, especially in Africa, South, and Southeast Asia, and to expand tech to optimise trade operations. “We will deploy additional funds to build robust on-ground teams to strengthen our sourcing and distribution capabilities and hire experts across technology and operations,” says Balaji.Looking back, the Hector Global trio are unanimous that the smartest thing they did before incorporating their business was travelling across markets to experience the challenges in agri trade firsthand. “This ground-level understanding helped us validate that our solution wasn’t just interesting but necessary and helped maintain focus on solving real problems for global buyers,” he says.","Hector Global is a B2B cross-border agri-commodity procurement platform.

Edited excerpts: How is Tamil Nadu attracting foreign investments, including Ford, Foxconn and Cisco?Tamil Nadu provides good infrastructure and ease of doing business. In 2021, Ford announced it needed to shut production in the state. The Tamil Nadu govt realised market realities and helped Ford exit by resolving complex labour and land issues. That experience convinced Ford that the risks of doing business here are low. So, when the company decided to make a new investment in India, it chose Tamil Nadu. The recent Samsung strike is also another good example. Attracting private investment is not just about implementing some policy. It’s a matter of showing consistency in policies and creating a good climate for investors. As Chief Economic Adviser, you proposed universal basic income (UBI). State govts are now announcing financial aid to women and other targeted groups. Will this weaken states financially?We advocated UBI in the economic survey. We also suggested reducing expenditure, including power subsidy, fertilizer subsidy, and railway subsidy, to finance the UBI. Many of these subsidies are for richer people. So why not reduce that to finance some of these things? That’s not happened, and that’s why the finances of states have become weak. For example, in Tamil Nadu, power subsidy, including loss funding, is 35,000 crore. It also led to competitive populism among states. One thing about UBI, which I hadn’t anticipated, is how easily it lends itself to competitive populism. States have to start reducing subsidies and look for resource mobilisation in property taxes and stamp duties. Has implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) crippled states’ finances?That’s not true at all. Once GST was implemented, all state govts got 14% revenue as guarantee. Because of the guarantee, their GST ratio to GDP went up relative to the pre-GST system. It’s the central govt that took the hit for that. The central govt’s GST collection came down. In the last two years, because the compensation is being used to repay the borrowing, everyone — Centre and the states — has taken a hit. Once the loan is repaid, most state govts will see an improvement in GST and GDP. For most, it would be close to what it was during pre-GST. From 2026 onwards, the financial situation of states will get better. The Tamil Nadu CM recently called for increasing the share of states in the divisible pool of taxes to 50%. What is your view?I would say that at the very minimum, the spirit of the Fifteenth Finance Commission recommendation, that states should get 41% of central taxes, should be maintained. The Centre has violated that by imposing all the cesses. The best number should be 41% or 45% and people can debate that. The Centre is reducing the size of the divisible pool by imposing all the cesses. The spirit of that recommendation should be maintained. The Reserve Bank of India recently lowered the growth estimate for the current fiscal year from 7.2% to 6.6%. What should India do to achieve a higher growth rate?We have to go on a mission mode to attract all these investments that are leaving China. For the country to grow, Uttar Pradesh has to grow, Bihar has to grow. Unless they attract private investments, they will be stuck in low growth, and India will be stuck in low growth. The growth in Tamil Nadu is helping other states via migration. At some point, they must provide for their own people. If India is to develop its manufacturing sector, this Tamil Nadu experience have to be replicated in the populous states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh with their cheaper labour pools.","Tamil Nadu provides good infrastructure and ease of doing business, says Arvind Subramanian.

from 1970 until his death in 2000, a leader who shaped the country through a combination of military dominance, political maneuvering, and brutal repression. Born into the Alawite minority , a sect of Shia Islam, Assad rose to prominence within the Syrian military, particularly during the sectarian power struggles that gripped the country in the 1960s.

, a sect of Shia Islam, Assad rose to prominence within the Syrian military, particularly during the sectarian power struggles that gripped the country in the 1960s. As defense minister and air force commander, he played a key role in the 1966 struggle for power within the Baath Party, ultimately seizing control in a bloodless coup on November 13, 1970. This marked the end of Syria's tenth military coup in seventeen years, bringing a fragile stability to a country long plagued by turmoil.

Assad consolidated his power by using the Baath Party as a facade while positioning members of the Alawite minority in crucial military and intelligence roles, particularly within the special forces and armored corps.

In 1982, when Muslim extremists in Hama rebelled, Assad's forces carried out a brutal crackdown, leveling much of the city and killing thousands of civilians.

While Assad's rule was marked by severe repression, many Syrians appreciated the relative stability and order he brought to a country that had experienced nearly constant upheaval since gaining independence.

He ruled through emergency decrees for over three decades, leaving behind a legacy of both fear and admiration. After his death in 2000, Syria came under the control of his son, Bashar al-Assad.

As rebels advanced on the Syrian capital, anti-regime protests intensified across the country. In the Jermana suburb, just ten kilometers from central Damascus, demonstrators brought down the statue of Hafez al-Assad , the late father of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Saturday. The act of defiance was followed by the destruction of a statue of Bashar’s late brother, Bassel al-Assad, in Aleppo, a city that had also witnessed mounting resistance.In addition to toppling statues, protesters tore down posters of both Bashar and Hafez al-Assad, challenging the personality cult that had been meticulously cultivated around them by the ruling Baath Party .","Hafez al-Assad was the president of Syria from 1970 until his death in 2000.

TSMC rules

Trump tariffs

As South Korea descends into political chaos, its equity market risks falling further behind major tech rival Taiwan, which is basking in the glory of the global artificial intelligence boom.A near 30% surge in Taiwan’s stock benchmark this year, set to be the best since 2009, has already helped spur a historic divergence between Asia’s two tech-dominated markets. The island’s market capitalization now exceeds South Korea’s by about $950 billion as the world’s AI frontrunners from Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to OpenAI all increasingly turn to Taiwanese firms for supply.Looking ahead to next year, while both export-oriented economies face the risk of higher tariffs by incoming US President Donald Trump, many investors see Taiwan as less vulnerable given the reliance of American firms on its technology as well as its relatively better economic prospects.Such optimism, and a recent pickup in inflows into local stocks, also augur well for the Taiwanese dollar, which has fared better than the Korean won in 2024.“The structural theme of AI is likely to only get extended further, and this means we could see another year of Taiwan outperformance,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore. “The Korea discount may linger for longer given the recent political debacle, and the corporate governance reforms will have to be prioritized to get any closer to erasing this discount.”South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is fighting for his political life after his attempt to break an impasse in parliament by briefly imposing martial law backfired. The turmoil has cast a pall over the nation’s outlook and it also may impact the Corporate Value-Up program much touted by Yoon as a way to boost shareholder returns and eradicate the so-called Korea Discount, a term referring to the long depressed valuations of the country’s equities.Down more than 8% this year, the Kospi is one of the world’s worst-performing major equity indexes. Its underperformance versus Taiwan’s Taiex has deepened further this month.Taiwan’s equity-market outperformance has a lot to do with this year’s 80% surge in the shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s top advanced chipmaker that accounts for 37% of the benchmark’s weighting. The company is the major supplier of Nvidia and Apple Inc.’s most advanced chips.In contrast, shares of Samsung Electronics Co. — South Korea’s most-valued company — have been the biggest drag on its local market. Samsung’s stock has slumped 31% in Seoul this year on concerns that the firm is missing out on the AI boom due to slow progress on technological breakthroughs and lingering management woes.Overall, Taiwan’s exposure to AI goes far beyond TSMC: over 40 AI-related firms constitute about 73% of MSCI Taiwan’s index weighting, according to Goldman Sachs Group analysts. At 33%, Korea is a distant second in Asia and features SK Hynix Inc. and Samsung Electronics only.Analysts’ average earnings per share estimate for MSCI Taiwan has risen more than 33% this year to a record high, while that for MSCI Korea has declined 5% since a peak in August, Bloomberg compiled data shows.“If you think of Nvidia’s AI server market and so on, Taiwan is heavily involved in that value chain,” said Yan Taw Boon, portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. “Conversely, Korea has not performed as strongly as they have very little involvement in this new booming environment.”While the higher tariffs threatened by Trump are a universal challenge, there are reasons some investors believe that Taiwan’s treatment may be more nuanced and less punishing.“One will recall that many Taiwanese exports were exempt from tariffs last time around as they were key components of US tech supply chains,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Rajiv Batra wrote in a note. “This time is likely to be the same with TSMC seen as a major part of the Global AI trade.”The Wall Street bank sees Taiwan relatively better positioned than Korea in a trade war with the US.Another buffer for Taiwanese equities is the growing presence of local investors, especially when the global investment climate turns more capricious.“Taiwan retail investors’ home bias and the still interesting AI ramp-up theme should continue to drive participation in the stock market,” said Vivian Pai, fund manager at Fidelity International. Their increased awareness of long-term investing can help form strong consistent inflows into local stocks, she added.The Taiwan dollar has weakened about 5% against the US currency this year while the Korean won has fallen around 9%.“Both Taiwan and Korea are exposed to tariffs but Taiwan’s underlying economic fundamentals are more solid,” said Eddie Cheung, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “This should persist in 2025.”",Taiwan's market capitalization now exceeds South Korea's by about $950 billion.

Rexas Finance (RXS) has a big vision of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation. By integrating traditional assets with blockchain technology, Rexas Finance creates opportunities for investors to penetrate high-value markets that have been hard to navigate, such as real estate and art. This analysis reviews the possibility of RXS replicating Ripple’s steps to the $2.5 mark and whether it would attract investors during the process.Ripple's popularity stems from its fast, low-cost global payment platform. Currently priced at $2.33, XRP boasts a market capitalisation of $133.6 billion, reflecting strong investor confidence. The coin is still dominant despite its prominent issues with SEC accusations of the company. RippleNet, the company's payment network, gained the confidence of many banks and financial institutions. This reinforces expectations for the future of XRP quite a lot. The investors’ mood is quite optimistic as many think of a positive outcome of the ongoing SEC case, which is likely to create new highs for XRP. Some analysts predict that the price might rise to around $3 only in the short term, while $5 is possible but only if Ripple can penetrate many institutional on-boards and acquire new customers throughout the industry. XRP provides steady growth, but other newer projects, such as Rexas Finance (RXS), which is focused on real-world asset tokenisation and other latest trends within the blockchain industry, are perceived to present opportunities for higher exponential returns.Unlike Ripple, Rexas Finance is focused on revolutionising the investment landscape by bridging conventional assets with blockchain technology. The project enables fractional ownership of high-value assets like real estate, gold, and art, broadening access for more investors. The presale has raised $21 million, selling 292 million RXS tokens out of a total supply of 1 billion. The current Stage 9 presale price of $0.125 marks a significant increase from the initial $0.030 price, reflecting a 320% surge. The next presale stage will sell for $0.15, with substantial growth potential after that. Rexas Finance’s decision to bypass venture capital funding and adopt a community-driven presale model has been a strategic success. This inclusive approach aligns with blockchain’s decentraliz\sation principles, fostering trust and loyalty among early investors.Rexas Finance’s selling point hits the point, showing how they can gain access to huge markets through tokenisation. The real estate industry is said to have a market worth around $379.7 trillion; when it comes to gold or other commodities, the entire segment is valued at $121.2 trillion. There is also room for expansion in the $65 billion annual revenue art market. Rexas Finance unlocks investment opportunities in high-value assets by tokenizing them, making it possible for people to invest in expensive properties and commodities without the usual constraints of high capital requirements. Users of Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad, among other of the platform’s tools, can develop their own tokenised assets and invest in fractionalized shares of luxury objects. This advancement makes it easier for people to hold assets while increasing security, transparency, and reach to users worldwide.Rexas Finance's presale performance, coupled with innovation in the business model, is why it can reach the $2.5 mark after launch. Since the token price is $0.125, this is a win-win situation for early investors who hope to get better rates before the token gets primary exchange listings in early 2025. Another factor that allowed the platform to attract a more extensive investor base is its listing on the CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko platforms. In addition, the $1 million giveaway, promising 20 prizes of 50,000 RXS tokens, generated a lot of buzz and engagement. Hitting the $2.5 target is not just wishful thinking. The combination of Rexas Finance’s existing and future focus on tokenizing global real-world assets and the community-building element will ensure explosive growth. As more and more people use Rexas Finance, and if the platform's innovation trend continues, the $2.5 mark is very much attainable.The price of Ripple (XRP) remains fairly stable for investing purposes, with its offerings revolving around the payments and remittance sector. For investors who want to take on a higher risk and expect better returns, there is Rexas Finance (RXS), which appears worth looking into. The token aims to leverage the growing market of tokenized real-world assets at a community level. It has been focused heavily on its pre-sale activities, giving it much room for growth. Rexas Finance is an exciting investment. It is currently priced at $0.125, but estimates project it to reach $2.5 post-launch. For those wishing to take advantage of the potential within blockchain technology these days, Rexas Finance cannot be overlooked.For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:Website: https://rexas.com Whitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf Twitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance Telegram: https://t.me/rexasfinance","Rexas Finance (RXS) has a big vision of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation.

President-elect Donald Trump’s pick of a crypto proponent to be the next head of the US securities regulator lifted Bitcoin to $100,000 for the first time as traders warmed to the prospect of relaxed regulations.The digital asset rose as much as 6.1% to $103,801 on Thursday before changing hands at $101,968 as of 6:45 am in London. The crypto market overall has jumped by roughly $1.3 trillion since Trump’s election victory on Nov 5 on a platform that includes a tight embrace of the crypto sector.Trump selected Paul Atkins to replace outgoing Securities & Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, who cracked down on digital assets after a 2022 market rout exposed fraudulent practices and sparked costly blowups.“This is a momentum rally,” said Jason Titman, CEO, crypto brokerage Swyftx. “Global spot volumes are above mid-pandemic levels and nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC chair just added to the carnival atmosphere.”On November 22, Bitcoin was less than $300 from achie ving $100,000 but fell back while remaining in sight of the landmark level. Crypto’s adherents view the six-figure number as a validation of controversial claims that Bitcoin is a modern-day store of value and a hedge for inflation risk. For critics, the digital asset lacks any fundamental value and is too exposed to speculative whims.Hitting $100,000 is “a huge milestone for token and crypto industry as a whole,” said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, a provider of liquidity for crypto derivatives. “We expect further momentum for the coming days.”US exchange-traded funds for Bitcoin have attrac ted a net inflow of about $32 billion this year, including over $8 billion since Trump became president-elect, data compiled by Bloomberg sho wed. The combined trading volume for digital assets and related derivatives across centralised exchanges climbed to a record of more than $10 trillion last month, according to CCData.Trump has vowed to undo a Biden administration clampdown on digital assets, install friendly regulators and turn the US into global home of crypto. The Republican even backed idea of strategic national Bitcoin reserve, though there are doubts over whether the latter objective is feasible.","The digital asset rose as much as 6.1% to $103,801 on Thursday before changing hands at $101,968 as of 6:45 am in London.

Another BTC rally is coming, and the meme coin market is already stealing headlines. The latest meme coin in the spotlight is Catslap .The project’s quirky narrative is centred around a feisty feline that slaps anything that gets in its way. The token exploded 1800% on its Uniswap launch , but its market cap is still incredibly low.Could SLAP be the next meme coin to explode? Catslap ($SLAP) introduces a slap-to-earn model that allows investors to earn crypto rewards by slapping their favourite memes. The more they slap, the more they earn, and the more the project burns.As the Slapometer count increases, so does the number of tokens burnt. The reward model has country and user leaderboards.Catslap was launched directly on Uniswap without any presales. The fair launch lays a level playing field for new investors.Aggressive marketing campaigns will go live over the coming weeks to strengthen the community. For those seeking a high-risk, high-reward opportunity, Catslap is a meme coin to watch out now. The $SLAP community has exploded to around 10,000 members onWith the dog coin niche saturated, investors have turned their attention to cat coins. According to CoinMarketCap, cat coins have a total market cap of under $5 billion now. That is incredibly low when compared to dog coins, which boast a market cap of close to $90 billion.The difference underscores the growth potential of the cat coin niche. It is taking off as Popcat (SOL) and Mog Coin (MOG) top the hot lists. For example, Popcat has exploded close to 8000% in a year, while MOG recorded 9000% gains.The problem, however, is that these cat coins are close to hitting their saturation points. MOG is closing in on a $1 billion market cap, and Popcat has already smashed it.Even if they dominate the niche, they don’t have much room left for growth. Not for multifold, explosive price surges.This is where new projects like Catslap enter the picture. Due to their low initial market caps, they are capable of turbocharged surges.For a better context, Catslap’s market cap is just around $10 million now. If it jumps over $100 million, it could yield close to 1000% returns for early investors. For Popcat to deliver similar gains, it would need to cross a staggering $10 billion market cap. Even large meme coins like Pepe hover under the $10 billion point.Catslap just burnt 25 million tokens as part of strengthening its price momentum. Token burns are commonly used in the crypto space to drive a token’s value. They cut down the permanent supply, which, in turn, could positively affect the price.SLAP is an Ethereum-based meme coin. The SLAP tokenomics solidifies the project’s commitment to long-term growth and sustainability.The $SLAP tokenomics focuses on stable and community-driven growth. It gives Catslap an edge over its cat coin competitors.Crypto influencer Austin Hilton, who commands a YouTube community of over 280,000 members, recently featured the project on his channel. He drew attention to the project’s growth potential as a new contender in the cat coin space.The meme coin community is ready to embrace another bull season. Catslap is positioned to pounce on the opportunity. It is too early to tell whether it can replicate the success of Popcat and Mogcoin.Catslap is available for purchase on decentralised exchanges like Uniswap. Investors can also purchase the token directly through Best Wallet, the popular non-custodial wallet.

"Airbus cuts over 2,000 jobs amidst competition from Elon Musk's Starlink",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/airbus-cuts-over-2000-jobs-amidst-competition-from-elon-musks-starlink/articleshow/116002827.cms,"Germany will shoulder the primary burden of workforce reductions with 689 positions.

Airbus job cuts : Airbus has announced approximately 2,000 job cuts in its Defence and Space division, representing 5% of its second-largest unit. The company faces challenges from American competition in satellites, though the job cuts were less extensive than initially indicated by the company.European satellite manufacturers, traditionally specialising in sophisticated geostationary spacecraft, have struggled against the emergence of cost-effective small satellites in low Earth orbit, particularly due to the rapid expansion of "" Elon Musk 's Starlink constellation"".The Space Systems business will bear the majority of the 2,043 position cuts, with 1,128 roles affected following significant satellite-related losses. The European aerospace organisation confirmed there would be no forced redundancies.Germany will shoulder the primary burden of workforce reductions with 689 positions, whilst France faces 540 cuts, Britain 477, Spain 303, and other peripheral nations 34, according to a Reuters report.The establishment of Airbus by these four nations over five decades ago makes the distribution of workforce reductions a delicate political matter.France hosts Airbus's main headquarters and primary jetliner production, whilst Germany oversees defence and space operations. Spain manages military transport aircraft assembly, and Britain specialises in satellite payloads and communications systems.Airbus, which manufactures satellites, transporters and holds significant stakes in European missile, fighter and space-launch initiatives, issued a statement after Reuters disclosed the job cuts during union briefings regarding an efficiency assessment.Following October's announcement of potential cuts of up to 2,500 positions (7% of workforce) due to €1.5 billion in satellite-related writedowns, particularly affecting OneSat, Airbus has now detailed specific reductions: 250 positions in Air Power, 47 in Connected Intelligence, and 618 posts at divisional headquarters.These reductions are distinct from "" Project Bromo "", a proposed merger of Airbus, Thales and Leonardo's satellite operations to enhance competitiveness against Starlink. Both initiatives reflect efforts to strengthen Europe's space sector against mounting competition.The implementation of these job cuts, scheduled for completion by mid-2026, primarily targets administrative and management positions rather than operational roles, focusing on reducing overhead and fixed expenses.The governments of the founding nations, including France and Germany each holding 11% ownership, have received briefings about these reductions, which form part of the Proton reorganisation initiative.The proposed staff reductions constitute roughly 5% of the division's workforce, according to Airbus. This percentage suggests a slight increase in divisional staff numbers this year, as the cuts represent 6% of the reported workforce at end-2023.France's Thales, which maintains two collaborative ventures with Italy's Leonardo in satellites and services, is currently discussing plans with unions regarding 1,300 space-related position reductions.","Airbus has announced approximately 2,000 job cuts in its Defence and Space division, representing 5% of its second-largest unit.

"Afghan economy shows modest signs of growth but recovery remains fragile, says World Bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/afghan-economy-shows-modest-signs-of-growth-but-recovery-remains-fragile-says-world-bank/articleshow/115998852.cms,"Image credit: AP

Afghanistan's economy is showing modest signs of growth after two years of severe contraction, the World Bank said.In its latest development update issued late Wednesday, the financial institution said modest GDP growth of 2.7% was driven by private consumption. The partial recovery, coupled with falling food prices, helped to gradually improve household welfare.Before the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, Afghanistan's economy relied heavily on foreign aid and corruption was rife. Their takeover three years ago sent the economy into a tailspin, as billions in international funds were frozen, and tens of thousands of highly skilled Afghans fled the country and took their money with them.Afghan's exports remained stable in 2023-24 but imports surged, creating a widening trade deficit, according to the World Bank. This deficit, exacerbated by dependence on imports for essential goods like fuel, food and machinery, could pose a risk to the country's economic stability.Faris Hadad-Zervos, the World Bank's country director for Afghanistan, said long-term growth prospects required tapping into the substantial potential of the domestic private sector and improving the overall business environment.""Key to this is increased investment, providing access to finance to small businesses, and supporting educated and skilled women entrepreneurs so their businesses can thrive,"" said Hadad-Zervos. ""Without this, the country risks prolonged stagnation with limited prospects for sustainable development.""The update comes days after media reports that the Taliban have ordered educational institutions to stop providing medical training to women and girls. The Taliban have neither confirmed the order nor responded to the reports.On Thursday, the head of the UN children's agency Unicef said she was deeply alarmed by the reported restrictions.Unicef was determining the veracity of these differing accounts and welcomed efforts to address the issue, said the agency's executive director Catherine Russell.If confirmed, this ban was expected to immediately halt the medical education of thousands of women and jeopardize women and girls' access to health care, she added.""It would not only further limit the ability of women to contribute to society and earn an income but would also have far-reaching consequences for the health of the Afghan population. Lives would be lost,"" she warned.","Afghanistan's economy is showing modest signs of growth after two years of contraction.

However, China's share in Pakistan's total external debt went down to 22 per cent compared to 25 per cent in 2023 with Saudi Arabia increasing its share from 2 per cent in 2023 to 7 per cent in 2024.The World Bank's International Debt Report 2024 released on Tuesday ranks Pakistan among the top three loan recipients from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this year and also notes that Pakistan's high debt-to-export and debt-to-revenue ratios indicate a weakening fiscal position.The International Debt Report 2024 put Pakistan's total external debt (including that from IMF) at $ 130.85 billion in 2023, accounting for 352 per cent of its total exports and 39 per cent of gross national income (GNI) while Pakistan's total external debt servicing amounted to 43 per cent of total exports and 5 per cent of GNI.As per the 2023 edition of the report, Pakistan's total external debt (including that from IMF) was at $ 126.95 billion in 2023, accounting for 320 per cent of its total exports and 34 per cent of gross national income (GNI) while Pakistan's total external debt servicing amounted to 42 per cent of total exports and 4 per cent of GNI.According to the 2024 report, China had the single largest share of debt to Pakistan at 22 per cent share (about $ 28.786 billion), followed by World Bank's 18 per cent share ($ 23.55 billion) and Asian Development Bank's 15 per cent share ($ 19.63 billion).Saudi Arabia stood out as the second largest bilateral lender to Pakistan with 7 per cent of total debt or about $ 9.16 billion.Of the total external debt stock, about 45 per cent debt ($ 58.88 billion) belonged to the bilateral lenders and 46 per cent (about $ 60.2 billion) to multilaterals, while remaining 9 per cent debt belonged to private lenders led by bondholders with 8 per cent chunk, the 2024 report said.It further noted that of the total $ 130.85 bn, long-term external debt stocks stood at $ 110.44 billion; $ 11.53 billion was IMF credit and allocations and $ 8.878 billion was short-term external debt.According to newspaper Dawn, the financial strain was fiercest for the poorest and most vulnerable countries - those eligible to borrow from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA). These countries paid a record $ 96.2 billion to service their debt in 2023, the data showed.For some countries, the payments run as high as 38 per cent of export earnings but Pakistan even surpassed this landmark as its interest payments stood at 43 per cent of exports, it said, adding, Pakistan made the second-largest interest payments in South Asia while the interest payment by Bangladesh and India increased by more than 90 per cent in 2023, highest in the region.In September, Minister of State for Finance Ali Pervaiz Malik told a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee that Pakistan was facing a daunting task of repaying a staggering $ 100 billion external debt over the next four years, an amount which is nearly 10 times its current $ 9.4 billion foreign exchange reserves.The $ 100 billion external debt repayments from 2024 to 2027 are exclusive of any payments on account of the liabilities booked at the balance sheet of the central bank and the requirements for financing the current account deficitMeanwhile, the Pakistan government on Monday admitted that there are ""hiccups"" in implementing the IMF programme, but asserted its commitment to completing the $ 7 billion package.",World Bank's International Debt Report 2024 ranks Pakistan among the top three loan recipients from the International Monetary Fund.

As crypto is firmly in bull market territory, now is the time to stack up on altcoins. A new project, Cutoshi, currently in presale, is gaining a lot of traction.Bitcoin has essentially been adopted by mainstream finance, meaning that it will not go to 0, despite the 477 ‘Bitcoin obituaries’ in the past. Many ‘experts’ are now publishing articles about why they were wrong about BTC.As long as the bull market continues, BTC should keep going up, but it will be outperformed by many smaller-cap coins.Considering that Ethereum, like Bitcoin, has had a Spot ETF, the price action this year has been disappointing. As Bitcoin makes all-time highs, ETH is struggling to get close to its ATH of $4,878, and is currently trading at around $3,451.According to DeFiLlama, over 63% of all decentralized finance and money locked (TVL) is stored on Ethereum. Many Layer 2 blockchains are built upon it that use ETH as a gas token, such as Arbitrum.With the new pro-crypto administration coming in, it looks as though the issue of ETH being a potential security is over. Another benefit is that ETH staking rewards can potentially be integrated into the ETF returns, making Ethereum Spot ETFs more attractive for institutional investors.Known as the Ethereum killer, Solana is considered to be Etheruem’s rival. It’s built with a different coding language and offers fast speeds and low fees. Solana became the chain of choice for many meme coins since the launch of the easy-to-use meme coin deployer Pump.fun.Solana is likely to be the next coin to receive a Spot ETF, with applications from asset managers Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares and Canary Capital.If Solana can grow as big as ETH is now, then that's room for 3.74x growth, as we can see from the picture below:Image from MarketCapOf If Solana grows as big as ETH did in the last bull run, that's a SOL price of $1,205.26 (5.15x).While the previous coins are the three biggest in all crypto, in terms of market cap and overall adoption, every portfolio, especially a crypto one, needs a small-cap coin with a lot of potential.Cutoshi is a cat-based meme coin with a devoted community.

After the U.S. Election Day on November 5, Ripple's XRP has been causing waves in the crypto market with an amazing price rise. At $1.89 right now, XRP has tripled from its pre-election value. Today's major question– how high can XRP go before Trump's inauguration in January? The market is responding favorably to the political and legal changes linked to his presidency.The cryptocurrency market depends on sentiment, speculation, and legislative changes– all of which have driven XRP's recent price surge. Since November 5, the coin has profited from growing investor confidence, most likely inspired by Donald Trump's triumph and the expected legislative change supporting digital assets. XRP has tripled its value in less than a month, providing strong upward momentum. The announced departure of Gary Gensler, the SEC Chair, set for Trump's inauguration day, is a major component driving this surge. Particularly for currencies like XRP that have been under regulatory scrutiny in the past, Gensler's leaving is a positive development for the cryptocurrency scene. Gensler's resignation has market players looking forward to a softer regulatory environment under the next government.Market experts are positive regarding XRP's future for even more expansion before Trump's inauguration. Some forecasts indicate XRP might surpass the $5 level, particularly if the present positive attitude continues. Strong technical indications, past trends, and rising trade volumes are our estimate's foundation. More speculative predictions, though, have XRP rising to $15 following the inauguration. Although these forecasts are interesting, they are somewhat speculative and depend on several elements, including regulation changes, more general market trends, and Ripple's capacity to find new alliances or increase its usage. Rexas Finance (RXS) is another coin quietly taking the front stage as XRP rides the wave of optimistic feelings. With its real-world asset tokenizing features, RXS is emerging as a revolutionary force in the crypto sector. It is primed to soar even bigger than XRP before Trump's inauguration.With just one click, Rexas Finance lets consumers purchase, sell, and fractionalize real-world assets, including real estate, artwork, and intellectual property. This special use case makes RXS a game-changer since it provides countless options for investors looking for exposure to real assets in the digital environment. As of writing, Rexas Finance (RXS) is priced at $0.10 and has already raised an outstanding $19.95 million. It is currently in its eighth presale round. The coin's presale has shown amazing enthusiasm; its price has tripled from the first stage. This path reflects the recent performance of XRP, but with a major difference: RXS is still in its presale phase, so it has great growth capacity.With a stunning 19,900% return from its present price, top market analysts estimate RXS might surge to $20 before Trump takes office. With this expansion far higher than XRP's possible returns, RXS appeals to investors trying to profit from the continuous crypto surge. Rexas Finance represents a revolution and is not only a symbol. With unparalleled access and flexibility, the platform lets consumers tokenize almost any real-world asset. From anywhere globally, RXS lets everyone engage in the tokenized economy, whether their participation is full ownership or fractional investment.Although the recent price surge of XRP has made news, Rexas Finance (RXS) presents a convincing substitute with better profits. Although XRP gains from market mood and regulatory confidence, its rise is mostly related to macroeconomic events and Ripple's continuous legal conflicts. By merging blockchain technology with actual asset tokenization, RXS offers a fresh horizon in cryptocurrencies. Its ambitious roadmap and presale success suggest that it may outpace XRP in terms of acceptance and expansion. With forecasts of a 19,900% increase before Trump's inauguration, RXS offers early investors potentially life-changing rewards.In conclusion, XRP and Rexas Finance (RXS) are among the best candidates as the crypto market moves into a new phase of hope and possibilities. XRP’s price surge reflects renewed investor confidence and regulatory optimism, while RXS offers a groundbreaking use case with unparalleled growth potential. XRP provides a relatively stable option with strong market momentum, while RXS offers the chance to get in on the ground floor of a revolutionary project poised for exponential growth.For more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:Website: https://rexas.com Win $1 Million Giveaway: https://bit.ly/Rexas1M Whitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf Twitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance","Ripple's XRP has been causing waves in the crypto market with an amazing price rise.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says. Udaan competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods. The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-105001128,imgsize-151312,width-400,resizemode-4/105001128.jpg"

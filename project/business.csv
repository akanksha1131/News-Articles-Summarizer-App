He urged banks to ensure that grievances are properly addressed and escalated to internal ombudsmen when necessary, highlighting the importance of robust redress mechanisms. ""We have come across instances of rejected grievances not being escalated to the internal ombudsman of banks. I would like to urge the boards and their customer service committees to closely look into these aspects to ensure that banks have a genuine commitment to customer centricity,"" he added.Das emphasised that banks must adopt a genuine customer-centric approach and move beyond profit-driven motives. ""Boards should give a close look at service charges and penalties when they are treated as avenues of profit or when forced bundling of products is done, or when disclosures to customers are non-transparent or selective. Ensuring fair lending practices and implementing robust grievance redress systems are critical to protecting customers' interests,"" Das said.The governor noted that issues like forced bundling of products and non-transparent service charges need immediate attention from the board-level committees. ""Service charges and penalties should not be treated as avenues of profit,"" he cautioned, stressing the need for fair lending practices.RBI, on Monday, held its second annual conference with over 200 directors from private banks, including chairmen, MDs, and CEOs. RBI deputy governors M Rajeshwar Rao, Swaminathan J, and senior officials from the supervision, regulation, and enforcement departments were also present.The governor pointed out gaps in financial literacy, particularly among rural and marginalised populations, who are often susceptible to exploitative lending practices. He urged banks to enhance their outreach and education efforts to protect these vulnerable groups. He concluded by calling for stronger governance and ethical conduct from banks, warning that unethical practices, such as misselling products, could lead to long-term reputational damage and regulatory scrutiny.",RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has criticised private banks for mishandling customer grievances.

‘Work-life balance is controversial but...’: What Wipro’s Rishad Premji has to say days after Narayana Murthy reiterates 70-hour work week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/work-life-balance-is-controversial-but-what-wipros-rishad-premji-has-to-say-days-after-narayana-murthy-reiterates-70-hour-work-week/articleshow/115484494.cms,"Rishad Premji’s comments come days after Infosys founder Narayana Murthy reaffirmed his position supporting a 70-hour work-week.

Work-life balance has become a frequently discussed subject lately, with Wipro executive chairman Rishad Premji acknowledging its significance as ""incredibly important"" whilst recognising it as a ""controversial subject"". He maintains that corporate hybrid working arrangements benefit employees.Rishad Premji’s comments come days after Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy reaffirmed his position supporting a 70-hour work-week and expressed concern about India's transition from six-day to five-day workweeks in 1986, whilst rejecting the notion of work-life balance.Post-Covid, whilst Indian IT services companies adopted hybrid working arrangements, organisations like TCS, Infosys and Wipro have increasingly requested office attendance. However, many firms maintain flexibility.Speaking at the Bengaluru Tech Summit 2024, the Wipro group promoter said, ""Work-life balance is incredibly important. I learned this very early on in my early days before Covid, which is work life is something that you have to define for yourself, organizations are never going to work at it for you. So you have to define what it means and draw boundaries.""Also Read | When Narayana Murthy touched Ratan Tata’s feet Premji noted that the understanding of work-life has evolved significantly. Previously, it centered on office arrival and departure times, whereas now it might involve considerations such as managing ""Instagram access at work.""""The concept of what it means is simply not ours, it is also the freedom of what I can do with my time while at work, but not working,"" Premji elaborated.Premji said, ""The one model that IT industry has adopted, and I think the government has been supportive of is a more hybrid model of work. It is a controversial subject. But we, as a company, have said, we won't be able to come three days a week, but we want you to have the flexibility of having two days on your work place. That certainly helps with the workforce.""Addressing employee mental health and work-life balance, Premji noted the positive development of companies openly discussing these previously taboo subjects, particularly following the 2020 pandemic.He highlighted Wipro's initiative to train managers in recognising signs and conducting open discussions sensitively with staff.

(AI image)

Gold Loan EMIs: Following RBI 's identification of gaps in gold loan disbursements by banks and lending institutions, the sector is looking to start monthly amortisation schemes. The regulated bodies may require borrowers to start interest and principal payments through EMIs immediately upon loan approval. Additionally, lenders are considering term loan alternatives for gold-backed lending.On September 30, the RBI highlighted irregularities in lending against gold ornaments and jewellery. The central bank discovered issues in loan sourcing, valuation, diligence procedures, end-use monitoring, auction transparency, LTV ratio oversight, and risk weight application. The practice of rolling over gold loans with partial payments was deemed inadequate.""The regulator's diktat is clear, it wants lenders to examine the payment capacity of borrowers and not solely rely on the collateral,"" a senior banking official told ET. ""It is also unhappy with allowing rollover of such loans with part payment, which could lead to some delinquencies when repayments come up. We are now structuring monthly payment options for gold loans.""Currently, gold loan providers offer bullet repayment options, allowing borrowers to settle the entire amount at tenure end without EMI commitments.Alternatively, borrowers can make flexible partial repayments when funds are available, settling the complete principal and interest before the loan matures.This directive follows substantial growth in gold loan portfolios across banks and NBFCs recently. Crisil reports that bank-issued retail loans against gold jewellery grew 37% between April and August, coinciding with rising gold prices. Gold-loan-focused NBFCs recorded 11% growth in assets under management in Q1 FY25.""The sector faces underlying challenges as the continuous build-up of leverage raises concerns about borrowers' ability to service debt, especially given limited visibility into their cash flows or for that matter the end use of funds,"" said Prakash Agarwal, partner at consulting firm Gefion Capital.""A potential correction in gold prices could pose significant risks, as declining collateral values might create refinancing challenges and strain repayment capacity. Lenders must remain vigilant, balancing growth with prudent risk management to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.""As of September 30, banks' jewellery loan disbursements reached Rs 1.4 lakh crore, showing 51% growth compared to 14.6% in the previous year.Recent quarters have seen substantial growth in gold loans, supported by increased gold prices enabling additional top-ups on existing collateral. Limited access to unsecured and microfinance loans drove more borrowers towards gold loans. However, RBI's recent review highlighting inconsistencies and emphasis on stronger controls may moderate this growth.","The regulated bodies may require borrowers to start interest and principal payments through EMIs immediately upon loan approval.

Gautam Adani charged by US over alleged $250 million bribe plot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gautam-adani-charged-by-us-over-alleged-250-million-bribe-plot/articleshow/115507022.cms,"Prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, alleged on Wednesday that Adani and other defendants lied about the plan as they sought to raise money from US investors.

Extradition treaty

SEC Lawsuit

Sagar Adani

US prosecutors charged Gautam Adani with helping drive a $250 million bribery scheme, threatening to throw the Indian tycoon’s conglomerate back into turmoil just as it rebounded from a short-seller’s fraud allegations.Federal prosecutors alleged on Wednesday that Adani, one of the world’s richest people, and other defendants promised to pay more than $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to win solar energy contracts, and concealed the plan as they sought to raise money from US investors. The five-count indictment also accuses Gautam’s nephew Sagar R Adani and Vneet S Jaain, both executives at an Indian renewable-energy company, of breaking federal laws.“The defendants orchestrated an elaborate scheme to bribe Indian government officials to secure contracts worth billions of dollars,” Breon Peace, US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York which brought the case, said in a statement. US law allows federal prosecutors to pursue foreign corruption allegations if they involve certain links to American investors or markets.Requests for comment to a representative for Adani Group ’s US offices weren’t immediately returned. Lawyers for Sagar Adani and Jaain didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. None of the defendants have been taken into custody.In addition to being a monolithic presence in India, with ports, airports, power lines and highway developments, Adani Group attracts capital from around the world.Prosecuting the case would take months, if not years, meaning that it will fall to the incoming Trump administration’s Justice Department to determine how to proceed. Peace, the Brooklyn US attorney who was appointed during the Biden administration, is expected to step down and be replaced by whomever Donald Trump picks to lead the office, which is known as EDNY.Neither a White House press official nor a representative for the Trump transition team immediately responded to emailed requests seeking comment.Although the US and India have an extradition treaty, it’s likely that India would fight to protect its citizens from being forced to stand trial in the US. If convicted the defendants could face years behind bars, prosecutors said on Wednesday.Beyond the Justice Department investigation, Adani has been dealing with claims from short-seller Hindenburg Research that the conglomerate manipulated its stock price and committed accounting fraud. The group has vigorously denied those allegations and its shares climbed back from their initial plunge caused by the report.After also initially cratering on the short-seller’s claims, Gautam Adani’s fortune has rebounded as well. He’s the world’s 18th richest person with more than $85.5 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Separately, units of the conglomerate’s clean-energy arm sold a 20-year green dollar bond earlier on Wednesday in an offering that was oversubscribed.Prosecutors on Wednesday charged four of the eight defendants with conspiring to obstruct justice by deleting electronic evidence and lying to representatives of the Justice Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and FBI.The SEC, which is a civil law enforcement agency, provided detailed allegations against both Adanis and another one of the co-defendants, Cyril Sebastien Dominique Cabanes, in a parallel lawsuit. The regulator identified the firm involved in the alleged bribery scheme, which wasn’t named in the indictment, as Adani Green Energy Ltd.According to the regulator, Gautam Adani spearheaded an effort to pay or promise hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to Indian state government officials to induce them to enter contracts that Adani Green needed to develop India’s largest solar power plant project. Another company involved in the power plant project, Azure Power Global Ltd, agreed to pay some of the bribes, the SEC alleged.In its lawsuit, the SEC said Cabanes served as a director on the board at Azure Power Global and as a representative of the company’s largest stockholder, pension fund company Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, which is known as CDPQ. While serving as a director, Cabanes, and others, “schemed” to make payments to bribe state government officials in India, the SEC said in its lawsuit.A lawyer listed by the SEC as representing Cabanes didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for Azure Power Global didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside of normal business hours.“CDPQ is aware of charges filed in the US against certain former employees,” a spokesperson for the pension manager said by email. “Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is cooperating with US authorities.”US authorities ramped up an existing probe into Adani Group by looking into the conduct of the company’s billionaire founder, Bloomberg reported in March. Officials were focused on whether there were improper payments made to officials in India for favorable treatment on an energy project.","Prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, alleged on Wednesday that Adani and other defendants lied about the plan as they sought to raise money from US investors.

The founder of bankrupt Indian tech firm Byju’s tried to use loan proceeds that he allegedly hid from US lenders to secretly buy back a software company that was taken over by an American trustee, according to a new court filing.Byju Raveendran has been trying to regain control of his capsizing education technology empire, which is under court supervision in both India, where the parent is based, and the US, where some of its valuable units are located, according to a court declaration filed by Nebraska businessman William R Hailer.Raveendran allegedly recruited Hailer, who is a former political consultant, to try to buy out US creditors owed more than $1.2 billion under a loan, according to the filing with the US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. Raveendran could then swap that debt, which was trading at about 0.24 cents on the dollar as of Wednesday evening, for ownership of Epic! , a education-software firm. The plan ultimately failed.“Over the last several months I have been used as a pawn in Byju’s manipulation of the law,” Hailer wrote in his testimony. Hailer is set to testify in federal court on Thursday on behalf of a trustee, which is planning to sell Epic! in order to raise money for Byju’s creditors, including US lenders.A representative of Byju’s and a lawyer for Raveendran did not return requests for comment.Raveendran has denied wrongdoing in past responses to lender allegations, saying his actions were a justified response to overly aggressive tactics used by creditors who specialize in squeezing money out of distressed companies.This summer, when Hailer began negotiating with lenders, Raveendran wired $11.25 million to a company that Hailer ran called Rose Lake Inc. Hailer was supposed to use the cash to prove to lenders that he was well funded. The money was then to be returned to Raveendran, Hailer said.The money came from OCI Ltd, a UK-incorporated logistics firm that received hundreds of millions of dollars in loan proceeds that US lenders have been trying to reclaim, according Hailer’s court filing.Hailer said he tried unsuccessfully to gather proof that OCI was still holding money on behalf of Byju’s, even though Raveendran has claimed all the cash has been spent. For several months, Hailer said he regularly spoke with Raveendran and other Indian business people involved in the Byju’s empire. Hailer also visited Raveendran’s family compound in Dubai for talks with investors who were allegedly backing Raveendran’s effort to regain control of Byju’s.Lenders have been fighting Byju’s in both US state and federal courts for more than a year. Lenders claim Raveendran hid $533 million in loan proceeds that should have been repaid to creditors. In India, Byju’s is facing an insolvency proceeding, where a court-appointed professional has been tasked with raising money to repay lenders.The case is Epic!

Railway Budget 2024 : The government has wavered little in its efforts to spur a modernisation of railways in the country, pivoting on technology, to support the country’s economic ambitions. In line with expectations, Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore, marking yet another year of successive increase in outlay. That takes forward the past policies and the government’s vision, which have paved the way for modernisation of the transport behemoth.In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. That was the need of the hour back then and has helped set up the base for a larger transformation.For instance, the massive Dedicated Freight Corridor ( DFC ) as well as locomotive factories at Marhaura and Madhepura in Bihar were conceptualised over a decade ago and we are seeing their completion now.More recently, the focus has shifted to modernisation—of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.This year, emphasis has also been laid on the railways’ crucial role in industrial development. Commodity-specific corridors have been planned in eastern India and impetus given to port connectivity. Vande Bharat and technology-led upgrades in rolling stock remain in focus. Safety has been prioritised through budgetary allocations for the anti-collision systemKavach . That said, there are other cogs in the wheel that demand attention from a long-term perspective.First, the target for the Operating Ratio, the crucial efficiency gauge, has been set at 98.22% for 2024-25, compared with 98.65% in 2023-24. This reflects an imminent need for operational transformation. An effective overhaul of the world’s fourth-largest rail network will take many years and thus we need to start focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs now.DFC is almost entirely operational and will be complete over the next few months. To ensure the project achieves its twin goals of reducing logistics costs and enhancing freight efficiency, railways need to attract more cargo on the corridor. This will help increase the rail coefficient and make the railways’ approach more market-oriented, which will in turn aid future corridors.A revamp of railway stations is on track, with sufficient funds dedicated to this end. But even though new coaches and wagons are increasingly being added to meet footfalls, the stations and passenger trains themselves remain synonymous with chaos.Just as safety, comfort and convenience have been prioritised, there is a need for solutions to address the capacity and demand challenges. As a first step, the government could target development of new stations and setting up of new coach production units.As a leading freight mover, Indian Railways carried a record 1,588 MT cargo in fiscal 2024, up from 1,095 MT in fiscal 2015. It accounts for 26% of the cargo moved in the country—by no means an easy feat. The railways aims to take this volume to 3,000 MT by 2030, which would require a 11% CAGR against the around 4.2% witnessed over the last 10 years. As per a report by TERI and Shakti Foundation, from carrying about 62% of freight traffic in 1990-91, Indian Railways’ share has declined to ~27% in 2014-15. This has been due to the expanding road network, cost competitiveness over railways, and door-to-door service. Thus, commencing the cycle of increasing the rail share again is commendable.DFCs, a high-capacity track network, high-power locomotives and improvement in wagon designs have set the ball rolling for larger capacity, faster freight trains that deliver better efficiency.Yet, achieving exponential growth is a tall ask given the current dynamics. Possibly, similar challenges might apply to other goals the railways might have for 2047.To be fair, despite its scale and complexity, Indian Railways has been able to achieve diverse developments at commendable speed.But the track ahead is long and it is time to start discussing the reinvention of the institutional set-up.Indian Railways sees substantial private sector involvement in the form of vendors and contractors. Policymakers could start mulling extreme options such as parallel privately-owned and operated railway infrastructure, coupled with centralised planning and an evolved role for the railways. This will need a robust policy framework from the Government of India.The time is perhaps also ripe to bring user charge and asset monetisation-driven segments for passengers as well as cargo to the discussion table. Globally, the separation of infrastructure and operations in railways has delivered mixed results, for example in the United Kingdom. The model should be analysed and revisited to understand its potential relevance in the Indian context.The key would be to retrace our steps and align our long-term goals to identify not just incremental changes but also ways to explore bold and path-breaking alternatives that put Indian Railways on a smooth track and bring it up to speed.","Union Budget 2024-25 set the capex for railways at a record Rs 2.65 lakh crore. In earlier decades, the government had focused on laying tracks on new routes, electrification and incremental rolling stock capacity addition. The focus has shifted to modernisation of rolling stock and safety systems, among other aspects.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112317825,imgsize-144990,width-400,resizemode-4/112317825.jpg"

Budget 2024 capital gains tax changes: The Narendra Modi government is considering suggestions for tweaks in the new long term capital gains tax regime that was announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman in Union Budget 2024.The July 23 budget reduced the LTCG tax on property from 20% to 12.5%. The indexation benefit, which allowed taxpayers to adjust the acquisition cost for inflation before calculating capital gains and thus reduce their tax liability, is proposed to be eliminated for properties purchased on or after April 1, 2001. The government publishes the Cost Inflation Index (CII) annually for this calculation.India Inc is appealing to the government for a gradual shift to the long-term capital gains tax regime proposed in the FY25 budget, which aims to eliminate indexation benefits for property, gold, and other unlisted assets.According to an ET report by Deepshikha Sikarwar, the industry is suggesting alternatives such as a higher tax rate with indexation or a lower rate of 12.5% without indexation, as well as some form of grandfathering for ancestral properties.The finance ministry is currently reviewing these proposals and will discuss them with the Prime Minister's Office.

Budget 2024 for manufacturing sector : The recent Union Budget has struck a balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulating economic growth. While the middle class has been offered tax relief, the government's primary focus remains on judicious spending to maximize economic impact. The budget's core themes are employment, skilling, MSME development, and support for the middle class.Largely focus has remained intact on spending money judiciously to ensure that each penny spent creates a ripple effect in the entire economic landscape.Although at first glance, manufacturing might appear to have taken a backseat, a deeper analysis reveals a multifaceted approach to bolstering the sector. Initiatives like employment-linked benefits and internship programs, while primarily aimed at job creation and skill development, indirectly benefit manufacturing companies by expanding the talent pool.Extensive focus on the MSME manufacturing units by way of extending term loan facility for purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, would help companies in augmenting their capital base/ capacity and strengthen the very foundation of the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Development of a new credit-assessment model by Public Sector Banks to assess MSME credit shall provide much needed regulatory relief to the units.With respect to the large manufacturing entities, while there is no direct fiscal/ tax incentive introduced in this budget, some support has been provided with an extensive focus on development of ‘industrial parks’ in nearly 100 cities under the ‘plug and play’ model. Reforms proposed with respect to land administration, planning and management, shall also ease out acquisition related difficulties often faced by entrepreneurs/ business houses in acquiring lands for manufacturing set-ups.Targeted Customs duty interventions like, rationalization of Customs duty provisions in Mobile phone manufacturing setups, extension of Customs duty exemption on import of capital goods for manufacturing of solar cells and panels, full Customs duty exemption on import of 25 critical minerals,, shall provide the required impetus for enhancing domestic manufacturing environment.Governments’ focus on formulating an Economic Policy Framework to set the scope for next-gen reforms in the country, has a target to improve the productivity of factors of production, namely, land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship and technology. This shall pave the way for enabling achievement of a target of 25% manufacturing sector contribution to the nation’s GDP over the course of next 7-10 years.While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.The country’s manufacturing base is expanding as is reflective from the continuously increasing tax collections and expanding Purchasing Manager’s Index. It would be pertinent to see how the ground realities evolve vis-à-vis the vision envisaged, in the upcoming Financial Year.","While the overall outlook is positive, the extension of tax benefits under Section 115BAB for manufacturing entities and the absence of new PLI schemes are notable omissions.

Budget 2024: Armed with the vision to propel India to become a developed country by 2047, the Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative and ease of doing business thereby providing the required stimulus to the manufacturing sector and enabling large scale job creation.On the Indirect tax front, the industry welcomes the much-needed announcement for a comprehensive review of the rate structure under Customs enabling ease in product classification and dispute reduction. The proposal of lowering of Customs duty on a plethora of raw materials and products including solar cells, critical minerals and bullion are encouraging measures. The rationale behind such reduction clearly indicates support towards domestic manufacturing, deepening value addition and supporting targets in reducing carbon footprint.Relevant amendments under the Customs law have been made to provide increased time limits for re-imports and re-exports to enhance competitiveness of the fledgling MRO sector. The government has extended significant duty reduction and exemption benefits to the healthcare and electronics sectors, continuing the impetus of incentives provided under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Since their introduction in March 2020, the PLI schemes have indeed supported in revitalizing the manufacturing sector and strengthening the necessary supply chains. The success achieved in the mobile manufacturing sector has now enabled the Government to reduce customs duties on mobile phones and components, signalling a mature environment. The Budget proposals aim at reproducing similar outcomes for semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry by increasing the budgetary allocation.Buoyed by the increasing revenue collection under GST signalling a shift towards a mature tax regime, this Budget has harmonized the timeframes for the issuance of demand notices and adjudication orders for cases involving fraud, suppression or otherwise. Significant amendments to the GST legislations have been introduced reflecting the recommendations proposed by the GST Council such as regularizing non-levy of GST due to general practice which may turn out to be a breather for certain impacted industries reeling under huge tax demands.The Insurance sector has been provided much relief through the GST council recommendations which have been cemented in the present budget thereby ending long standing disputes on their business practices.The Government's efforts to push forward with its reform agenda are evident as plans to incentivize states for their business reform actions plans and digitalization through the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 is proposed. Further, setting up of e-commerce export hubs is envisaged to facilitate easier access to international markets for domestic players.The recent implementation of Budget proposals allows the government to maintain momentum in its reform agenda. These policy measures implicitly reaffirm the significance of India Inc as a crucial element in the development of infrastructure. However, there are still some expectations required to be met to march towards a Viksit Bharat 2047.","Union Budget 2024 aims to focus largely towards strengthening the Make in India initiative.

Budget 2024 : Real estate, a significant contributor to employment generation, has received a fair bit of attention in Budget 2024-25. Recent years have seen the sector transform rapidly, driven by factors such as favourable government policies, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, strong economic growth and changing consumer preferences.Added to that, the budgetary focus on job creation, skilling and employment-linked incentives, infrastructure, urban development, rural connectivity, digitalisation and land-related norms, all dovetail to promote growth of the sector.Launched in June 2015, the PMAY aims to provide affordable housing to all eligible beneficiaries. The budget unveiled PMAY Urban 2.0, under which the housing needs of 1 crore urban poor and middle class will be addressed with an investment of Rs 10 lakh crore.The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.Such an approach can play an important role in realising the government's vision of Housing for All and push growth and development. Hence, the significant investment under PMAY Urban 2.0 is expected to alleviate urban housing deficits, spurring construction and economic growth.Steps to introduce technological reforms within the regulatory framework for land, such as digitalisation or GIS mapping of land records, will improve transparency.Rationalisation of stamp duty across states will also be critical to bring in uniformity and initiate land-related reforms such as urban planning, usage and building bylaws.These are steps in the right direction and will boost growth. Moreover, they will improve the ease of property transactions and strengthen municipal finances through increased property taxes. Rationalization of stamp duty with an emphasis on women homebuyers may boost home-buyer sentiment in major cities, too.The budget has also given ample attention to urban and rural development, with rental housing for industrial workers through the public private partnership model, interest subsidies for rental housing, and transit-oriented developments.The proposal to develop investment-ready plug-and-play industrial parks in 100 cities may attract industrial investment, leading to increased demand for industrial real estate and support the growth of ancillary services and residential developments in these regions.Initiatives for industrial parks and rental housing for industrial workers align with the country’s manufacturing goals and addresses worker accommodation needs.These steps are expected to promote industrial growth and stability in labour-intensive sectors, while also creating new opportunities for real estate developers specialising in rental and affordable housing.The changes in long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, however, have evoked a mixed reaction. The government lowered the long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 12.5%, which is a welcome step. However, this came with the removal of the indexation benefit.The changes could encourage more liquidity in property transactions and potentially increase the effective tax burden depending on the property’s acquisition date.The launch of Phase IV of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana in 25,000 rural habitations will improve connectivity in rural areas, promoting rural development and making these regions more accessible for investment. The primary objective of PMGSY is to build robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations. This initiative focuses on enhancing connectivity and supporting economic development in rural areas.In essence, the budget is geared towards stimulating growth and investment in the real estate sector , fostering a more transparent and investor-friendly environment, and contributing to overall development. It aims to create a balanced and inclusive growth environment by addressing the needs of various segments, including affordable housing, industrial workers and urban infrastructure.The effectiveness of the initiatives, however, hinges on their implementation and continued support of complementary reforms.",The central government’s additional Rs 2.2 lakh crore injection in the next 5 years to make housing more affordable has the potential to revitalise the affordable housing market.

New Budget 2024 rule: Why Income Tax Department is likely to issue a huge number of tax notices this month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-budget-2024-rule-why-income-tax-department-is-likely-to-issue-a-huge-number-of-tax-notices-this-month/articleshow/112186079.cms,"Taxing Times

Income Tax Notice on the way? The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month, as there are concerns that many taxpayers might escape the tax net due to the impending implementation of the new reassessment law on September 1, 2024.According to the amended regulation announced in Budget 2024 , the tax authorities can only go back a maximum of five years to reassess a taxpayer's records if the escaped income is at least Rs 50 lakh, and three years for an amount less than Rs 50 lakh.Previously, they could reassess cases up to 10 years old.According to an ET report, tax officials are now faced with the challenge of compiling and corroborating data on tax and income mismatches for the financial years 2013-14 to 2017-18 within the next few weeks, as these years will become time-barred for reassessment from September 1, 2024.The I-T department relies on information from various sources, such as banks, property registrars, and search findings from the investigation wing, to build reassessment cases.A tax officers' body has raised concerns about the feasibility of issuing notices under Section 148 (or 148A) in a large number of cases within a single month, given the overburdened nature of the jurisdictional assessing officers and the time-consuming process of obtaining sanction from the chief commissioner, who is the specified authority for such notices.Moreover, the law provides taxpayers with the right to explain their position before reassessment orders are finalized, a process that most believe cannot be completed by the end of August.Also Read | ITR refund status for FY 2023-24: How to check income tax refund status online - here’s a step-by-step guide for incometax.gov.in & NSDL websites The Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) has been urged by its officers to postpone the effective date of the proposed amendment. However, this suggestion is unlikely to be well-received by corporations and high net worth individuals.""Capping the reassessment period at five years was a great decision as it would reduce hassles and litigation. But if the department fears there could be a genuine loss of revenue as it may not be possible to wrap up several matters by August 31, the government can think of strict parameters where time-bound cases can be selectively reopened - based on trails of steps taken in identifying escaped income,"" said Mitil Chokshi, partner at CA firm Chokshi & Chokshi.""Taxpayers may expect a rush of reassessment notices in August 2024. These notices are likely to be for the AYs 2018-19 and prior to that. It is pertinent to note that the Bombay High Court in a recent ruling in a case of Hexaware Technologies has taken a view on a proviso introduced in 2021, which can be interpreted to mean that AY 2017-18 (and prior years) got time barred on March 31, 2024. These reassessment notices (for AYs 2017-18 and prior) are likely to rake up new interpretation issues in the already muddled reassessment provisions,"" said Ashish Mehta, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co.The current situation is similar to the conflict between the Income Tax office and taxpayers in 2021. The reassessment law was amended in April 2021, allowing the tax office to reopen 10-year-old tax returns if the total undisclosed income exceeded Rs 50 lakh and reassess 4-year-old matters if the amount was less than Rs 50 lakh.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? However, this change led to over 10,000 writ petitions being filed by companies, arguing that they were not given sufficient time to explain and that the notices were issued without considering the carve-out that cases which couldn't be reopened earlier couldn't be reassessed under the new law.The Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on May 4, 2022, to uphold all reassessment notices issued after March 31, 2021. However, the court left room for judicial proceedings based on the merits of each case, and several such matters are currently pending before the court.","The Income Tax Department is gearing up to send out a large number of notices in the coming month.

How NPS will increase tax savings

NPS and EPF: Overlapping services

What is NPS Vatsalaya?

Latest NPS rules, news: In the Union Budget 2024 speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced two new initiatives with regard to National Pension Scheme (NPS) - extension of NPS 14% employer contribution benefits to private setcor and the intended launch of NPS Vatsalya.Budget 2024 announced the hiking of the tax deduction limit on private sector employers’ contributions to NPS from 10% to 14% of employees’ basic salaries, bringing it at par with the provisions available for government employees.Sriram Iyer, CEO, HDFC Pension Management told ET that with this move the “ground rules have been harmonised among government and non-government employees, which is a positive step.”Effectively, this means that now, private-sector employees can choose to reduce the taxable portion of employers’ contribution to their NPS corpus, thereby paying less tax and leaving greater funds in their pension deposits.“Employees will benefit from tax savings . More importantly, the 40% increase in contribution will have a significant impact on the terminal value of the retirement corpus,” remarked Iyer. The extended savings will “help in retirement planning, working as an option that is at par with the Provident Fund,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder, 5nance.com was quoted as saying.Moreover, the endeavour aims to increase NPS penetration by increasing tax incentives for the private sector, providing them a social security-cushion post-retirement.The scheme’s motive to widen the NPS subscriber base may not prove to be flawlessly effective, however. This is explained by Agrees Mrin Agarwal, Founder, Finsafe India: “While it’s good that the limit has been raised, it may not increase adoption as employees need to be educated in a big way. Also, the benefit is only for the salaried opting for the new tax regime,” she says.The mandatory contribution to the EPF, too, threatens to relegate the provisions of NPS under the umbrella of near-superfluity. This sentiment is echoed by Varun Sahay, a software engineer in a Delhi-based IT company: “When 12% of my salary is already deducted for the EPF, why should I put in more in the NPS and cut my take-home pay?”Rohira feels otherwise. “There’s no competition between the NPS and EPF as employees can contribute to both and build a 3-4 times bigger corpus while earning 3-4% higher returns via marketlinked options in the NPS,” he counters.Also Check | New Tax Regime 2023 vs 2024 After Budget: How Much Income Tax Will Salaried Taxpayers Save & How Do New Tax Slabs Compare To Old Regime? Top 10 Points You Must Know To jumpstart retirement savings for children, a new initiative called NPS Vatsalya has been unveiled in the Budget. This scheme allows parents and guardians to contribute to a minor's account, which can be converted into a regular NPS account once the child reaches adulthood.""It provides a very long duration for reaping the compounding benefits and accumulating a huge bounty at a later age. This can be a good way to plan a better future for kids who may not opt for a service segment in the future,"" says Rohira. Sriram Iyer agrees, stating, ""It’s a good move to help the child start his retirement journey. Even if a parent starts when the child is 10 years old, by the time he starts working, it can be a solid foundation for the compounding journey after that.""However, some experts question the utility of a product with such a long lock-in period, especially when parents cannot use the funds for essential goals like their child’s education amidst soaring education costs of 11-12%.""Parents are struggling to save for their own retirement, so it might be a bit of a stretch to expect them to save for their kids’ retirement. The need of the hour is a market-linked product that allows withdrawals only for the child’s education,"" says Mrin Agarwal, Founder of Finsafe India.Also Read | Latest NPS rules 2024: How much tax will you save with new NPS contribution benefit under new regime after Budget 2024? Though the NPS permits partial withdrawals, it allows only 25% of the corpus after three years of joining, and this can be done only three times during the entire tenure. A premature exit before 60 years with 100% withdrawal is only possible if the corpus is less than Rs.2.5 lakh, an amount insufficient for most children's goals.""In its current form, there won’t be any uptake,"" asserts Agarwal. Rohira concurs, ""It’s a vanilla product with a lock-in, which does not make it very attractive and it may not take off. However, the government may optimise it and introduce new features later.""

Gold import duty cut: Why Indians may not find buying gold from Dubai as attractive post Budget 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-import-duty-cut-why-indians-may-not-find-buying-gold-from-dubai-as-attractive-post-budget-2024/articleshow/112097671.cms,"Gold import duty cut: Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group, estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India.

Gold import duty cut in Budget 2024: The recent reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers who frequently visit Dubai. Indian jewellers with stores in both India and the UAE believe that the narrowed duty differential will result in lower gold prices in India, making it less attractive for Indians to purchase gold in Dubai.The emirate had attracted gold-enthusiast Indians following a steep rise in customs duty in India in July 2022. In the fiscal 2024-25 budget, the duty on gold imports was more than halved.The duty cut is also expected to boost gold jewellery production in India, particularly the popular 'Kolkatti' jewellery from Kolkata, which is favored by Indian expats in Dubai and tourists from various countries. This move will encourage gold artisans to create new designs in both heavyweight and lightweight jewellery, attracting consumers to purchase gold from India.According to an ET report, Joy Alukkas, chairman of Joy Alukkas Group , estimates that nearly 50% of their UAE business will shift to India as Indian tourists who previously bought jewellery in Dubai will now prefer to shop in India. However, Indian expats living in Dubai and other customers may continue to buy from the UAE.Also Read | Gold losing sheen? Government cuts gold bond issuance target as investors look at better alternatives Rajiv Popley, director at Popley & Sons, believes that the perception of overseas gold being cheaper than in India is merely a mindset. He points out that the labour cost is significantly lower in India, and with the introduction of mandatory hallmarking and HUID numbers, the purity of gold in India is no longer a concern.Furthermore, NRIs in Dubai do not receive VAT refunds, and Indians travelling abroad only receive about 60% of the VAT back on their gold purchases. Gold trade analyst Bhargav Baidya suggests that the 1% duty differential between gold jewellery in India and Dubai will be offset by Indian jewellers offering discounts to retain and attract customers.Saurabh Gadgil, chairman of PNG Jewellers, notes that Indian import duty is now on par with the US, allowing Indian jewellers to offer competitive prices compared to other countries worldwide. The reduced customs duty is expected to make gold purchases in India more attractive and convenient for Indian consumers, potentially leading to a significant shift in their gold shopping preferences.","The reduction in customs duty on gold imports in the Union Budget 2024 is expected to significantly impact the gold shopping habits of Indian consumers.

Gold Bonds losing sheen

Gold losing sheen? The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal, according to a senior official. The revised target stands at Rs 18,500 crore, down from Rs 29,638 crore estimated in the interim budget and Rs 26,852 crore (revised estimate) in 2023-24.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ET ""The decision followed a reassessment of various factors, including investor demand, other investment products and uncertainties around the global economy, as the situation has changed since the interim budget in February.""After accounting for redemptions, the net issuances of sovereign gold bonds are now estimated at Rs 15,000 crore for this fiscal year, a significant decrease from the Rs 26,138 crore projected in the interim budget and Rs 25,352 crore in the revised estimate for 2023-24.Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India, attributed this shift to retail investors increasingly opting for equities in anticipation of better returns. He also noted that people are uncertain about the potential for further increases in gold prices in the short-to-medium term following a recent rally. Additionally, Galipelli pointed out that savings in rural areas have been impacted by retail inflation and other factors.The gold bond and gold monetisation schemes were introduced by the government in late 2015 to discourage the physical purchase of precious metals and reduce imports, thereby mitigating the negative impact on the current account deficit.The gross collection through these two schemes is now projected to be Rs 20,030 crore in 2024-25, compared to Rs 31,168 crore in the interim budget and Rs 28,240 crore (revised estimate) in the previous fiscal year. Similarly, the net collection is estimated at Rs 16,433 crore, down from Rs 27,571 crore in the interim budget and Rs 26,653 crore in the previous year. However, the estimates for the gold monetisation scheme remain unchanged from the interim budget level.Also Read | Budget 2024: Duty cuts on gold, silver, platinum, and diamonds to make jewellery more affordable The sovereign gold bond scheme targets investors who view gold as an investment, encouraging them to purchase paper gold instead of physical gold.On the other hand, the gold monetisation scheme aims to bring out idle gold held by households, temple trusts, and others to increase domestic supply. Both schemes were designed to curb gold imports, which, along with crude oil, have been significant contributors to India's current account deficit. Gold bond issuances had moderated after reaching Rs 16,049 crore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, before experiencing a surge in 2023-24.","The government has reduced its target for issuing gold bonds in the financial year 2024-25 by 38% compared to the previous interim budget goal.

In large solar projects (usually in solar parks) the 'pooling station' (transmission hub) comes to us (set up on site by park promoters or utilities). But we will have to wait for connectivity in case of 100-200 MW projects that could also face other issues such as land,"" group chairman Gurdeep Singh said after the Rs 10,000-crore IPO of subsidiary NTPC Green Energy opened on Wednesday.He said NTPC has developed capabilities in all areas of the renewables and enjoys certain advantages. ""It's not that we started yesterday. We have been in solar for a decade. We have the experience in commissioning, operating, commercial... You name it, we have it,"" he said.The company is following a clear road map for renewables that gleans lessons from the past and funding plans backed up the flagship's record. The focus on solar, however, does not come at the cost of other sustainable energy sources.""Solar is available 340-350 days across India, whereas wind is periodic - except one or two locations. So someone with wind (project) in the south and solar in Rajasthan can do mix-and-match (with smaller projects). We will certainly go into wind or add battery storage wherever we find attractive. We are also pursuing nuclear and green hydrogen separately,"" he said.NTPC aims to ramp up renewable capacity to 19 GW by 2027 after nearly doubling the present capacity of 3.5 GW to 6 GW by 2025 on way to the 60-GW mark. Singh said NTPC is well-equipped to weathering possible market shifts due to tighter import policy for solar cells or external factor such as an expected dilution in the US focus on renewables under Donald Trump's second presidency.""The impact of duty on solar cell imports, if it comes, will be minimal on projects. As for shift in US policy, I am told some made in India solar modules are exported. We will have to see (how things pan out). There is Europe, other regions..."" he said.On IPO pricing being ""punchy"" amid the market slide following Trump's election, Singh said it's based on misplaced notion.

Ford has 28,000 employees in Europe, and 174,000 worldwide.""The global auto industry continues to be in a period of significant disruption as it shifts to electrified mobility,"" the company said in a statement. ""The transformation is particularly intense in Europe where automakers face significant competitive and economic headwinds while also tackling a misalignment between CO2 regulations and consumer demand for electrified vehicles,"" the statement said.In Europe, automakers must sell enough electric vehicles to meet new, lower limits for fleet average carbon dioxide emissions in 2025, and face a longer term 2035 EU goal of reducing emissions to zero, which would mean the elimination of most vehicles with internal combustion engines.EV sales however have lagged as consumers weary of inflation have held back on spending and after major car market Germany dropped government purchase incentives for EVs. Electric vehicles sales fell by 5.8% in the first nine months of the year in an overall shrinking market for cars. Carmakers are also facing increasing competition from Chinese-made electric vehicles.The company said that it would also reduce working time for workers at its Cologne, Germany plant where it makes the Capri and Explorer electric vehicles.Ford sales fell 15.3% in the first nine months of the year compared to the same period last year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. The company's market share shrank to 3% from 3.5% The Dearborn, Michigan, headquartered automaker saw company-wide net profit fall by 26% to $892 million in the third quarter as it took $1 billion in accounting charges to write down assets for a canceled three-row electric SUV. The company cited higher warranty and other costs.Ford is an established brand in Europe and will mark its 100th anniversary of doing business in Germany next year. Its main plant in Cologne started production in 1931; the groundbreaking was attended by Henry Ford and then-Mayor Konrad Adenauer, later Germany's chancellor.Ford is not alone in suffering from headwinds. Volkswagen has said it is contemplating closing as many as three of its German plants, according to its chief employee representative. European Automobile Manufacturers' Association has called for a speedier review of lower C02 limits slated for 2026.Ford said company vice chairman and CFO John Lawler had written a letter to the German government reiterating Ford's commitment to climate goals but urging action to improve market conditions and ensuring the industry's future success.""What we lack in Europe and Germany is an unmistakable, clear policy agenda to advance e-mobility, such as public investments in charging infrastructure, meaningful incentives to help consumers make the shift to electrified vehicles, improving cost competitiveness for manufacturers, and greater flexibility in meeting CO2 compliance targets,"" Lawler said.","Ford Motor Co. says it will reduce its workforce by 4,000 in Europe and the U.K. by the end of 2027.

High public debt can’t be left to fester in the US and its peers in a world that is prone to more pandemics than before, former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan said.Speaking to reporters in Rome, the one-time chief economist of the International Monetary Fund warned that countries that keep swelling existing mountains of borrowings leave themselves exposed for when the next emergency hits them.“We had the global financial crisis and the pandemic,” he said on Tuesday. “People say pandemics are going to be more regular over the next century, so we can’t be satisfied with building up debt.”Rajan said his warning is apt for the US, whose debt trajectory will keep increasing steadily, according to IMF forecasts released last month. Donald Trump is currently weighing whom to appoint to manage that pile of borrowings for when he takes over the White House next year.“I don’t think we should be satisfied with this level of debt, it should be a vulnerability,” said Rajan, who is a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. “This certainly is a message for the United States.”Global public debt is set to reach $100 trillion, or 93% of global gross domestic product, by the end of this year, driven by the US and China, according to the IMF.While slowing inflation and falling interest rates offer governments a window to get their fiscal houses in order, the fund observed that there isn’t enough urgency to do so.Rajan said debt must be reduced to give countries a buffer for times of need, and that such dangers should not be underestimated. He added that high debt levels also make it difficult for countries to aid one another, which is a further vulnerability for the world.He spoke on the sidelines of the annual Bancor prize award in Rome, where he gave a speech on the need to protect the future against a fragmenting world. Among solutions Rajan proposes reforming multilateral institutions, opening new areas of trade like services trade and climate action among the willing.","Raghuram Rajan says high public debt can’t be left to fester in the US and its peers in a world that is prone to more pandemics than before.

SINGAPORE: Bitcoin rose to a record high above $94,000 as a report that Donald Trump's social media company was in talks to buy crypto trading firm Bakkt added to hopes of a cryptocurrency-friendly regime under the incoming Trump administration.Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency , has more than doubled this year. It was last at $92,104 in Asian hours on Wednesday, having touched a record high $94,078 just toward the end of the previous session.The Financial Times, citing two people with knowledge, said Trump Media and Technology Group , which operates Truth Social, is close to an all-stock acquisition of Bakkt, which is backed by NYSE-owner Intercontinental Exchange.Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, said bitcoin's rise to a record high was supported by the Trump deal talk report as well as traders taking advantage of the first day of options trading on the Nasdaq over BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF.Cryptocurrencies have soared since the November 5 US election as traders bet President-elect Trump's promised support for digital assets would lead to a less restrictive regulatory regime and inject some life back into bitcoin after a listless few months.The growing excitement has taken the global cryptocurrency market's value above $3 trillion to a record high, based on analytics and data aggregator CoinGecko.Chris Weston, head of research at Australian online broker Pepperstone, said there is real underlying buying pressure for bitcoin, and ""another kick higher should bring in a fresh chase from those who like to buy what's strong"".","Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has more than doubled this year.

The IMF team on Sunday arrived in Sri Lanka to carry out the third review of the nearly USD 3 billion bailout facility.The third review should lead to the fourth tranche of the 4-year facility. It would be around 330 million dollars as was the case in the previous three tranches, Finance Ministry officials said.Sri Lanka's economic reform programme is supported by the IMF's Extended Fund Facility (EFF).Dissanayake met the IMF's Sri Lanka mission chief Peter Breuer and the delegation.He urged the IMF team to consider the economic hardships faced by the people and strike a balance in the economic recovery programme, the release added.In his presidential election campaign, President Dissanayake vowed to renegotiate the IMF to water down hard conditions laid down for the recovery.Dissanayake's National People's Power (NPP) was highly critical of the cost recovery-based utility tariffs and high taxes which came conditional to the bailout.The IMF team had earlier met the former president Ranil Wickremesinghe who had successfully steered the IMF programme for economic recovery as a result Sri Lanka was described as one of the quickest to recover from a crippling economic crisis.Sri Lanka plunged into an economic crisis when the island nation declared sovereign default in mid-April of 2022, its first since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. Almost civil-war-like conditions and months of public protests led to the fleeing of the then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa.""The IMF delegation praised our two-year efforts to achieve recovery they warned that deviation from it can mean hardships again for the local economy,"" Shehan Semasinghe one of the junior ministers under the Wickremesinghe administration, who was responsible for the IMF negotiations, said.Wickremesinghe's IMF-dictated reforms became unpopular and he finished third behind Dissanayake in the September presidential election.Dissanayake's NPP recorded a resounding victory at last week's parliamentary election winning absolute control of the House.",The IMF team on Sunday arrived in Sri Lanka to carry out the third review of the nearly USD 3 billion bailout facility.

Stocks fell and global bonds climbed on worries over the latest escalation in Russia’s war against Ukraine.S&P 500 futures dipped 0.4%, paring earlier losses as Walmart Inc. rallied about 4% in premarket trading after boosting its outlook. The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell six basis points to 4.36%. The moves were steeper in Europe, with German bond yields dropping to the lowest since October and the stocks benchmark losing 1%. Poland’s main stock index sank more than 3%.Markets were rattled by reports that Ukrainian forces reportedly carried out their first strike on a border region in Russia using Western-supplied missiles. Earlier, President Vladimir Putin had approved an updated nuclear doctrine that expanded the conditions for Russia to use atomic weapons, including in response to a massive conventional attack on its soil. Putin had pledged in September to revise the doctrine.“For the moment the market reaction is contained,” said Andrea Tueni, head of sales trading at Saxo Banque France. “Some are still in a wait-and see-mode.”Traditional haven assets including the Japanese yen, Swiss franc and gold gained. Ukraine’s sovereign dollar bonds fell the most among emerging-market peers.In commodities, natural-gas futures advanced as much as 1.1%, trading near their highest levels in a year. Gold was up 0.7% at $2,630 an ounce. Oil traders, meanwhile, appeared unfazed, with prices falling after Europe’s largest oil field gradually restarted following a power outage.The sudden repricing underscored how vulnerable markets remain to any flare-up in the conflict. It cut short a long losing streak for Treasuries, which had broadly sold off since mid-September on expectations Donald Trump’s policies will boost growth and rekindle inflation.Trump’s pending nomination of a Treasury secretary and the impact that will have on policy was also front and center on Tuesday. The transition team is considering pairing Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve official, in the Treasury secretary role, with hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as director of the White House’s National Economic Council, according to people familiar with the matter.“Kevin Warsh was in the FOMC, so the likelihood of political interference into the Fed policy making is certainly diminishing if he were to become the Treasury secretary,” said Gero Jung, chief economist of Mirabaud Asset Management in Geneva.Meanwhile, Bitcoin is back in the vicinity of an all-time high, climbing above $92,000. The digital asset has been supported by a series of developments highlighting the deepening embrace of the digital-asset industry by Trump.Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. is in talks to buy digital-asset marketplace Bakkt Holdings Inc.

Google appeal

AI overviews

Top Justice Department antitrust officials have decided to ask a judge to force Alphabet Inc.’s Google to sell off its Chrome browser in what would be a historic crackdown on one of the world’s biggest tech companies.The department will ask the judge, who ruled in August that Google illegally monopolized the search market, to require measures related to artificial intelligence and its Android smartphone operating system, according to people familiar with the plans.Antitrust officials, along with states that have joined the case, also plan to recommend Wednesday that federal judge Amit Mehta impose data licensing requirements, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.If Mehta accepts the proposals, they have the potential to reshape the online search market and the burgeoning AI industry. The case was filed under the first Trump administration and continued under President Joe Biden . It marks the most aggressive effort to rein in a technology company since Washington unsuccessfully sought to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago.Owning the world’s most popular web browser is key for Google’s ads business. The company is able to see activity from signed-in users, and use that data to more effectively target promotions, which generate the bulk of its revenue. Google has also been using Chrome to direct users to its flagship AI product, Gemini, which has the potential to evolve from an answer-bot to an assistant that follows users around the web.Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, said the Justice Department “continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case.” She added, “the government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.”The Justice Department declined to comment.Google shares fell as much as 1.8% to $172.16 in late trading. They had been up 25% this year through the close.Antitrust enforcers want the judge to order Google to sell off Chrome — the most widely used browser worldwide — because it represents a key access point through which many people use its search engine, the people said.The government has the option to decide whether a Chrome sale is necessary at a later date if some of the other aspects of the remedy create a more competitive market, the people added. The Chrome browser controls about 61% of the market in the US, according to StatCounter , a web traffic analytics service.Government attorneys met with dozens of companies over the past three months as they prepared the recommendation.

MCX Gold is currently consolidating near its all-time high of 140,465. With prices rebounding from the lower end of the range, the current level within the consolidation is seen as a buying opportunity. A breakout above the recent highs is likely to reignite the bullish momentum. As long as prices stay above the breakout zone, the overall outlook for Gold continues to be bullish.From a technical stance, the 134,000 zone stands out as a strong support, representing the breakout above the prior swing high. Any pullback toward this level is likely to encourage fresh buying interest, helping to limit near-term downside. Sustaining above this support reinforces the bullish structure and keeps the positive momentum firmly in place.Gold is well positioned to move toward the 144,000 level in the coming sessions.This potential advance aligns with the broader bullish trend and highlights the strength of the prevailing market momentum. Moreover, a clear and sustained breakout above the intermediate resistance of the consolidation range could draw in additional buying interest, further strengthening positive sentiment and paving the way for an extended upward move.Overall, Gold is firmly positioned to sustain its positive bias, with the broader technical structure strongly supporting trend continuation. As long as prices hold above the critical 134,000 support, the bullish setup remains intact. With momentum indicators and overall market sentiment continuing to stay supportive, the precious metal appears well poised for further upside in the coming sessions.MCX Silver has marked a fresh all-time high this week, with prices consistently forming higher highs over the past several months. Despite the recent pullback, the overall bias remains positive, and any declines toward the lower end of the weekly range are likely to present buying opportunities. We recommend trading in line with the existing trend, which remains firmly bullish.Silver’s rebound from the support level highlights renewed strength in the trend and increases the likelihood of further upside. As long as prices remain above the weekly support levels, the bullish bias is expected to stay intact. The immediate key support is placed near the 231,000 level, which now serves as a strong base. Any pullback toward this area is likely to attract fresh buying interest, helping to stabilize prices and sustain the upward momentum.On the upside, Silver is strongly positioned to challenge the 275,000 resistance over the near to medium term. This anticipated move marks a continuation of the prior bullish phase and is firmly supported by robust market momentum and favourable technical indicators. Overall, as long as prices remain comfortably above the 231,000 support, Silver is expected to sustain its positive trajectory, with ample scope for further upside as bullish sentiment continues to build.","Gold and silver prices are touching new record highs and this is a phase of consolidation, says Abhilash Koikkara, Head - Forex & Commodities, Nuvama Professional Clients Group.

Domestic equity benchmarks witnessed a sharp correction over the last four sessions, giving up the entirety of last week’s gains as relentless FII outflows continued. The sell-off was fueled by escalating global uncertainties, particularly speculation over possible US military action in Venezuela and evolving developments related to Greenland. Market sentiment weakened further following comments by the US President on India’s procurement of Russian oil, which raised apprehensions about potential tariff actions against India. These combined global and trade-related concerns led to heightened risk aversion across markets.The index on Thursday's session formed a sizable bearish candle with a lower high and a lower low, indicating an extension of the corrective decline for the fourth consecutive session. In the process, it also slipped below the rising trendline connecting recent swing lows and the 50-day EMA for the first time since 3 October 2025, highlighting a deterioration in short-term price structure.Looking ahead, sustained follow-through weakness could open further downside towards the 25,700–25,600 region.This zone represents a confluence of the previous month’s low and the 100-day EMA, making it an important medium-term support area.On the shorter-term horizon, momentum indicators suggest the market is in an oversold territory. Therefore, a technical pullback cannot be ruled out. However, for the corrective decline to pause, the index must close above the previous session’s high and decisively reclaim the 26,100 level. While key resistance remains at the 26,300 levels being the almost identical highs of the last two months.Bank Nifty continues to outperform the Nifty, displaying clear relative strength during the current week it has rallied to a fresh all-time high of 60437.Going forward, the index is expected to remain in a consolidation phase within the 59,500–60,400 range. A decisive breakout above this range or a breakdown below it will provide clarity on the next directional move.On the downside, immediate support is seen at 59,500, while the key short-term support zone lies at 59,000–58,700. This area is significant as it represents a confluence of the 50-day EMA and the previous month’s low, making it a crucial level to watch.The stock has generated a breakout above a falling trendline joining highs of the last 2 months signaling resumption of up move and offers fresh entry opportunity.On the downside key support is placed at 2300-2250 levels being the presence of recent trendline support and key retracement of the recent up move.We expect the stock to head towards 2520 levels being the 61.8% retracement of the previous major decline (2667-2245).Tata Power continues to trade sideways on the daily timeframe, oscillating within a well-defined range of ₹370–₹410. The stock is currently forming a rectangle pattern, with consistent buying support emerging near the ₹370 zone.We expect the stock to rebound taking support at the lower band of the range of 370 and head higher towards the upper band of the range placed around 410 levels.On the lower side key support is placed at 355-350 levels being the key retracement of the recent up move.","Bajaj Broking Research's top stock picks for January 9, 2026 are Hindustan Unilever and Tata Power.

New Labour Codes explained: After rolling out our new labour codes in last November 2025, the government has now published the draft rules, inviting public feedback within stipulated timelines up to February 14, 2026, and January 30, 2026 for the Industrial Relations Rules.These draft rules are important because they outline several key provisions that cover wage definitions for gratuity, overtime payout criteria, rest days, contract labour conditions, grievance redressal mechanisms, compliance obligations for firms, need for appointment letters, employee benefits, standing orders across sectors and the creation of a worker re-skilling fund.According to EY, in response to the rules, organizations should do a comprehensive review across HR, finance, payroll and legal functions, supported by impact assessments and policy revisions, to align with the new labour law framework.The biggest clarification that comes from the release of the draft rules is on the definition of wages. The calculation of wages is important since this is what decides the gratuity amount received by individuals when leaving their jobs.According to the draft rules, wages cover:If the allowances and benefits together (except gratuity and retrenchment compensation) exceed 50% of the all remuneration, the excess amount shall be added back to wages.This added amount shall be treated as wages for statutory purposes. Leave encashment is not a part of allowances.As per the Code on Social Security, 2020, gratuity has to be calculated based on the rate of “wages” last drawn by the employee.The rules clarify that for the purpose of determination of gratuity, the exclusions from ‘wages’ shall also include any payment payable on an annual basis, that is linked to performance or productivity of an employee or of the establishment in which he/she is employed and is not part of the remuneration payable under the terms of employment.Additionally, the following shall not form part of the ‘wages’ –However, according to an EY analysis, the rules are yet to clarify if such components will be covered within the 50% limit on exclusions in the definition of ‘wages’.Gratuity shall be payable in following events:The calculation is simple: for every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months: 15 days’ wages per year (or such number as notified by Central Government) based on the rate of wages last drawn. The maximum gratuity is as notified by the central government which is currently Rs 20 lakh.Employees will be entitled to at least one ‘rest day’ per week. The employee shall not be required or allowed to work on the rest day unless they have a substituted rest day for a whole day on one of the working days in a week immediately before or after the rest day.No substitution can be made which will result in the employee working for more than ten days consecutively without a rest day for a whole day, the new rules say.A letter of appointment has to be issued to all employees in an establishment within 3 months of the new labour rules coming into force.Workers will be entitled to overtime pay, if certain work hour criteria are met. As per the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Rules, if a worker works for more than 8 hours in any day as daily wager in an organisation, or for more than 48 hours in any week, they shall be entitled to wages at the rate of twice his rate of wages for the extra time and shall be paid at the end of each wage period.Accordingly, ‘workers’ shall be entitled to overtime for working beyond 48 hours in a week (without any daily working hour limit for applicability of overtime).There are rules for employment of women in night shifts (i.e., after 7 PM and before 6 AM) – written consent of women employees is required and a pick and drop transport facility is mandatory.Every employer of a factory, dock, mine, building & other construction work has to ensure free of cost medical examination for every employee annually. This has to happen within 120 days from the commencement of the calendar year for those who have completed 40 years of age. An employer may avail facility for medical examination of the employee (s) under relevant rule of Social Security Code Rules, 2025 through Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC).The employer and negotiating union/council or majority of employees of the establishment (in the absence of negotiating union/ council) can enter into agreements for provision of creche facility in the establishment and if not provided, then for pay creche allowance, which shall not be less than Rs 500 per month per child.The employer has to pay a journey allowance to inter-state migrant workers once in 12 months for a to & fro journey from the place of employment to the place of residence.Any employer who retrenches a worker(s) has to transfer an amount equivalent to 15 days last drawn wages of such worker(s), within 10 days of such retrenchment, in an account to be maintained by the prescribed labour commissioner.The fund received from the employer can be electronically transferred by the labour commissioner to the account of the retrenched worker(s) within 45 days of retrenchment to enable the worker(s) to utilize the amount for re-skilling.Employment of contract labour in core activities of an establishment is not allowed, subject to exceptions. As per the OSHWC Rules, the Joint Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Labour & Employment (‘MoLE’) is empowered to pass an order on the question whether an activity classifies as a core activity or not.Other conditions with respect to engagement of contract labour include:Every industrial establishment that employs 20 or more workers has to set up a grievance redressal committee that will look to resolve disputes that arise out of individual grievances.The OSHWC Rules introduce a provision for setting up a separate grievance redressal mechanism for contract labour for redressal of grievances related to health, working conditions and wages. The grievances may be submitted at the level of the principal employer.In addition, every establishment employing 500 or more workers has to constitute a safety committee in the prescribed manner and shall consist of an equal number of members representing the employer and the workers, which shall not exceed 20.According to an EY analysis, while the rules pre-published by the government under labour codes have introduced some significant changes to promote ease of doing business and simplify compliance, it is essential for organizations to thoroughly assess the implications of these changes. It recommends the following points for organisations to take note of:","All remuneration whether by way of salaries, allowances or otherwise payable to a person employed. If the payments/allowances other than Basic pay, Dearness allowance and Retaining allowance exceed 50% then amount exceeding 50% will be added in the ‘Wages’ category.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126412786,imgsize-64302,width-400,resizemode-4/new-labour-codes.jpg"

Taxing the employee’s own PF savings

The bigger picture: When rules punish good behaviour

Tax on employer contributions beyond ₹7.5 lakh

Tax on the growth of such contributions

Tax on interest from their own PF contributions beyond ₹2.5 lakh

Tax on NPS pension at retirement

Tax again if early withdrawal triggers PF conditions

Why reform is required

For a country that prides itself on a thriving middle class, India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality. Over the past few years, a series of amendments—presented as “rationalisations”—have quietly created a minefield for salaried employees who believed they were doing the right thing by saving for their future.Three provisions stand out for the burden they impose: taxation of employer contributions to provident and superannuation funds beyond ₹7.5 lakh; yearly taxation of accretions on such excess contributions; and taxation of interest earned on the employee’s own PF contributions above ₹2.5 lakh. In isolation each may appear technical. Together, they are reshaping retirement planning in ways that leave employees with little clarity, greater financial anxiety, and a rising tax bill on income they do not even receive today.The first shock for employees came with the Finance Act, 2020, which capped employer contributions to recognised PF, approved superannuation funds and NPS at ₹7.5 lakh per year. Anything above that—common for senior professionals, mid-level employees in high-cost cities, and those in organisations with generous retirement policies—became taxable as a perquisite.But what stings more is that annual accretion—interest, dividend or similar growth—on this “excess contribution” is also taxed. This is a tax on notional income, long before the employee sees a rupee of it.Many describe this as an upfront penalty on saving. Unlike bonuses or cash payments, retirement contributions are locked in for the long term. Yet tax is now collected today on money that may only be received decades later. That mismatch betweenandhas become a major pain point.When exemption isn’t really exemptionThe hardship intensifies when the National Pension System comes into play. While the government justified taxing excess employer contributions by calling PF, superannuation and NPS an “EEE regime”, the law doesn’t fully support that claim.Under Section 10(12A), up to 60% of the NPS corpus can be withdrawn tax-free upon closure of the account or opting out of NPS. The remaining 40% must be used to purchase an annuity plan from a life insurance company, and the pension received from this annuity is fully taxable. Employees therefore argue that the premise of an entirely exempt regime is not accurate.The Finance Act, 2021 introduced another hit: PF interest earned on the employee’s own contribution beyond ₹2.5 lakh per year is taxable.For many mid-career employees, PF is the only disciplined savings instrument they rely on. A high PF contribution isn’t a luxury; it is a way to secure the future in the absence of universal social security.Yet the law now characterises high contributions—even when mandatory or part of salary structure—as an attempt to “enjoy full exemption”. The sting is sharper for those whose basic salary is high enough that the statutory 12% PF contribution itself may cross the ₹2.5 lakh threshold, triggering tax on interest even when the employee never intended to “over-contribute”. This change is seen as especially harsh in a country where inflation erodes purchasing power and pension adequacy is already a concern.“Also, these changes all appear to be part of the ultimate aim of the government to do away with all deductions and exemptions and make the ‘new tax regime’ the only regime available for all taxpayers,” says Ameet Patel, partner, Manohar Chowdhry & Associates.Across these provisions, a consistent theme emerges:India now taxes retirement savings more aggressively. Employees who save diligently, especially mid- to senior-level workers, face:The result is that long-term savings face multiple tax points.There is growing consensus across industry bodies that these provisions need urgent review. The argument is not about giving employees a windfall—it is about ensuring fairness and a safety net. With an ageing population, lack of a universal social security system applicable to all citizens, and rising cost of living, the existing provisions are detrimental . India’s salaried class feels squeezed—not because they don’t want to pay taxes, but because the system increasingly treats retirement savings as a luxury rather than a necessity. What was once a predictable, trusted savings pathway is now layered with caps, tax triggers, and compliance complications.“And this compounds the problems that the ageing population faces when insurance companies either refuse to issue new health policies to senior citizens or charge such high premia on the policies that having a Mediclaim policy becomes extremely expensive for such retired persons. As and when such a person needs large amounts to be paid to hospitals for medical treatments, the depleted savings are often inadequate and the entire family is put under huge financial stress,” concludes Patel.","India’s tax treatment of retirement savings has begun to feel oddly out of step with economic reality. A high PF contribution isn’t a luxury; it is a way to secure the future in the absence of universal social security. Unlike bonuses or cash payments, retirement contributions are locked in for the long term.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126356780,imgsize-44462,width-400,resizemode-4/budget-2026.jpg"

BENGALURU: Discussions between edtech firms Unacademy and UpGrad for a potential acquisition fell through after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on valuation, people familiar with the matter said. UpGrad had been in early stage buyout talks with Unacademy, but the discussions collapsed.Confirming the development to TOI, Ronnie Screwvala , founder of UpGrad, said the talks were at a preliminary stage and were called off after valuation expectations did not align.

MUMBAI: Indian bank stocks outperformed the broader market in the Oct-Dec quarter, with valuations rising sharply after GST cuts ahead of the festive season lifted consumption and strengthened expectations of a pickup in credit growth.Data from S&P Global Market Intelligence show the combined market capitalisation of the top 20 listed banks rose to about Rs 55.7 lakh crore at end-Dec from an estimated Rs 51.5 lakh crore at end-Sept, implying a quarter-on-quarter increase of around 8.2%. This gain exceeded the roughly 4% rise in sensex over the same period, reflecting the banking sector's re-rating driven by improving demand and lending prospects.Seventeen of the top 20 banks posted increases in market capitalisation, with the median gain at about 11.8%. Smaller private-sector lenders emerged as clear outperformers. IDFC First Bank recorded the sharpest rise, with market capitalisation jumping 43.8%, lifting it to 13th place from 17th in the previous quarter. Bank of India followed with a 38.6% increase, while AU Small Finance Bank, which received RBI's nod to become a universal bank, gained 36.1%.Canara Bank also stood out among larger lenders, with a 25.2% rise, well above the sector average.Gains among the biggest banks were steadier but supported the overall increase in valuations. HDFC Bank, the country's most valuable lender, saw its market capitalisation rise 4.4% to about Rs 15.2 lakh crore. State Bank of India added 12.6%, broadly in line with the sector median, while Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank rose 12.1% and 10.4%, respectively. ICICI Bank was an outlier among the top five, slipping 0.3% in the quarter but retaining its second rank by market value.Public-sector banks, taken together, delivered mostly double-digit gains, led by Bank of Baroda at 14.5%, Union Bank of India at 11% and Indian Bank at 11.5%. However, performance diverged within the group. Indian Overseas Bank and UCO Bank were the weakest outliers, with market capitalisation declines of 8.6% and 3.4%, respectively.The valuation gains coincided with a supportive macro and policy backdrop. RBI cut the policy repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 6.25% in Dec 2025, part of a cumulative 125-bps reduction since Feb 2025, to support lending amid low inflation (1 bps = 0.01%).The Nifty Bank index rose about 7.6% during the quarter, also outperforming the broader market.""Overall systemic credit growth is showing signs of improvement,"" Emkay Global said in a Jan 3 note.",Indian bank stocks outperformed the broader market in the Oct-Dec quarter. Valuations rose sharply after GST cuts ahead of the festive season lifted consumption and strengthened expectations of a pickup in credit growth.

U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH

HYDERABAD: Though every country has the right to decide who it wants to shut its doors to and who to let in, US President Donald Trump's move to clamp down on immigration, and curb the flow of talent from India in particular, was nothing but ""foolish"", The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) co-founder Kanwal Rekhi told TOI.""The feeling in America right now is that we need to reserve jobs and spots at universities.

Cigarette tax hike: Experts warn of surge in illicit trade; fear major revenue losses for government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cigarette-tax-hike-experts-warn-of-surge-in-illicit-trade-fear-major-revenue-losses-for-government/articleshow/126334324.cms,"Representative image

A sharp increase in taxes on cigarettes, along with a new excise duty structure on tobacco products, could trigger a surge in illicit trade and lead to significant revenue losses for the government, experts have warned.Earlier this week, the finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks, depending on their length.The new excise duty, which comes into effect from February 1, will be levied in addition to the existing 40 per cent Goods and Services Tax ( GST ).This change implies an overall tax hike of around 60–70 per cent, varying by cigarette length, compared with the current overall tax incidence of about 50–55 per cent.The move marks a transition from the GST compensation cess to an excise-based regime for demerit goods.The unexpected nature of the tax increase has raised concerns about higher smuggling and illegal trade in tobacco products.According to news agency PTI, Ranganath Tannir, secretary general of Think Change Forum, said the steep rise could prove counterproductive. “Public finance theory is clear that excessive taxation of inelastic goods fuels illicit trade, not compliance,” he said, adding that cigarettes in India are already among the least affordable globally based on World Health Organization affordability indicators.Making them more expensive is unlikely to curb demand, but could push consumers towards illegal and smuggled products, undermining tax collections, he noted.Brokerage reports have echoed similar concerns. According to JPMorgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research, a higher tax rate for the King Size Filter Tip (KSFT) segment increases the risk of consumers downtrading to cheaper options and may also lead to higher consumption of illicit cigarettes.Illicit tobacco already accounts for about 26 per cent of India’s total tobacco market, making the country the fourth-largest market globally for smuggled tobacco, PTI reported.Nomura, in its research note, said that while higher taxes are aimed at reducing consumption, they often have unintended consequences. “High taxes on cigarettes… fuel the growth of illicit cigarettes and push consumers towards cheaper, non-tax paid smuggled cigarettes,” the brokerage said.Jefferies, citing a report by the Tobacco Institute of India (TII), said the industry body has urged the government to review the proposed excise structure.A wider gap between legal and illegal prices could benefit non-duty-paid cigarettes and result in higher tax leakage, the report noted.Experts also pointed to international experience to underline the risks. Australia’s repeated tobacco tax hikes between 2012 and 2020 led to a sharp rise in cigarette prices and were followed by a jump in illicit tobacco consumption from under 2 per cent to around 14 per cent of the market.Calling the proposed excise levies “unprecedented”, an analyst said there is still time to reassess the decision before it comes into force.“Since they take effect from February 1, 2026, the government has an opportunity to revisit and rectify them before they spawn a much larger problem of uncontrollable illicit networks,” the analyst warned, as per PTI.","The finance ministry notified amendments to the Central Excise Act, introducing a fresh excise duty ranging from Rs 2,050 to Rs 8,500 per 1,000 cigarette sticks.

The 10-year Treasury yield is a benchmark for mortgage rates, so the forecast suggests mortgage borrowing could get more expensive over the next two years.The CBO on Thursday released new economic projections for the next three years, taking into account Trump's tariffs, immigration policies and last year's federal government shutdown, among other factors.""Together, those adjustments affected the near-term path of GDP, employment, and inflation but did not materially change the overall economic outlook through 2028,"" the report states.Jobless rates are expected to increase before they improve over the next two years, the report states.The CBO expects the unemployment rate to peak at 4.6% in 2026 but then ease to 4.4% in 2028 - affected largely by the impacts of Trump's tax and spending law, passed by Congress and signed in July, as well as fewer migrants in the country.Also, the budget office projects that real gross domestic product growth is expected to rise to 2.2% in 2026, supported by the tax and spending law and a rebound from the late-2025 shutdown. GDP growth is then set to slow to an average of 1.8% in 2027 and 2028 as fiscal support wanes and labor force growth slows. The forecasts are similar to those made by the Federal Reserve, though the Fed expects growth will reach 2% in 2027 and 1.9% in 2028.Last September, when the CBO released an updated three-year outlook, it issued the same projection for GDP growth for the next three years.Inflation is expected remain above the Fed's 2% target in the near term, the CBO says, due to tariffs and stronger demand, gradually falling to 2.1% in 2028.On Wednesday, the CBO released data that predicts the U.S. population is projected to grow by 15 million people in 30 years, a smaller estimate than in previous years, due to Trump's hardline immigration policies and an expected lower fertility rate.Lawmakers established the Congressional Budget Office more than 50 years ago to provide objective, impartial analysis to support the budget process.","The Congressional Budget Office released new economic projections for the next three years, taking into account Trump's tariffs, immigration policies and last year's federal government shutdown.

500% Tariff Shock? Trump Okays 'Graham-Blumenthal Bill', Clashes With China Amid Tensions

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's approval to a new bill that allows for up to 500% tariff on countries importing Russian petroleum is a threat not just for China and India, but even others, such as the European Union, which have opposed Moscow's offensive against Ukraine but have been buying energy.An analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) has estimated that since the Ukraine conflict began in Feb 2022, Russia earned 1,002 billion euros (around $1.2 trillion at current exchange rate) from fossil fuel exports, with oil's share being 68% and the rest being gas (over 20%) and coal (over 10%).While China was the largest importer of Russian oil, with purchases exceeding 210 billion euros (around $245 billion) until Monday, India was second - spending $168 billion, followed by EU $125 billion (see graph).China's cumulative spend on Russian fossil fuels was estimated at nearly 294 billion euros ($343 billion), while India spent over 162 billion euros ($190 billion) on oil and coal. According to CREA's monthly analysis of Russian fossil fuel exports and sanctions, China's crude oil imports fell to 3.1 billion euros in Nov from 3.7 billion euros in Oct, while India's imports rose marginally to 2.6 billion euros in Nov from 2.5 billion euros in Oct.Now, all eyes are on what Trump does next. Many see the US action as fresh pressure to get Russia on the negotiating table and agree to the terms being pushed by him.Energy policy and geopolitics expert Narendra Taneja said the new US bill has only been passed by the US Congress and does not necessarily mean it will be implemented by the administration. ""We should wait and watch,"" Taneja said.So far, India has focused on its commercial interests while making purchases, including from Russia whose share in the Indian oil basket has reduced but it remains the biggest source for crude. With Lukoil and Rosneft facing sanctions, Indian purchases from Russia are expected to moderate.","China was the largest importer of Russian oil, with purchases exceeding 210 billion euros (around $245 billion) until Monday.

Global AI race: DeepSeek gains ground in developing nations; Microsoft flags widening gap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/global-ai-race-deepseek-gains-ground-in-developing-nations-microsoft-flags-widening-gap/articleshow/126419279.cms,"Photo credit- AP

Chinese AI startup DeepSeek is seeing rapid adoption across several developing countries, helping broaden access to generative artificial intelligence even as the overall gap between advanced and emerging economies continues to widen, according to a new Microsoft report.The report said global adoption of generative AI tools reached 16.3% of the world’s population in the three months to December, up from 15.1% in the preceding quarter, AP reported. However, AI adoption in developed economies — described by Microsoft as the “global north” — is growing at nearly twice the pace of adoption in developing countries.“We are seeing a divide and we are concerned that that divide will continue to widen,” Juan Lavista Ferres, chief data scientist at Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab, said. The analysis is based on anonymised telemetry data tracking global device usage.Countries that invested early in digital infrastructure and artificial intelligence continue to lead adoption levels, including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, France and Spain. The findings broadly align with earlier surveys, including research by the Pew Research Center, which showed higher enthusiasm for AI in countries such as South Korea.Against this backdrop, the rise of DeepSeek — founded in 2023 — has played a significant role in expanding AI use across parts of the developing world. Microsoft researchers said DeepSeek’s free-to-use and “open source” models have lowered barriers to adoption, particularly in price-sensitive regions.When DeepSeek released its advanced reasoning model R1 in January 2025, claiming it was more cost-effective than comparable offerings from OpenAI, it drew attention across the global technology industry. Research co-authored by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng and published in Nature later that year described the work as a “landmark paper”.Lavista Ferres said DeepSeek performs well on tasks such as mathematics and coding, but noted that it operates differently from US-based models on politically sensitive topics. “For certain type of questions, of course, they follow the same type of access to the internet that China has,” he said, adding that responses on political issues can differ significantly.DeepSeek offers a free chatbot across web and mobile platforms and allows developers to modify and build on its core engine. According to the report, the absence of subscription fees has “lowered the barrier for millions of users, especially in price-sensitive regions”.The report found that DeepSeek’s adoption remained limited in North America and Europe, where several governments have raised security concerns. Countries including the US, Germany and Australia have sought to restrict its use, and Microsoft last year banned its own employees from using the platform.By contrast, DeepSeek’s usage surged in China and in countries such as Russia, Iran, Cuba and Belarus — regions where access to US-based technology platforms is restricted. In many markets, its adoption was linked to being pre-installed or promoted on smartphones from Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei.DeepSeek’s estimated market share was about 89% in China, followed by Belarus at 56% and Cuba at 49%. In Russia, its share was around 43%, while in Iran and Syria it ranged between 23% and 25%. In several African countries, including Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Niger, its market share stood between 11% and 14%.“Open-source AI can function as a geopolitical instrument, extending Chinese influence in areas where Western platforms cannot easily operate,” the report said.","Global adoption of generative AI tools reached 16.3% of the world’s population in the three months to December, up from 15.1% in the preceding quarter. However, AI adoption in developed economies — described by Microsoft as the “global north’ — is growing at nearly twice the pace of adoption in developing countries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126419321,imgsize-806836,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Boeing’s role in the Flight 1282 door plug blowout

Claims of blame shifting



The investigation and next steps

Captain Brandon Fisher, the pilot of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, has filed a $10 million lawsuit against Boeing. He alleges the company wrongly blamed him and his first officer for the door plug blowout that forced an emergency landing in January 2024. The lawsuit was filed on December 30, 2025, in an Oregon court and relates to a Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft.In court filings tied to a separate passenger class-action lawsuit, Boeing denied liability for the blowout. The company argued the aircraft may have been “improperly maintained or misused by persons and or entities other than Boeing.” Fisher’s lawyers say this language effectively shifted blame onto the flight crew despite the lack of evidence against them.The incident occurred on January 5, 2024. Flight 1282 suffered a door plug panel blowout shortly after take-off from Portland. The aircraft was flying at about 16,000 feet and had 177 people on board. Fisher and first officer Emily Wiprud landed the plane safely back in Portland.Investigators later found that bolts meant to secure the door plug panel were missing. The aircraft had undergone factory repairs linked to parts supplied by Spirit AeroSystems.The work was not properly documented and no inspection followed. Investigators said the evidence pointed to manufacturing and quality control failures rather than pilot error.Fisher alleges Boeing’s legal position contradicted its earlier public statements. After the incident, the crew received praise from regulators, the airline and company officials for landing the aircraft safely. The lawsuit argues that Boeing later reversed course in court to protect itself from liability.Fisher says the statements caused emotional distress and harmed his reputation. He says he became the target of passenger lawsuits and public criticism. The lawsuit seeks $10 million in damages.The door plug failure remains under investigation by federal authorities, including the National Transportation Safety Board. Boeing has declined to comment on Fisher’s lawsuit, citing ongoing litigation. Alaska Airlines thanked the flight crew for their actions but did not address the legal claims. Spirit AeroSystems is also named as a defendant.The case is pending in Multnomah County, Oregon. No trial date has been announced.","Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 suffered a door plug panel blowout shortly after take-off from Portland.

Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings



Posters, paperwork and early marketing

A wide-ranging collection of Steve Jobs’ childhood belongings and some of Apple’s earliest products has gone up for auction as the company approaches its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2026. The sale is being handled by RR Auction, which has opened bidding on 191 items spanning Jobs’ early life and Apple’s formative period in the mid-1970s.Among the centrepieces of the auction is the first known cheque issued by Apple Computer, Inc. on March 16, 1976. Signed by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the $500 cheque was made out to Howard Cantin, who designed the printed circuit board for the Apple-1 computer. The document predates Apple’s official incorporation and is described by the auction house as a foundational artefact from the company’s earliest days.Also drawing strong interest is the earliest known prototype motherboard for the Apple-1, alongside other rare hardware from Apple’s pre-Macintosh era. Early bidding has already pushed some items into the tens of thousands of dollars, with expectations that final prices could climb far higher.The auction also includes a functional Lisa-1 computer, a key transitional machine that preceded Apple’s Macintosh line, as well as a first-generation iPhone that was later jailbroken by teenage hacker George Hotz.Together, the items trace Apple’s evolution from a garage-based start-up to a consumer electronics giant.Adding a more personal dimension, the collection features items from Jobs’ childhood and teenage years, provided to the auction house by his stepbrother, John Chovanec.

More trouble looms ahead for India as Donald Trump greenlights harsher sanctions bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/more-trouble-looms-ahead-for-india-as-donald-trump-greenlights-harsher-sanctions-bill/articleshow/126416809.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

Trump Clears Russia Sanctions Bill, 500% Tariff Threat Looms As India Reworks Oil Import Strategy

With no end in sight for Washington’s tariff tangle with India, more trouble and torture is looming ahead for New Delhi after MAGA supremo Donald Trump on Wednesday greenlit a sweeping bipartisan legislation that will authorize him to impose primary and secondary sanctions and punitive tariffs up to 500 percent on Moscow and countries that continue to buy energy from Russia.The proposed Sanctioning Russia Act, simply called the Graham-Blumenthal bill after the two Senators sponsoring it, would significantly escalate economic pressure on Russia and countries such as China, India, and Brazil, all part of the BRICS block, which have so far withstood current US sanctions and tariffs. By legislatively empowering the President beyond his current executive authority, lawmakers in conjunction with the White House are also trying to get ahead of a US Supreme Court ruling in the tariff case – expected sometime this month – that is widely expected to go against the administration.“This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries who buy cheap Russian oil fueling Putin’s war machine…give him tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil that provides the financing for Putin’s bloodbath against Ukraine,” Graham wrote in a post on X after a meeting with the President where he said Trump greenlit passage of the legislation.He said there could be “a strong bipartisan vote, hopefully as early as next week.”The legislation grew out of mounting frustration in the White House and Congress that existing sanctions have failed to change the Kremlin’s behavior. Graham and Blumenthal, long among the Senate’s most outspoken advocates for Ukraine, argue that Russia has adapted to earlier measures by rerouting energy exports to willing buyers at discounted prices. By targeting those buyers directly with even higher tariffs and sanctions, they say, Washington can close the loopholes that have allowed Moscow to keep financing its war.The bill enjoys significant bipartisan backing in Congress. Introduced in September 2025, it advanced through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in October 2025 by a strong vote, signaling broad consensus. By December, with 85 cosponsors in the Senate alone, it spurred companion legislation in the House even as the Trump tariffs, imposed through executive power, were challenged and rejected in lower courts before it reached the Supreme Court.Trump, who was initially reluctant to back the legislation believing he had enough executive authority appears to have changed course after the judicial setbacks. In comments during a golf outing with Graham in late 2025, he had expressed support for tougher sanctions but urged caution to avoid derailing negotiations with Putin, whom he has attempted to engage for a peace deal. He reportedly insisted on reviewing the final text of the legislation, emphasizing that it should not ""tank the global economy"" while targeting Russia's oil revenues.Trump’s endorsement on Wednesday marks a shift from earlier ambivalence, where he prioritized diplomacy over escalation. While concerns remain about potential economic fallout of the legislation on the U.S itself, including solidifying the BRICS bloc and accelerating their de-dollarization efforts, the momentum behind the bill reflects a rare convergence of Republican and Democratic views on Russia.","The proposed Sanctioning Russia Act, simply called the Graham-Blumenthal bill after the two Senators sponsoring it, would significantly escalate economic pressure on Russia and countries such as China, India, and Brazil.

Can Venezuela actually deliver?

The takeaway

When US President Donald Trump floated the idea of Washington receiving millions of barrels of oil from Venezuela, it sounded like a throwback to an older energy playbook: pump more oil, cut fuel prices, make voters happy. The reality is far messier.The plan being discussed involves the US receiving 30–50 million barrels of Venezuelan crude, alongside American investment to help revive Venezuela’s oil production. That oil would then be sold on global markets, adding supply and, in theory, keeping prices low.The timing matters. Oil prices are already under pressure globally, and petrol prices have eased after years of inflation-driven pain. The Venezuela pitch is being sold as a way to lock that relief in.Venezuela holds the largest proven oil reserves in the world. On paper, it should be an energy superpower. In practice, years of mismanagement, sanctions, and infrastructure collapse have hollowed out its industry.The state oil company, PDVSA, has struggled to maintain wells, pipelines, and refineries. Skilled workers have fled. Equipment is outdated.Even modest production increases take time, money, and political stability, all of which are in short supply.Not automatically. Oil prices are set globally, not bilaterally. Even tens of millions of barrels spread over months are small in a market that consumes roughly 100 million barrels a day worldwide. Venezuelan oil would add to supply at the margins, not overwhelm the system.Prices are already low largely because of global oversupply and cautious demand, including production decisions by OPEC. Venezuelan barrels might help keep prices soft, but they are unlikely to be the main driver.Cheap petrol is good politics, but it comes with trade-offs.Lower oil prices squeeze US shale producers, many of whom operate close to break-even. Prolonged weakness risks layoffs, stalled drilling, and reduced investment in oil-heavy regions such as Texas and North Dakota.Unlike in the past, the US is now a major oil producer and exporter. That means falling prices no longer deliver an unambiguous economic win. Gains for consumers increasingly cancel out losses in the energy sector.This is the biggest uncertainty. Venezuela has repeatedly overpromised and underdelivered on production targets. Power shortages, decaying infrastructure, regulatory uncertainty, and political risk remain structural obstacles. Any agreement is also vulnerable to sanctions enforcement, legal challenges, and shifts in US or Venezuelan politics.Even with fresh investment, Venezuela cannot rapidly ramp up production at a scale that reshapes global markets.Venezuela may help keep oil markets loose at the edges, but it is not a magic lever for cheap gas. Fuel prices today are low because of global dynamics, not because Caracas is back as an energy heavyweight.For consumers, relief may last. For US oil producers, pressure is building. And for Venezuela, the promise of an oil-fuelled revival remains far more aspirational than assured.","Venezuela may help keep oil markets loose at the edges, but it is not a magic lever for cheap gas.

Alert student loan borrowers! Trump admin issues notices to federal defaulters – Check details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/alert-student-loan-borrowers-trump-admin-issues-notices-to-federal-defaulters-check-details/articleshow/126407745.cms,"US Issues Blunt Warning To Indian Students: Breaking Laws May Cost Visas, Careers And Future Dreams

Trump administration is preparing to once again dock wages from Americans who have defaulted on their federal student loans, bringing an end to the pandemic-era relief that had paused such collections.The department of education will started sending out warning letters to borrowers in default, from Wednesday, signalling the return of wage garnishment. A department spokesperson told FOX Business, ""we expect the first notices to be sent to approximately 1,000 defaulted borrowers the week of January 7, and the notices will increase in scale on a month-to-month basis.""During the pandemic, borrowers who had fallen behind on their student loans were protected from aggressive recovery measures. Howeve, that protection has now lapsed, reopening the door for the government to recover dues directly from pay cheques. Borrowers in default face the possibility of losing up to 15% of their after-tax income, while tax refunds and some federal benefits may also be withheld. However, federal rules ensure that a minimum amount of weekly income remains untouched, FOX Business reported.Before any money is taken, borrowers must be given a 30-day notice period.This time is meant to allow individuals to clear their dues, challenge the move, or explore alternatives. The notices outline options such as entering into a voluntary repayment plan or requesting a formal hearing.At these hearings, borrowers can question whether the debt exists, whether the amount is accurate, or whether it can legally be enforced. They may also argue that garnishing 15% of their disposable income would cause severe financial hardship. In certain cases, borrowers can ask for a ruling on whether garnishment should apply if they have been in a new job for less than 12 months following an involuntary loss of employment.Consumer groups point out that wage garnishment is not inevitable. Borrowers can reach out to the federal government, request a hearing, or enrol in loan rehabilitation or consolidation programmes to stop the process.Federal law also protects workers from being sacked, denied employment or penalised because of wage garnishment. Borrowers can take legal action against employers who act against them on this basis. Employers, meanwhile, are only entitled to receive the minimum information required to carry out the wage withholding and nothing more.The move comes as millions remain stuck in default. More than five million federal student loan borrowers have already fallen behind, and officials within the Trump administration have warned that the figure could climb further as repayment programmes are reworked.According to education department data, 5.3 million borrowers were in default as of June 2025, accounting for 7% of the $1.58 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",Department of education will start sending out warning letters to borrowers in default.

Traders in Asia largely paused trading activity as they awaited US figures on job openings and weekly unemployment claims later in the day, followed on Friday by the closely watched non-farm payrolls report. The data is expected to play a central role in shaping expectations for the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting at the end of the month, amid debate over whether interest rates could be cut for a fourth consecutive time.Geopolitical developments also weighed on sentiment, with investors assessing the fallout from the United States’ toppling of Venezuela’s president, alongside ongoing tensions between China and Japan.Japanese stocks came under particular pressure after China announced an anti-dumping investigation into imports from Japan of a key chemical used in semiconductor manufacturing. The move followed Beijing’s decision a day earlier to ban exports to Japan of goods with potential military applications, further straining relations between the two countries. Diplomatic tensions have been elevated since Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in November that Japan could respond militarily to any attack on Taiwan.In commodities, oil prices edged higher after recording a second consecutive sharp fall on Wednesday. The earlier decline followed reports that Venezuela would ship millions of barrels of crude to the United States after President Nicolas Maduro was removed from office over the weekend.Meanwhile, investors are also watching for a Supreme Court ruling due on Friday concerning the legality of Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, a landmark case that challenges the US president’s unprecedented use of powers to impose global levies and strikes at the core of his economic agenda.","In Hong Kong, the HSI was down 322 points or 1.22%, to trade at 26,136.

"California loses $160M for delaying revocation of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses for immigrants",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/california-loses-160m-for-delaying-revocation-of-17000-commercial-drivers-licenses-for-immigrants/articleshow/126405376.cms,"AP image

California will lose $160 million for delaying the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses for immigrants, federal transportation officials announced Wednesday.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy already withheld $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.The state notified these drivers in the fall that they would lose their licenses after a federal audit found problems that included licenses for truckers and bus drivers that remained valid long after an immigrant's visa expired. Some licenses were also given to citizens of Mexico and Canada who don't qualify. More than one-quarter of the small sample of California licenses that investigators reviewed were unlawful.But then last week California said it would delay those revocations until March after immigrant groups sued the state because of concerns that some groups were being unfairly targeted. Duffy said the state was supposed to revoke those licenses by Monday.Duffy is pressuring California and other states to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren't granted the licenses.""Our demands were simple: follow the rules, revoke the unlawfully-issued licenses to dangerous foreign drivers, and fix the system so this never happens again,"" Duffy said in a written statement. ""(Gov.) Gavin Newsom has failed to do so - putting the needs of illegal immigrants over the safety of the American people.""Newsom's office did not immediately respond after the action was announced Wednesday afternoon.Enforcement ramped up after fatal crashes The federal government began cracking down during the summer. The issue became prominent after a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, New York, Texas, South Dakota, Colorado, and Washington after audits found significant problems under the existing rules, including commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver's work permit expired. He had dropped the threat to withhold nearly $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses.Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Administrator Derek Barrs said California failed to live up to the promise it made in November to revoke all the flawed licenses by Jan. 5. The agency said the state also unilaterally decide to delay until March the cancellations of roughly 4,700 additional unlawful licenses that were discovered after the initial ones were found.""We will not accept a corrective plan that knowingly leaves thousands of drivers holding noncompliant licenses behind the wheel of 80,000-pound trucks in open defiance of federal safety regulations,"" Barrs said.Industry praises the enforcement Trucking trade groups have praised the effort to get unqualified drivers who shouldn't have licenses or can't speak English off the road. They also applauded the Transportation Department's moves to go after questionable commercial driver's license schools.""For too long, loopholes in this program have allowed unqualified drivers onto our highways, putting professional truckers and the motoring public at risk,"" said Todd Spencer, president of the Owner Operator Independent Drivers Association.The spotlight has been on Sikh truckers because the driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs. So the Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the California drivers. They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted.Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but these non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver's licenses or about 200,000 drivers. The Transportation Department also proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license, but a court put the new rules on hold.",Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy already withheld $40 million in federal funding.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%.Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

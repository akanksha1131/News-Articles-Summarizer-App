Top stock market recommendations : According to Aakash K Hindocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, LIC Housing Finance, Bank of Baroda and UPL are the top buy calls for today. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks for March 20, 2025:The index is trying to get back its mojo with Nifty gaining close to 600 points from its opening level on Monday. The index had reclaimed its resistance of 22450 last week and has completed its initial target of 22800. NR7 formation is also seen on Nifty wherein the index is trading within a narrow range of less than 2% for 7 consecutive days. A breakout from the same has been seen on Tuesday, and is likely to allow for a 2% move higher from the breakout point of 22650 odd. Hence, to sum up the index is now aiming for a target of 23150 odd. Any dips below 22800 are likely to get bought into.Bank Nifty has gained traction after reversing from its 9 month low which was hit last week. The index has completed its immediate target of 49,000 after it popped out from its consolidation range of the previous week. The index now hails forward to hit 49800 / 50200 as it has reclaimed an immediate resistance of 49000 and the same is now likely to act as support. Any dips near the 49000 mark can be used to add fresh longs for the mentioned target on the upside.After finding strong demand near the 61.8% retracement of its previous uptrend, LIC Housing Finance has broken out of a nine-month downward-sloping trendline on the daily chart. With bullish momentum building, the stock appears poised to test its prior swing high around the 600 level.BANKBARODA is at the cusp of an inverse head and shoulder breakout on the 4-hourly chart. Price is also holding its stance after breaking above the falling channel. The structure is well-set and can push prices to travel towards the aforementioned pattern's target near 235-240 levels.UPL has retraced 38.2% of its prior rally, forming a classic flag-and-pole pattern. On the daily chart, the stock has decisively broken out of this consolidation, confirming the pattern with strong follow-through. With momentum building, further upside movement appears likely.","Aakash Kocha, Deputy Vice President - WM Research, Nuvama Professional Clients Group, LIC Housing Finance, Bank of Baroda and UPL are the top buy calls for today.

Santander UK's announcement on Wednesday that it plans to shut a fifth of its branch network has raised concerns about the bank's future in the UK. The move, which could result in around 750 job losses consist of the closure of 95 out of 444 branches by June.The bank which has faced speculation over its long-term presence in the UK, will retain 349 branches, including 290 full-service locations and 36 branches with reduced hours. Like many other UK banks, Santander has been scaling back its physical presence as customers increasingly turn to digital banking, reported news agency Reuters.Since 2019, the bank has reported a 63% rise in digital transactions, while in-branch financial transactions have declined by 61% over the same period. Despite this, the closures have sparked criticism from UK lawmakers, who argue that they harm local businesses and make it more difficult for vulnerable customers in rural areas to access banking services.In response to these concerns, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced new rules in September to make it more difficult for banks to close branches without ensuring that customers have free access to cash alternatives.Santander UK explained that the decision to close branches was part of its strategy to align with customer behaviour. ""As a business, we must move with customers and balance our investment across all the places where we interact with them,"" said the bank. ""Closing a branch is always a very difficult decision, and we spend a great deal of time assessing where and when we do this and how to minimize the impact on our customers.""The bank added that it is consulting with employee unions and will provide support to affected staff, including assistance with finding alternative roles within the bank.In its most recent financial report, Santander UK posted a 38% drop in annual pre-tax profit, totalling £1.33 billion ($1.73 billion) in 2024. The bank employs approximately 18,000 people.Despite reports in January suggesting that Barclays had explored a potential offer for Santander UK's operations, the parent company reiterated last month that its UK unit remains a key part of its globally diversified business strategy and is not for sale.",Santander UK plans to shut a fifth of its branch network by June.

MUMBAI: India remains the most cost-effective destination for remittances, yet recipients still lose around 5% of the money sent by relatives abroad in transfer costs.According to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) study, the global average cost of sending $200 has fallen (from nearly 9.7% in 2009 to around 6.7% in Q2 2024) but remains above the G20's 5% target and the UN's 3% Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). These costs include fees and exchange-rate markups.India has, however, met the G20 target. Remittance costs were 4.9% in 2023, and just over 5% in the first half of 2024 - below the global average. India is the top recipient, followed by Mexico, China, the Philippines, France, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.Digital remittances, which were 30% of transactions in Q2 2024, are cheaper. India's digital transfers averaged 4%, a percentage point below the national average, ""reflecting the rising role of digitalisation in optimising remittance costs"".Smaller transfers are pricier. Remittances under $200 averaged 4.6%, while $200-$500 transfers were 2.4%. Fintech firms and money-transfer operators (MTOs) offer the lowest costs, increasing competition.Advanced economies (AEs) now account for over half of India's $118 billion in FY24 remittances, while Gulf states make up 38%.","India remains the most cost-effective destination for remittances.

Microsoft Corp, the biggest backer of Sam Altman's OpenAI , and BlackRock Inc, which has an executive on the artificial intelligence startup's board, are joining forces with one of his chief rivals.Microsoft and BlackRock said on Wednesday that Elon Musk's xAI is joining their effort to build $30 billion worth of data centers and other artificial intelligence infrastructure. The AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp, which was already named as a technical adviser to the group when it was announced last year, is also formally joining, according to a statement that didn't detail member commitments.Microsoft, which has invested about $13 billion in OpenAI, has increasingly been developing AI outside of that partnership. The software giant has created in-house AI models that it believes can compete with OpenAI, Bloomberg reported this month. Musk, also a co-founder of OpenAI, has meanwhile publicly feuded with Altman over the company's efforts to shift to a for-profit structure.The capital demands and enthusiasm for AI have prompted a range of companies and investors to forge alliances to build some of the biggest data centre campuses in the world. US President Donald Trump has touted hundreds of billions of dollars worth of commitments from firms including Softbank Group and OpenAI, which are behind a $100 billion AI investment plan dubbed Stargate.The Microsoft-backed group will be renamed the AI Infrastructure Partnership , or AIP, and focus on infrastructure investments - including energy projects - mostly in the US, with a portion of the funds to be deployed in partner countries, according to the companies. The plan foresees bringing on additional investors. Clients, including pensions and insurers, are eager for such long-term infrastructure projects, BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink said in the statement.BlackRock and Microsoft last year unveiled the coalition in partnership with MGX, a UAE investment vehicle that is also involved in Stargate, and Bayo Ogunlesi's Global Infrastructure Partners. The companies said at the time they would seek $30 billion of private equity capital over an unspecified time frame and eventually leverage as much as $100 billion in potential investments.","Microsoft and BlackRock said on Wednesday that Elon Musk's xAI is joining their effort to build $30 billion worth of data centers and other artificial intelligence infrastructure.

MUMBAI: Stocks of most of the domestic steel manufacturers rallied on Wednesday after the commerce ministry recommended a 12% safeguard duty on certain steel products for 200 days, to protect the domestic industry from an spurt in imports. Automobile stocks, that use imported as well as domestically produced steel, faced some selling, on fears that their input costs may rise although analysts don't see any immediate hike in steel prices for users.Among the leaders from the steel manufacturing sector, SAIL rallied to close 4% up, while Tata Steel gained 2.5% and JSW Steel 1.4%. Among the auto sector leaders, the stock price of Maruti Suzuki closed 0.9% lower and M&M was down a marginal 0.2%. On the other hand, Hyundai Motors India was up 2.2% and Tata Motors 0.3%.According to a report by global financial major JP Morgan, the long-awaited safeguard duty was a positive for the Indian steel industry. ""Once implemented, this should increase the landed cost of imports by Rs 5,500-per-ton. But the effective increase in domestic HRC prices could be lower at Rs 2,000/ton,"" it said.Analysts feel target prices of stocks of steel manufacturers could be revised upwards for FY26.""Steel stocks have been rallying of late, led by optimism around China steel output cuts, German infra fund announcement and safeguard duty imposition. Expect stock prices to react positively as it opens up ample room for imagination around profitability improvement and govt's strong intent to support the steel sector,"" the report said.There's a possibility that non-integrated producers would gain more from the duty than the integrated producers. Also, there's unlikely to be any immediate hike in domestic prices of steel for users since these prices are already at a premium to import prices, said Shrikant Chouhan, head equity research, Kotak Securities.""Domestic prices are at a 7-8% premium to import parity, leaving little room for further hikes in the former case. In the past few weeks, Vietnam, South Korea, Europe and the US have imposed/increased tariff barriers against steel imports, whereas investigations are ongoing in a couple of countries, including India,"" Chouhan wrote in a note. ""Steel margins have bottomed out in 3QFY25, and we expect a recovery in 4QFY25, with price hikes and muted costs. However, further expansion is dependent on trade measures and supply-side reforms by China.""","The commerce ministry recommended a 12% safeguard duty on certain steel products for 200 days. Automobile stocks, that use imported as well as domestically produced steel, faced some selling. SAIL rallied to close 4% up, while Tata Steel gained 2.5% and JSW Steel 1.4%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

BENGALURU: The IT sector is trudging in the slow lane, operating at a lacklustre pace. Industry analysts forecast a slower pace of recovery with moderate growth for a longer period, even as the IT sector faces potential challenges stemming from the macro-economic environment and technology transition, increasing risks to revenue growth. This presents a case for a weak multiplier effect, leading to subdued growth for Indian IT firms.Analysts have also observed that growth rates are becoming polarised among various players, primarily influenced by company-specific developments. ""Change in tech cycle is likely to create a transition phase for tech services companies (like 2016/17), causing growth to moderate in short term. We are lowering our dollar revenue growth forecasts by 100-200 bps and expect growth of 4.5% in FY26 and 6% in FY27 for large-cap IT companies,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a recent report.Jeffries said it has changed stance on IT sector to underweight (from overweight) due to rising growth worries in the US. ""Weakened US growth outlook is reflected in US 10-year bond yield decline and higher Fed rate cut expectations. Moreover, with the US Dollar Index now down 4.2% in one month, the pressure on the Rupee may reduce going forward, which was a margin tailwind for IT companies,"" a note said.Morgan Stanley said IT stocks have corrected by 6%-18% (vs sensex 6%). ""Despite drop, relative valuations vs sensex are still at five-year average (14.5% premium vs 5-year average of 14.4%). We see risks to consensus revenue estimates and a potential de-rating risk for multiples back to long-term average.""Morgan Stanley said tech shifts would open up newer opportunities, but growth will slw down in initial transition period. Its report highlighted examples of new addressable market opportunities, such as modernisation of a legacy technology stack of applications using Gen AI technology, data and analytics work related to both structured and unstructured data and automation of basic-level jobs creating efficiency benefits such as contact centre operations.","Analysts have also observed that growth rates are becoming polarised among various players.

MUMBAI: India's economy continues to display remarkable resilience amid global uncertainty, with growth underpinned by strong agricultural output and recovering consumption, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) noted in its State of the Economy report.Key sectors - including agriculture, construction, financial services, and trade - remain buoyant. The country is benefitting from easing inflation, robust tax revenues, and sustained strength in services exports.Meanwhile, the central bank has responded nimbly to liquidity shortages. According to the report, RBI has pumped in over Rs 5.3 lakh crore of durable liquidity through bond repurchases, forex swaps and long-term repos.""The first revised estimates (FRE) of GDP for FY24 placed the real GDP growth at 9.2% - the highest in over a decade if we exclude the post-Covid rebound - demonstrating that in an uncertain world, India's growth story remains a beacon of stability and progress,"" the report observed.Inflation has moderated, with headline CPI falling to a seven-month low of 3.6% in Feb. ""The decline in overall inflation is expected to further support recovery in consumption and bolster macroeconomic strength, which would act as a bulwark to ward off the myriad of external challenges,"" the report added.Leading indicators suggest that demand remains robust in the final quarter of FY25. ""Activity indicators such as e-way bills and toll collections recorded double-digit (y-o-y) growth in Feb 2025,"" the report noted.Yet risks abound. The report flags escalating trade tensions, tariff uncertainty, and a potential global slowdown as key threats. India remains exposed to external shocks via trade, capital flows, and currency movements. Geopolitical tensions and protectionist policies could dampen growth and push inflation higher. ""The reverberations of a tumultuous external environment, however, are being reflected in sustained foreign portfolio outflows ,"" the report cautioned.","Growth underpinned by strong agricultural output and recovering consumption.

NEW DELHI: The commerce ministry has recommended a 12% safeguard duty on some specific steel products for 200 days to protect the domestic industry, which has been facing the brunt of a sudden spike in imports.""...Authority considers that a provisional safeguard duty of 12% will be appropriate to eliminate serious injury and threat to the domestic industry,"" the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), an investigative arm of the commerce ministry, said in its report. The proposed duty would be applicable on non-alloy and alloy steel flat products.The investigation was launched after a petition was filed by the Indian Steel Association (ISA), representing some leading domestic producers, alleging a sharp increase in imports causing serious harm to the domestic steel industry.The DGTR in its report said trade diversion due to protective measures imposed by the US has been a major cause behind surge in imports. To counter the effect of trade diversion from the US into European Union (EU) countries, EU imposed a 25% safeguard duty in 2018. It also said several other countries like South Africa, Turkey, Vietnam, Malaysia, Tunisia have also raised barriers for import of steel products.""To counter the trade diversion from the US as well as any possible diversion from other countries that have put in place import barriers to counter trade diversion any protective measure by India shall be at a level adequate to ward off trade diversion,"" according to the report.The authority has invited comments on preliminary findings from all interested parties within 30 days and will have a hearing before making a final decision.""The preliminary report suggests a strong push towards imposing safeguard duties on steel imports to protect domestic manufacturers,"" said Ajay Srivastava, head of think tank GTRI. ""However, procedural shortcomings, economic inconsistencies, and international trade conflicts raise significant concerns about the legitimacy of the proposed measures. The final decision will depend on further investigations, stakeholder responses, and compliance with international trade norms. If imposed, the safeguard duties may face challenges at both domestic and global trade forums,"" said Srivastava.",The commerce ministry has recommended a 12% safeguard duty on some specific steel products for 200 days.

ICICI Securities has maintained its ‘buy’ rating on Grasim Industries with a target price of Rs 3,093. Analysts said that the management is confident of further ramp-up of its new paint business . Flushed with initial success of product/brand acceptability in the market, Grasim is on track to meet its guidance of seizing a high-single-digit industry market share . Further, buoyed by the success of its economy product range, Grasim is all set to make its mark in the premium decorative paint segment. With expected scale-up in institutional segment sales and broader endeavour to operate at optimal capacity utilisation, Grasim reiterated its guidance of Rs 10,000 crore revenue and EBITDA breakeven in FY28.Macquarie has put an ‘outperform’ rating on Tata Motors with a target price of Rs 826. Analysts feel the key drivers to track would be the management's confidence on delivering JLR's net cash balance sheet by March 2025, healthy growth outlook for the US along with signs of recovery in the EU and the UK, partly offset by volume risk in China, and market-share gains in the domestic CV segment.Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a ‘neutral’ rating on One97 Communications (PayTM) with a target price of Rs 870. Analysts said they remain watchful on the challenging macro-environment, traction in the financial distribution business and near-term UPI market share. They feel in case a merchant discount rate is introduced on UPI payments, that will be a significant boost to PayTM’s revenue and will incentivize the company to push for market share gains in the consumer payments.JM Financial has initiated coverage of Tata Communications with a ‘buy’ rating and a target price of Rs 2,030. Analysts are bullish on the company’s data business as they expect data segment EBITDA to grow at a robust CAGR of ~21% over FY24-28 (Expected). They feel the key risks to the stock’s target price are weak global macro leading to deferment in discretionary tech spends and adverse AGR ruling.InCred Equities has an ‘add’ rating on Pidilite Industries with a target price of Rs 3,470. Analysts feel the company is building focused portfolios and separate teams aided growth in underserved markets. Distribution expansion and the innovation engine will continue to drive growth.

MUMBAI: In a significant decision, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), Mumbai bench, distinguished between a legal owner (an individual whose name is merely added on purchase of a property, say a spouse or brother) and a beneficial owner (to whom it actually belongs).The ITAT emphasized that merely having a name on a property title does not necessarily confer ownership if there is clear evidence to the contrary. Thus, on sale of the property, where the proceeds flow solely to the beneficial owner, the individual whose name has been merely added is not obliged to pay tax on capital gains.Often, when a property is purchased, the name of another family member is added out of ‘love and affection' – such as to provide a degree of security to a spouse. However, on sale of such property, tax demands are raised even on the legal owner for his or her share of capital gains tax . This ITAT order in the case of V N Jain will benefit taxpayers facing a similar situation.In this case, V N Jain held a property jointly with his brother, which was sold for Rs 54 lakh during the financial year 2014-15.The Income-Tax (I-T) officer observed that there did not exist any family arrangement under which Jain has relinquished his right to the property prior to the sale. Thus, he held that Jain's share of the sale proceeds of Rs 27 lakh would be taxable in his hands as capital gains.Capital gains is the sales consideration minus the indexed cost of acquisition. When Jain filed an appeal, the appellate commissioner granted a partial relief by holding that capital gains should be computed after deducting the proportionate share of cost of acquisition of the property from the sum of Rs 27 lakhs. Capital gains tax would be payable only on the net sum arrived at. Jain then approached the ITAT.Before the tax appelate tribunal, he submitted that the property sold was originally purchased by his brother, who had full possession and rights over it. His name was added as a joint owner out of natural love and affection. The ITAT bench reviewed the evidence submitted such as purchase deeds, and the brother's bank statement. It also observed that the brother had declared the entire sale consideration in his own I-T returns.The ITAT observed that Jain had neither paid for the property nor received any proceeds from the sale. Thus, no capital gains tax liability could be imposed on him.Tax experts have welcomed the order of ITAT, stating that it upholds the principles of natural justice and also prevents unjust taxation on individuals who are not the real beneficiaries of an asset.","In a significant decision, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), Mumbai bench, distinguished between a legal owner and a beneficial owner.

Impact of tariffs and economic policies

Adjusting bond holdings to stabilise markets

Inflation and consumer sentiment

Slower growth ahead



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





The federal reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, keeping it unchanged for the second consecutive meeting, while signalling that it still expects to cut rates twice before the end of the year. However, officials acknowledged growing uncertainty in the economic outlook as inflation shows signs of persistence and growth projections weaken.In its latest quarterly economic forecast, the Fed revised its expectations for economic growth, predicting a slower expansion this year and next compared to previous estimates. The central bank also anticipates a slight increase in the unemployment rate, projecting it to rise to 4.4% by the end of 2025. Inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% target, is expected to climb to 2.7% this year from its current level of 2.5%.""Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,"" Fed noted in its post-meeting statement, highlighting the delicate balance policymakers must strike. While rising inflation would typically prompt the Fed to keep rates elevated or even raise them, slowing growth and rising unemployment could necessitate rate cuts to support the economy.The decision to hold rates steady comes as the central bank assesses the broader impact of the Trump administration's economic policies, particularly tariffs. Economists predict that new trade barriers could temporarily push inflation higher, while other measures, such as deregulation, may offset some of those effects by reducing costs.Fed chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that tariffs have begun to influence inflation, particularly through higher costs on imported goods.""I do think with the arrival of tariff inflation, further progress [on lowering inflation] is probably delayed,"" Powell said during a news conference.Alongside the rate decision, Fed announced a slowdown in the pace at which it is reducing its holdings of US treasury securities.Previously, the central bank allowed $25 billion in treasuries to mature each month without reinvesting the proceeds. Now, it will reinvest more aggressively, limiting the monthly runoff to just $5 billion.This move aims to keep long-term borrowing costs lower by stabilizing Treasury yields, which dipped slightly following the announcement.Despite Fed's efforts to manage inflation, concerns are growing among economists and consumers alike. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that inflation could climb to 3% by the end of the year, up from 2.6% currently, largely driven by import taxes.Consumer sentiment also reflects growing caution, with recent surveys indicating that Americans expect inflation to worsen. If these expectations persist, they could lead to self-fulfilling price increases as people rush to make purchases before costs rise further. Retailers and homebuilders have already signalled potential price hikes on goods and services due to the added pressure of tariffs.While inflation remains a key concern, signs of economic slowdown are also emerging. The economy has shown weaker growth in early 2025, with Barclays cutting its GDP forecast to just 0.7%, down from an earlier projection of 2.5% in 2024.With inflation still above target, growth slowing, and tariffs complicating the economic landscape, the Fed's path forward remains uncertain. Policymakers have signalled rate cuts on the horizon, but the timing and extent of those reductions will depend on how economic conditions evolve in the coming months.","The federal reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, keeping it unchanged for the second consecutive meeting.

The EU will reduce steel imports by a further 15 percent from April, the bloc's industry chief said Wednesday, to prevent a wave of cheap steel flooding the market after the United States imposed new levies.US President Donald Trump slapped 25-percent tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium, raising fears of the knock-on effects for Europe's beleaguered steel industry, already facing fierce competition from Asia and high energy prices.""On April 1, we will reinforce the current safeguard clause. We're aiming for a drop of up to 15 percent in imports,"" European Commission vice president Stephane Sejourne said as he unveiled a medley of measures to protect the metals sector.The commission already has safeguard measures -- including import limits -- in place to protect the steel industry, that will continue until 2026.The European steel industry currently employs more than 300,000 people -- but has lost almost 100,000 jobs in the past 15 years. Industry group Eurofer welcomed the measures.""We are grateful that the Commission has clearly recognised the strategic importance of the European steel industry to the EU's sovereignty, security, and competitiveness,"" said Henrik Adam, Eurofer president.But he warned ""energy remains the elephant in the room"" and urged the EU to do more to reduce energy costs in Europe.Brussels will also launch an investigation into aluminium on the European market, ""with a view to introducing a safeguard clause similar to that for steel"", Sejourne said.The probe would look at whether there has been a sudden increase in aluminium imports, which could lead to import curbs.""US tariffs on aluminium are likely to worsen the situation further given the significant threat of trade diversion from multiple destinations,"" the commission said.","The EU will reduce steel imports by a further 15 percent from April, the bloc's industry chief says.

Indian airline IndiGo announced plans on Wednesday to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030 in an effort to capture a larger market share.The no-frills carrier intends to raise its international capacity share—measured as the proportion of total available seat kilometres dedicated to international routes—from the current 28% to 40%, news agency Reuters reported. This shift marks a significant growth from just 14% in fiscal year 2018, achieved in a span of seven years.IndiGo currently flies to 40 international destinations and holds a 19% share of India’s international flight market, according to the latest data from the country’s aviation regulator. Following the announcement, shares of the airline rose by 4.2%.This international expansion comes as IndiGo seeks to diversify beyond its dominant domestic market, where it holds nearly 60% of the share. The move aligns with the broader trend of Indian carriers working to meet the growing demand for both domestic and international air travel, despite challenges related to aircraft supply.Earlier this year, IndiGo revealed plans to strengthen its international presence, which currently generates around 10% of its revenue. The airline also announced plans to lease a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Norse Atlantic Airways to expand its long-haul operations.IndiGo is looking to add business class seats to its Airbus A321XLR and A350 aircraft to further increase revenue, as business class tickets are priced roughly three times higher than economy class.The airline began offering business class seats on select domestic routes late last year, marking its first move away from an all-economy cabin model, and is positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for premium travel among Indian passengers.IndiGo also reaffirmed its goal of expanding its fleet to over 600 aircraft by 2030, up from approximately 437 currently.","Indian airline IndiGo plans to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030.

Google parent Alphabet agreed to acquire cloud security firm Wiz for $32 billion in cash, reaching a deal less than a year after initial negotiations fell apart because the cloud-computing startup wanted to stay independent.Wiz will join the Google Cloud business once the deal closes, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. The takeover is subject to regulatory approvals and is likely to close next year, they said.The deal, which would be Alphabet’s largest to date, comes after Wiz turned down a $23 billion bid from the internet search leader last year after several months of discussions. At the time, Wiz walked away after deciding it could ultimately be worth more by pursuing an initial public offering company. Concerns about regulatory challenges also influenced the decision.Shares of Alphabet fell nearly 3% in New York on Tuesday.The Wiz takeover is by far the largest M&A deal to be announced this year. Deal hungry companies and their advisers had initially predicted that US President Donald Trump’s policies would create better conditions for buying and selling, supercharging an M&A market that just got back on its feet after a lull. Instead, his tariff threats and geopolitical tensions have spooked markets and kept dealmakers in wait-and-see mode.Google framed the Wiz ac quisition as a way to beef up its cloud security offerings with new ways to keep their systems secure in a new era of Artificial Intelligence.“AI brings new risks, but also new opportunities,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a call with investors. “Organisations are looking for cybersecurity solutions that improve cloud security and span multiple clouds.”","Wiz will join the Google Cloud business once the deal closes, the companies said.

“The trends indicate that the jump in US economy post COVID may have been an outlier as a result of policy extravaganza…. Long trends indicate possible downturn in US economy,” says SBI in its latest report.

US Real GDP growth in long run

Drastically cutting Federal spending can be disastrous, says SBI report

What US economic data is pointing to

1) GDP growth trajectory:

The US economy has weakened over the past year, with GDP growth declining from 3.2% in Q4 2023 to 2.5% in Q4 2024, notes the SBI report.

2) Debt:

The debt to GDP ratio shows a secular rising trend, says SBI.

3) Reduced exports, consumption:

Extended analysis suggests a probable decline in US economic growth, accompanied by reduced exports and consumption.

4) Savings to GDP ratio:

US Consumer Spending Drop

5) Stock market mayhem:

P/E multiples are stretched for most markets

US economy: What’s the long-term outlook?

The US economy long-term trends in GDP indicate decline in potential GDP, demand and investments

The US indebtedness has sharply increased over the years, crowding out the private sector

Although high debt has not reflected in US dollar, which shows cyclical trends its strength has over the years has declined

The current tariff policy will have short term pain and US GDP will not see acceleration in material way

The economic rational of US DOGE is evident from long-term term trends

If the structural adjustment gains traction, then potential GDP trend can see a upward shift. The larger national savings that come from exercise despite nominal improvement in productivity can still push the potential GDP up. The crowding in of the private sector that follows along with technical progress can add significantly to growth prospects. However, this adjustment will have short term costs.

Is the US economy headed for a recession? A recession happens when an economy’s GDP contracts for two consecutive quarters. A recent SBI Research report says that the long term US GDP growth shows a declining trend.Concerns have risen about the economic outlook of the US post Trump’s tariff measures and cutting of spending and jobs. Economists view Trump's trade conflict as a potential threat to the American economy, with possible consequences of increased consumer costs, reduced economic growth and diminished employment opportunities.The report also cautions that, “the zealotry mission of departments like DOGE can undo a lot of ground works done in the previous decades, putting downward pressure on the beleaguered economy.” DOGE or the Department of Government Efficiency is an initiative of the US President Donald Trump and is headed by Tesla CEO and Trump advisor Elon Musk.The economic uncertainty looms large, particularly noteworthy as it follows a period when the US economy demonstrated remarkable strength whilst managing the COVID pandemic crisis. So is the US economy headed for a recession? We take a look at some important data pointers in the SBI report on and the expected trends in the US economy based on long-term history:Analysis of US GDP growth reveals a downward trajectory, particularly evident since 2000, says the SBI report. America’s economic indicators suggest a reduction in potential GDP, alongside weakening demand and investment patterns.“The GDP Now model estimate from Atlanta Fed for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate, running estimate) in the first quarter of 2025 is -2.4% on 06 Mar, down from +2.9% on 31 Jan (first estimate),” says the report.Rising national debt levels have become increasingly significant, resulting in diminished private sector participation. Current trade policies involving tariffs are expected to create immediate challenges, without substantial improvement in GDP performance.Post-COVID US economic growth appears exceptional, attributed to extensive policy measures.Total factor productivity growth is diminishing, while value addition shows negative progression. Elevated wage levels might deter future investments. The savings-to-GDP ratio has reached its lowest point since 2011, marking the second-lowest figure since 1951.January witnessed the first decline in consumer spending in nearly 24 months, whilst the goods trade deficit reached unprecedented levels due to businesses accelerating imports to avoid tariff implications, suggesting possible economic contraction this quarter. Consumer expenditure trends are expected to weaken in correlation with the projected overall GDP slowdown.The S&P 500 has given up its post-November election gains, with March 2025 projected to record the poorest monthly performance since the COVID-19 period.US markets, including the S&P with a market capitalisation of approximately 52.9 trillion (February 2025), appear to have reached their limits after delivering exceptional returns. Investors are reassessing earnings forecasts amidst persistent volatility. The prominent 'magnificent 7' stocks display vulnerability following the Deep Seek event, with traditionally stable companies like Apple facing scrutiny of their safe-haven status, says the SBI report.Investment flows are shifting towards more affordable markets as investors seek enhanced returns, evidenced by increased activity in mainland China and Hong Kong markets. Analysts anticipate possible corrections in overvalued markets. The ongoing series of reciprocal tariffs creates conditions for increased market instability in forthcoming periods.The SBI report says that positive structural adjustments could potentially elevate GDP trends. Despite modest productivity improvements, increased national savings could enhance potential GDP. Private sector re-engagement combined with technological advancements could boost growth prospects, though initial adaptation periods may present challenges. The SBI report notes the following:","Long trends indicate possible downturn in US economy, says SBI in its latest report. Long term trends in GDP indicate decline in potential GDP, demand and investments. US indebtedness has sharply increased over the years, crowding out the private sector. Current tariff policy will have short term pain.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119169633,imgsize-43404,width-400,resizemode-4/119169633.jpg"

Solana meme coins , once the stars of 2024, have seen their market caps decline in recent months. However, one standout project is defying the trend. Solaxy ’s crypto presale is rapidly approaching the $30 million mark, undeterred by the broader market downturn.Unlike typical meme coins, Solaxy aims to go beyond fleeting hype, positioning itself as a game-changer for the Solana ecosystem with its ambitious layer-2 scaling solution .The Solana meme coin market has been quiet for a while now. The tokens that captured massive attention in 2024 are losing value.BONK, for example, has seen a steep 45% drop on the monthly chart. From one of last year’s hottest tokens, it is at risk of being another forgetful meme coin.But it’s not just the Solana meme coin market that is suffering. Significant members of the market like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have also seen a sharp decline. The overall crypto market is in a downtrend, with Bitcoin slipping under $90,000. On top of that, Solana’s frequent congestion issues are driving users and developers away. While the network was a hot hub for meme coins in 2024, its rising transaction fees and slow processing times are making it less attractive for new projects. Solaxy brings real utility to the Solana network. It is developing Solana’s first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution.The project’s goal is to address the blockchain’s congestion issues head-on by processing transactions off-chain. After that, they are batched for final verification.The mechanism could significantly reduce the strain on Solana’s mainnet by lowering transaction fees and expediting processing speeds.Even during peak trading hours, Solaxy could help keep the network frictionless.Beyond scalability, Solaxy has bigger ambitions. According to its white paper, the project plans to introduce cross-chain functionality between Solana and Ethereum.In other words, it is not just another scaling tool. It has the potential to bridge major blockchain ecosystems, unlocking opportunities in NFTs , gaming, and DeFi.Solaxy’s growing popularity indicates that investors are ready to back innovative projects despite the bearish market. Influential crypto voices like Austin Hilton have taken notice of the project, highlighting its core features.Even as the broader market struggles, Solaxy is gaining strong momentum.Solaxy is currently priced at just $0.001648, while Solana is selling for $130. The price difference presents a significant upside for early investors.While Solana has a $65 billion market cap, Solaxy’s starting valuation leaves substantial room for potential growth. The presale price is a major attraction for early investors.The incentives don’t stop there. Early adopters can benefit from Solaxy’s passive rewards program. It allows investors to earn by locking their tokens. Solaxy’s current annual percentage yield (APY) stands at around 150%, presenting an opportunity for investors seeking long-term gains. More than 6.5 billion tokens have been locked into the protocol so far. With 25% of the supply set aside for community rewards, the team shows commitment to stability. The strategy could reduce early-stage sell-offs and lay a robust path for growth.Security is another factor working in Solaxy’s favour.

"How to deal with Trump: Flattery, retaliation, or holding out?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/how-to-deal-with-trump-flattery-retaliation-or-holding-out/articleshow/119121261.cms,"Trump has consistently portrayed himself as an excellent dealmaker.

Why it matters

Trump’s America First approach is forcing allies to rethink their economic and military dependencies. Countries that once assumed Washington was a reliable partner are now questioning whether Trump’s transactional style leaves them vulnerable.

Economic risks: Retaliatory tariffs could escalate into a full-scale trade war, disrupting supply chains and rattling financial markets.

Retaliatory tariffs could escalate into a full-scale trade war, disrupting supply chains and rattling financial markets. Diplomatic d ilemmas: Nations must decide whether to challenge Trump’s rhetoric publicly or attempt to negotiate exemptions quietly.

Nations must decide whether to challenge Trump’s rhetoric publicly or attempt to negotiate exemptions quietly. Security concerns: Trump’s threats to Nato and his unpredictable foreign policy approach have left many allies, particularly in Europe, rethinking their military strategies.

The big picture

1. Canada’s aggressive retaliation

When Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada struck back with tariffs on US goods and a fee hike on electricity exports to the US.

imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum, Canada struck back with tariffs on US goods and a fee hike on electricity exports to the US. Trump responded with threats to double Canada’s tariffs, sparking a fiery exchange with Ontario Premier Doug Ford . Both sides eventually walked back their actions, but tensions remain high.

. Both sides eventually walked back their actions, but tensions remain high. The risk? The confrontation led to economic instability, with Canadian markets reacting negatively to the trade war, the Politico report said.

2. Mexico’s quiet diplomacy

Unlike Canada, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has avoided retaliatory measures and has instead sought behind-the-scenes negotiations.

Sheinbaum has held off on retaliating against Trump’s fentanyl-related tariffs and the new steel and aluminum tariffs, hoping to negotiate exemptions.

The risk? Mexico’s passive approach has yet to yield major wins, and Trump’s administration still sees Mexico as an easy target, the Politico report added.

3. Europe’s coordinated response

The EU is retaliating in phases, announcing a two-stage tariff plan targeting $28 billion in US goods, set to begin on April 1.

Trump falsely claimed on Truth Social that the EU had already implemented a 50% tariff on whiskey, vowing to hit French wines and champagnes with a 200% tariff in response.

The risk? A full-scale trade war between the EU and the US could disrupt global markets and deepen the economic divide between Western allies.

4. China’s strategic patience?

Unlike other countries, China’s rhetoric has been high but response has been measured, allowing space for negotiations.

Beijing is believed to be pursuing a new trade deal, similar to the 2020 agreement during Trump’s first term.

The risk? A full-blown US-China trade war would really hit the world economy hard.

5. The UK and Japan’s cautious approach

The UK has refused to retaliate, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer sending trade officials to Washington to negotiate exemptions.

Japan and Australia are following a similar path, opting for quiet diplomacy instead of direct confrontation.

The risk? While this approach may prevent economic escalation, it also allows Trump to set the terms of the trade dispute unchallenged.

6. India: A different approach

India’s approach reflects a strategic blend of diplomacy, economic pragmatism, and a focus on safeguarding its domestic interests. Recent moves like slashing motorcycle tariffs and dropping retaliatory duties on US agricultural goods in 2023 signal India’s willingness to make concessions to de-escalate tensions.

At the same time, India is engaged in active bilateral negotiations, aiming to finalize a mutually beneficial trade agreement.

What they are saying

William Reinsch, former US commerce official, told Politico: “Is it better to grovel and kiss the ring or stand up to the bully? Both have worked on occasion and both have failed. So it’s hard to know in any given circumstance which one is the better tactic.”

EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic: “There’s still time for the US to settle this without unnecessary pain.”

Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick: “Europe and Canada do not respect Trump or America’s ability to build its steel and aluminum industry.”

Mexico’s former US ambassador, Arturo Sarukhán: “More aggressive responses, like Canada’s and the EU’s, could backfire.”

Between the lines

Not only tariffs, Trump’s Nato stance is also alarming US allies. His remark that he would “encourage” Russia to attack Nato members who fail to meet defense spending targets has left European nations deeply concerned.

Meanwhile, Canada is pivoting towards Europe. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first foreign visit was to France and the UK, signaling a shift away from dependence on the US.

Germany is increasing defense spending to counter Trump’s unpredictability, committing billions to military expansion in response to his Nato skepticism.

Germany has announced historic defense spending, breaking from its post-WWII reluctance.

Some European leaders are considering an independent nuclear deterrent, possibly involving France and the UK.

Canada is reinforcing its Arctic presence, fearing Trump’s annexation rhetoric.

What’s next

April 2 is the next flashpoint. Trump’s reciprocal tariffs will take effect, potentially triggering more retaliatory measures.

Canada and the EU may accelerate new trade alliances to reduce dependence on the US.

Mexico’s wait-and-see strategy could pay off if Trump offers exemptions, but risks looking weak.

Nato members may push for alternative defense structures, anticipating further US disengagement.

As US President Donald Trump imposes tariffs and shakes up long-standing alliances, world leaders are testing different approaches to dealing with his unpredictable style. From Mexico to Canada to China to EU, different nations and leaders have pursued starkly different strategies with mixed results.With a fresh wave of tariffs on steel and aluminum in effect and more reciprocal tariffs looming in April, other nations are watching closely. Should they retaliate forcefully, like Canada and the EU, or opt for quiet diplomacy, like Mexico and the UK? The answer could determine the global economic and security landscape for years to come.According to a Politico report, countries are adopting different tactics to deal with Trump’s aggressive economic policies, each with its own set of risks and rewards:(With inputs from agencies)",Trump’s America First approach is forcing allies to rethink their economic and military dependencies.

"Will Bitcoin price crash to $20,000? Peter Schiff makes big prediction if Nasdaq enters bear market phase",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/will-bitcoin-price-crash-to-20000-peter-schiff-makes-big-prediction-if-nasdaq-enters-bear-market-phase/articleshow/119107096.cms,"Regarding Bitcoin's potential decline, Schiff observed that with the Nasdaq already showing a 12% decrease.

Below is the full text of Peter Schiff’s post on X:

The NASDAQ is down 12%. If this correction turns out to be a bear market, and the correlation where a 12% decline in the NASDAQ equates to a 24% decline in Bitcoin holds, when the NASDAQ is down 20%, Bitcoin will be about $65K.

But if the NASDAQ goes into a bear market, history shows that the decline will be much larger. Following the bursting of the Dot-com bubble, it fell almost 80%. During the 2008 GFC, it fell 55%, and during the COVID crash in 2020, it fell about 30%. The average of those three bear markets is a 55% decline. If this bear market bottoms with just a 40% decline, that would put Bitcoin at about $20K. However, my bet would be that a drop of that magnitude would accelerate Bitcoin's collapse to much lower levels.

On the other hand, the correlation between the NASDAQ and gold has been negative. Since the NASDAQ peaked on Dec. 16th, 2023, gold is up 13%, almost a perfect 1-to-1 correlation. So, if that correlation holds too, a 40% drop in the NASDAQ would put gold over $3,800. However, my guess is that if a bear market in stocks coincides with a significant decline in the dollar on foreign exchange markets, gold will rise much higher.

But even at $3,800 gold and $20K Bitcoin, in terms of gold, Bitcoin will be down over 85%. Given that such a divergence will likely end the pretense that Bitcoin is a store of value similar to gold, there will clearly be no justification for the U.S. government or any state government to keep any Bitcoin in a Strategic Reserve. There will also be no reason for ETF investors to keep holding their positions either. With all that selling, it will be impossible for $MSTR to sell enough Bitcoin to avoid bankruptcy.

NEW DELHI: Uncle Sam expects visitors from India to continue growing at the fastest rate till the end of this decade — as it has seen happen post Covid. The US government's National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) has forecast visitors from India will more than double at 201% from 2019’s 14.7 lakh in 2029, as against an average of 122% for rest of the world with Italy being the second fastest at 131%. Overall, international visitors to America are expected to increase to almost 10 crore in 2029, up from the 2019 figure of 7.9 crore.The US has so far seen visitors from only two countries surpass pre-pandemic levels — India and Italy. “Helped by a strong economy, visitation from India has increased 552% since 2020 to 22 lakh in 2024 and India has become the fourth largest US inbound travel market. This strong growth will continue over the next few years. India visitation is expected to be more than double that of the 2019 level by 2029,” a NTTO document says.Going ahead, the NTTO forecasts India to see the highest growth over 2019 visitors. “For India, one of the fastest growing countries since the pandemic, arrivals to the United States already exceeded the pre-pandemic level by almost 50% in 2024. Although visitation from all Asian countries included in the forecast increased significantly in 2024, China and Japan were still roughly halfway back to their pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, arrivals from South Korea reached three quarters of its 2019 level,” the document says.The NTTO forecast covers the top inbound markets for the US that include Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Italy, UK, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and Brazil. Visitation from these countries accounted for 78% of total US international inbound arrivals in 2024. The US has classified these top markets under three heads: Those which surpassed pre-pandemic levels in 2024 (India and Italy); those that will do so in 2026 (Germany, France, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico) and those that will be fully recovered in 2027 and later (Australia, China, South Korea, UK and Japan).While India-US travel is rouching new highs post Covid, the travel industry says it remains way below potential due to two factors — long visa interview wait times and few direct flights due to US airlines not using Russian airspace. A record number of Indians travelled to the US last calendar year, more than CY 2023’s figure of 17.6 lakh which had overtaken the pre-Covid 2019 high of 14.7 lakh. India is now the second largest overseas source market of international visitors to the US, after the UK.The waiting period for B1/B2 interview is currently 407 days in Chennai; 156 in Delhi; 151 in Mumbai; 140 in Hyderabad and 114 in Kolkata, according to the US state department website.","The US has so far seen visitors from only two countries surpass pre-pandemic levels — India and Italy.

'Shock and awe approach': Raghuram Rajan criticises Trump administration's economic reasoning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/shock-and-awe-approach-raghuram-rajan-criticises-trump-administrations-economic-reasoning/articleshow/119068993.cms,"

Renowned economist Raghuram Rajan challenged the Trump administration ’s economic views, especially on trade deficits and the US dollar’s global influence. He disagreed with economist Stephen Miran’s claims, arguing that America’s trade deficits are due to excessive spending, not foreign demand for US financial assets.Miran, nominated to Trump’s council of economic advisers, suggested that high demand for US Treasuries forces the country to run fiscal deficits, keeping the dollar strong and hurting American exporters.Rajan, however, disagreed, pointing out that the US has had trade deficits since the mid-1970s—long before foreign central banks started holding large dollar reserves after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.He further highlighted that the country does not have an uniform trade deficit, “rather, it has a trade deficit in goods and a net surplus in services (of nearly $300 billion in 2024)”. He pointed out that companies like Apple generate massive profits by designing high-value products while outsourcing manufacturing to countries like China and India.Rajan also questioned Miran’s argument that foreign demand for US Treasuries does not “reflect such a premium, giving the US little benefit from producing high- demand financial assets”, adding, “Why would such demand hold up the dollar but not push down US bond rates?”Instead, Rajan believed that Congress simply spends freely, relying on global investors to fund its deficits. If demand for treasuries were truly excessive, he argued, the US could just “run smaller deficits,” and benefit from even lower borrowing costs.The former RBI governor was also sceptical of Trump’s aggressive stance on global trade.While Miran pointed out, “tariffs will partly be offset by a stronger dollar, as was the case in 2018-19, when the US imposed sweeping tariffs on China,” Rajan warned that such tactics would force foreign central banks to sell US treasuries, making it harder for America to finance its fiscal shortfalls.He acknowledged that global imbalances exist, citing issues like Chinese under-consumption and unfair trade practices by some US partners. However, Rajan also contended that these concerns would be best addressed through negotiations, not economic coercion.Ultimately, Rajan argued that Trump’s policies reflect a broader shift in the US’s attitude towards the global economic system it helped create.While Miran and others portray the dollar’s dominance as a burden, their reluctance to relinquish this ""burden"" suggested otherwise. If Trump’s “shock and awe” approach alienates allies and weakens confidence in the dollar, the former governor warned, the US may one day find itself carrying a real economic burden, one that it made on its own.","Raghuram Rajan challenged the Trump administration ’s economic views, especially on trade deficits and the US dollar’s global influence.

The US economy is facing increasing fears of a slowdown, with stock markets spiralling downward amid growing concerns over President Donald Trump ’s escalating trade war . The Nasdaq Composite has entered correction territory, falling more than 10% from recent highs, while the S&P 500 teeters on the edge of the same level. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also showing signs of a downturn, reflecting heightened uncertainty about the nation’s economic future.The latest data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDP now model paints a grim picture, revising its first-quarter growth forecast from a 2.4% expansion to a 2.8% contraction, spurring fears that a recession could be on the horizon, according to an ET report.While most analysts still view the chances of an immediate recession as moderate, the combination of escalating tariffs, unpredictable fiscal policies, and a hawkish Federal Reserve stance is creating a storm of anxiety across financial markets.A major factor contributing to market volatility is President Trump’s aggressive trade policies. On Tuesday, the US administration imposed a significant increase in tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Canada, raising duties from 25% to 50% in retaliation for Canadian levies on electricity exports to the US Additionally, the administration has enacted a 20% tariff on all Chinese imports, with threats of further duties on goods from Mexico and Europe, deepening concerns among investors.In response to these developments, Wall Street strategists have revised their forecasts. J.P. Morgan’s chief economist has now raised the probability of a US recession to 40%, up from 25% just a month ago. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs has reduced its 2025 US growth forecast from 2.4% to 1.7%, warning that the tariff hikes could shave up to 1% off GDP if other nations retaliate. As businesses scale back on hiring and capital investment, these trade tensions are further dampening economic sentiment.Adding to the uncertainty, President Trump acknowledged the potential for an economic slowdown, stating in a Fox News interview that “there is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big,” but refusing to rule out the possibility of a recession.Hedge fund titan Ray Dalio , founder of Bridgewater Associates, has raised alarm bells over the structural weaknesses in the US economy, particularly the rising national debt. Dalio warned that the country’s ballooning debt burden, now exceeding $36.2 trillion (122% of GDP), could lead to severe economic consequences.“We have a very severe supply-demand problem when it comes to US debt,” Dalio said in a CNBC interview on Wednesday. He noted that the US government would need to sell large amounts of debt, but the world may not have the appetite for it, which could trigger “shocking developments,” including debt restructuring, geopolitical pressure on creditors, or even austerity measures.Dalio’s comments coincide with signals of distress in bond markets, where the yield curve has flattened sharply, often seen as a precursor to an economic downturn. The spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields has widened to its highest level since September 2024, adding to investor concerns about economic instability.The technology sector has borne the brunt of the recent market declines, with the Nasdaq Composite falling nearly 9% in 2025 so far. Wall Street analysts have revised their revenue growth expectations for major tech companies, citing weaker consumer demand, cautious corporate spending, and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding global trade.Indian IT stocks, heavily reliant on US corporate clients, have also suffered. The Nifty IT index has entered bear market territory, with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) seeing a nearly 23% drop in shares, and LTIMindtree losing more than 33% of its market value. Morgan Stanley has downgraded several Indian IT stocks, warning that a potential US recession could significantly reduce demand for outsourced technology services.The Federal Reserve is caught between conflicting pressures. On the one hand, consumer inflation showed signs of easing in February, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising 2.8% annually, slightly below expectations. However, the effects of tariffs on imported goods could drive future price increases, compelling the Fed to keep interest rates elevated for longer.While the Fed has kept rates unchanged in its last two meetings following a 50 basis-point cut in 2024, policymakers have signalled a cautious approach moving forward. Boston Fed President Susan Collins stated that while risks are increasing, it’s still unclear whether a recession is imminent.A prolonged period of high interest rates could place additional strain on an already fragile economic outlook, especially as corporate debt levels continue to climb.Should the US slowdown materialize into a full-blown recession, the global economy could face significant challenges. Emerging markets may experience capital outflows as investors flock to safe-haven assets, while key trading partners such as Europe, China, and India may suffer demand shocks due to declining US imports.For now, investors are closely watching Washington and the Federal Reserve, hoping for clarity on the next steps that could determine whether the US economy simply slows or plunges into a full recession.","The US economy is facing increasing fears of a slowdown, with stock markets spiralling downward. The Nasdaq Composite has entered correction territory, falling more than 10% from recent highs. Wall Street strategists have revised their forecasts. The technology sector has borne the brunt of the recent market declines.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119041978,imgsize-691740,width-400,resizemode-4/119041978.jpg"

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

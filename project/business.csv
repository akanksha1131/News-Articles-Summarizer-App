Gold price prediction today: Is gold set to exhibit a bullish bias in the near term?

Gold price prediction

today:

Gold prices have pulled back from recent highs, but there is an underlying bullish bias, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

Below is his outlook for gold prices today and this week, along with top factors that will influence the movement of the yellow metal:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold is hovering around $5,000 after weaker-than-expected US inflation reinforced expectations of Fed easing, driving the 10-year US Treasury yield lower with market participants to price nearly 50% odds of a third rate cut by December. Inflation data last week was reported 0.1% lower than estimates.Recent comments from Kevin Warsh signaling a preference for lower policy rates add to expectations of two 25bp cuts in March and June, which would further compress real yields and support gold inflows. Geopolitical risks remain elevated, with reports of Washington deploying the USS Gerald R. Ford to the Middle East amid stalled Iran nuclear talks boosting safe-haven demand.Meanwhile, markets are increasingly focused on the potential inflationary impact of renewed tariff threats from Trump, alongside lingering questions over Fed credibility.Notably, gold is trading at a discount for the first time in nearly a month even as Chinese demand strengthens, with Shanghai warehouse stocks crossing 100 tonnes, highlighting robust physical buying interest.Focus this week will be on FOMC meeting minutes, PCE price index. The US market remains shut amidst the President's day holiday while China’s market remains shut for the week amidst lunar new year.Technically, MCX Gold on the daily chart continues to maintain a broader bullish bias despite the recent pullback, with price holding well above the key medium-term support zone near 148,000–150,000, which coincides with the 20-day moving average and prior breakout levels. Immediate resistance is seen around 158,000–160,000, where recent highs and upper supply zones are clustered; a sustained close above this band could open the path toward fresh highs.Fibonacci retracement levels suggest strong structural support near the 0.382 and 0.5 zones around 139,000–134,000 on a deeper correction, keeping the broader uptrend intact unless these levels are decisively breached. Volume patterns indicate that the sharp spike seen during the recent sell-off was not followed by sustained heavy distribution, suggesting profit booking rather than trend reversal.From a Bollinger Band perspective, price recently touched the upper band during the rally and has since cooled toward the middle band (20-SMA), indicating volatility compression and potential base formation; if price stabilizes above the mid-band and bands begin to expand again, it would favor a continuation move higher, whereas a decisive break below the middle band could trigger short-term corrective pressure toward lower supports.","Gold prices have pulled back from recent highs, but there is an underlying bullish bias, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

Experts are of the view that the indices may continue to move in a narrow range with a slight upward bias, as investors await cues technology stocks and AI related developments.Analysts indicated that attention will be on Infosys’ AI-focused investor meet and the ongoing India AI Impact Summit, both of which are expected to influence sentiment in technology counters and potentially guide near-term market direction.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “Despite the sell-off in capital market-related stocks due to RBI’s tighter rules on loans to proprietary traders and brokers, Nifty jumped 211 points yesterday. This is a reflection of the underlying resilience of the market. This resilience primarily stems from India’s improving macros and its implications for corporate earnings, going forward.The 14.7% growth in corporate earnings reflected in the Q3 results has come better-than-expected and the momentum is set to continue in Q4, accelerating in FY 27.”“FIIs cannot ignore this positive development and, therefore, will turn significant buyers in India, despite the occasional selling in response to events like the AI shock impacting IT stocks. The market will respond to geopolitical developments like the US-Iran stand off. Corrections can be used as buying opportunities. The impressive credit growth happening now has positive implications for leading banking stocks which are fairly valued.

Kwality Wall's eyes bigger scoop of ice cream market after HUL demerger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/kwality-walls-eyes-bigger-scoop-of-ice-cream-market-after-hul-demerger/articleshow/128442321.cms,"Kwality Wall's

MUMBAI: Kwality Wall's India, which brought Magnum and Cornetto ice-creams to local households, is looking to expand in a market where there's enough and more room to push ice-creams as an everyday snacking product.Ice cream consumption is getting a boost due to factors like rise of quick-commerce, increasing penetration of refrigerators in Indian homes, and electrification that is enabling small kiranas to install freezers and broaden access. Kwality Wall's India (KWIL) wants to ride on the tailwinds to bolster its reach following its demerger from parent HUL and listing on the bourses, executives said.On Monday, KWIL listed at Rs 29.90 on the BSE, a near 22% discount to its adjusted price of Rs 38. ""Short-term price volatility will always exist but we need to ensure we grow competitively. Ice-cream as a category is already at an inflection point. We will see a lot of growth come in. This demerger gives us the independence to have an end-to-end focus,"" said deputy MD Chitrank Goel in an interview.As part of the demerger, The Magnum Ice Cream Company, based in Netherlands, is acquiring 61.9% stake in KWIL from Unilever.On Monday, it also made an open offer to buy another 26% in KWIL, which once completed, will make The Magnum Ice Cream Company the single largest shareholder (and new parent) of KWIL. The stock price of KWIL settled at Rs 29.51 apiece on the BSE, a discount of 22.6% to the adjusted price.The eight-decade-old company, originally known as Kwality, was acquired by HUL in 1994. As KWIL bets on quick commerce, largely used by premium households, it will face competition from new-age brands such as Go Zero and Noto are coming up with healthier, low calorie variants.","Kwality Wall's India (KWIL) wants to ride on the tailwinds to bolster its reach following its demerger from parent HUL.

India’s exports to US drop 22% due to Trump’s 50% tariffs; overall trade data suggests signs of resilient market diversification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-exports-to-us-drop-22-due-to-trumps-50-tariffs-overall-trade-data-suggests-signs-of-resilient-market-diversification/articleshow/128429703.cms,"India’s exports to the US also fell by 21.77% to $6.6 billion in January, largely due to the 50% tariffs imposed by the Donald Trump administration.

Trump tariffs hit India’s exports to US

India’s Diversifying Exports Basket

India’s merchandise exports grew marginally in January to $36.56 billion, up 0.61%. On the other hand, imports rose sharply by 19.2% to $71.24 billion, compared to $59.77 billion in the same period last year. As a result, the country’s trade deficit widened to $34.68 billion in January.Exports continued to remain on an upward trajectory in both goods and services segments. According to Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal, the total exports of goods and services are expected to cross $860 billion during the current financial year.For the April to January period, exports increased by 2.22% to $366.63 billion.India’s exports to the US also fell by 21.77% to $6.6 billion in January, largely due to the 50% tariffs imposed by the Donald Trump administration.The US imposed a broad 50% tariff on Indian goods entering its market from August 27. The two countries have since concluded an interim trade arrangement under which the US removed 25% penal tariffs on Indian products from February 7, while reciprocal tariffs are set to be reduced to 18% from 25%. India’s exports are now competitively placed among regional peers.Exports had also contracted in September, October and December last year, although shipments had seen a growth of 22.61% in November.Imports from the United States, meanwhile, increased by 23.71% to $4.5 billion in January, the data showed.During the April to January period of the current financial year, India’s exports to the US rose by 5.85% to $72.46 billion, while imports grew by 13.87% to $43.92 billion.Exports to China surged by 55.65% to $1.63 billion during January, while imports from China rose 16.67% to $12.23 billion. For the April-January period of the fiscal year, exports to China increased by 38.37% to $15.88 billion, whereas imports expanded by 13.82% to $108.18 billion.India’s exports to countries including the UAE, Netherlands, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Italy, Hong Kong, Spain, Belgium, Malaysia and Vietnam recorded positive growth during the month under review. In contrast, shipments to the UK, Bangladesh, Singapore, Australia, France and Brazil declined.On the import side, inflows fell from countries such as Russia, Iraq, Korea, Germany, Thailand and Australia, while imports increased from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia. India primarily imports gold from Switzerland, and purchases from the country jumped sharply by 836.85% in January to $3.95 billion.According to the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), the latest trade figures for January 2026 reflect the significant impact of US tariffs on India’s export performance, while also indicating early signs of diversification into other markets.“Shipments to the United States followed a clear three-phase pattern between April 2025 and January 2026. After a brief uptick in May, exports fell steadily from $8.3 billion in June to $5.5 billion in September as tariff pressures intensified. A short-lived recovery followed, with exports rising to $6.3 billion in October and $7.0 billion in November, but the rebound faded when hopes of a quick trade deal did not materialise. Exports slipped again to $6.9 billion in December and $6.6 billion in January. With Washington expected to cut reciprocal tariffs on most Indian goods from 50% to 18% this week, we anticipate a swift recovery in shipments,” said GTRI in a note.The broader data suggest that the slowdown is largely concentrated in shipments to the US rather than reflecting a global decline.“Exports to the rest of the world remained resilient, edging up from $29.9 billion to $30.0 billion (+0.3%). The figures suggest that tariff barriers in the US market have driven India’s recent export slowdown, even as exporters begin cautiously expanding beyond their largest single market,” GTRI added.","India’s merchandise exports grew marginally in January to $36.56 billion, up 0.61%.

MUMBAI: Strong buying in a host of bank stocks and Reliance Industries lifted the Sensex by 650 points on Monday to close at 83,277 points.

The session also saw a host of stock of companies that have their businesses closely linked to the stock exchange slide on the back of RBI's recent rule changes that made it stricter for banks to lend for stock-related usage.

Cash in circulation rises 11% to record Rs 40 lakh crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cash-in-circulation-rises-11-to-record-rs-40-lakh-crore/articleshow/128442587.cms,"Representational image

MUMBAI: Currency in circulation (CiC) touched a record Rs 40 lakh crore in Jan, rising 11.1% year-on-year, even as its share in the economy declined. The cash-to-GDP ratio eased to around 11.2%, down sharply from the pandemic peak of 14.4% in March 2021, signalling digital payments are financing a growing share of economic activity despite higher absolute cash holdings.In absolute terms, currency holdings have expanded steadily over the past decade. CiC rose from Rs 11.8 lakh crore in March 2013 (12% of GDP) to Rs 16.6 lakh crore in March 2016. Following demonetisation, it fell to Rs 13.4 lakh crore in March 2017 but surged to Rs 28.5 lakh crore in the pandemic-era dash-to-cash by March 2021 (14.4%). While the absolute amount of cash continued to rise, the CiC-GDP ratio moderated to 13.7% in March 2022, 12.4% in March 2023, 11.9% in March 2024 and 11.26% in March 2025, before stabilising around 11-11.2% by Jan 2026.A report by State Bank of India attributed the record cash stock to tax enforcement, low interest rates and shifting household behaviour. Around 18,000 GST notices issued in July 2025 to small vendors based on UPI transaction volumes coincided with spikes in ATM withdrawals in Karnataka, West Bengal and Kerala, indicating a shift back to cash among small traders. Weak deposit growth and lower interest rates have also encouraged precautionary cash savings, while households selling gold and silver to raise liquidity have supported cash holdings and consumption.Digital payments, however, continue to expand rapidly. Data from National Payments Corporation of India show UPI now accounts for about 70-80% of digital payments. Monthly UPI transactions rose from around 140 crore in March 2020 to over 200 crore by Oct 2020 and 355 crore by Aug 2021, valued at Rs 6.4 lakh crore. Record levels were reached in Dec 2025 with 2,163 crore transactions worth nearly Rs 28 lakh crore, followed by 2,170 crore transactions in Jan 2026 - roughly 70 crore transactions a day.Currency denomination trends reinforce the store-of-value role of cash. The Rs 500 note's share in total currency value rose by 4.4% between April 2025 and Jan 2026. After the withdrawal of the Rs 2,000 note, medium denominations gained ground. Small-value notes continued to lose relevance, with the volume share of notes below Rs 20 declining from 36.5% in 2023 to 32.4% in 2025 and their value share edging down from 1.7% to 1.6%.The broad trend suggests a structural shift: more cash is being held in absolute terms, but a declining cash-to-GDP ratio alongside rapid UPI adoption indicates physical currency is increasingly retained for storage, while digital systems handle a rising share of everyday transactions.","CiC touched a record Rs 40 lakh crore in Jan, rising 11.1% year-on-year.

Quantities in line with imports

NEW DELHI: As an Indian team heads to Washington to finalise the legal text for the interim trade agreement, which is sought to be signed by March, officials on Monday said that govt had offered quotas in most agricultural goods, where duty is sought to be reduced as part of the deal with the US.They said that in most cases, the quantities offered are small and inputs, such as cotton that are already being imported, will be allowed in a way that they feed into the requirements of the Indian textiles industry, which can step up exports after the finalisation of trade agreements with the European Union and the UK. The officials said quotas for agricultural products, which have been offered in other trade agreements too, are in line with current imports.""We have looked at our requirements. Besides, we are a net exporter of agricultural products. The deals will help us increase export of farm goods and open a $400 billion opportunity in the EU and the US,"" the official said.India's agricultural exports to the US are pegged at $2.8 billion, while imports are around $1.5 billion. India's imports of farm goods add up to around $35 billion, while exports are valued at over $50 billion, the official argued.The comments come amid attacks from Opposition parties, which have accused govt of offering significant concessions to the US. Govt has argued that it has protected its sensitivity in farm and dairy.Officials also said the agreement will be on the lines spelt out in the joint statement and there had been discussion around digital service tax and e-commerce with the US, although they may be taken up when a full bilateral trade agreement is negotiated. They said that the details will be known once the agreement is signed.Commerce secretary Rajesh Agrawal said that India's chief negotiator Darpan Jain will be visiting the US to finalise the legal text. ""The joint statement lays down the contours of the deal. Now, this has to be translated into a legal agreement, which will be signed between the two sides,"" he said. Agrawal, who was earlier India's chief negotiator, indicated that the US will lower the reciprocal tariff from 25% to 18% this week.","Indian team heads to Washington to finalise the legal text for the interim trade agreement, which is sought to be signed by March.

ET

NEW DELHI: The government is reviewing Press Note 3 and may introduce a ‘de minimis’ threshold to allow automatic approvals for small foreign investments, sourcessaid.Press Note 3, issued in April 2020 to curb opportunistic takeovers of Indian firms during the pandemic, made prior government approval mandatory for foreign direct investment (FDI) from bordering countries — with China being the primary focus.Under the proposed change, investments below a certain size could qualify for automatic clearance rather than the current case‑by‑case approval process, according to ET.Officials said the move is aimed at reducing compliance burdens and speeding up small‑ticket investments, especially in sectors where funding is urgently needed but sensitive technologies are not involved.“We are examining whether there could be any openings to make it faster and easier to get a yes or a no on investments into India,” a top government official told. “We are also examining whether we could have any de minimis to permit larger funds that have some small element which has come to our attention.”The threshold would likely be defined by either a percentage stake or monetary value, and the final decision will be taken after weighing security concerns.Under the current framework, any FDI from entities based in or beneficially owned by citizens of bordering countries must be routed through the government approval process irrespective of investment size. Investment proposals are examined by the ministries of home and external affairs, and adverse reports — including those related to links with the Chinese Communist Party or the People’s Liberation Army — often hold up proposals.“Press Note 3 won’t be rescinded in any event,” the official said. “We have a cautious approach about the nature of investments that come into the country as we want to ensure there are no opportunistic takeovers of our critical sectors. And, therefore, Press Note 3 will continue.”Industry executives have said the mandatory approval route has led to delays even in small stake purchases or follow‑on investments in already‑approved ventures.The review of Press Note 3 comes amid geopolitical shifts, with ties between India and China easing since last year through ministerial visits, agreements to resume direct flights and allow tourists, and increased dialogue on resolving border disputes.The Centre has also said it has been accommodative on visas. “In order to support the Make in India initiative, the government authorises the issue of business visas to foreign nationals, including to Chinese nationals (specialists/engineers/technical people), being engaged by Indian companies,” the external affairs ministry told Parliament last week. “Government of India has generally followed a facilitative approach towards business and employment visas, within the bounds of the relevant rules and policy. ”","Press Note 3 was issued in April 2020 to curb opportunistic takeovers of Indian firms during the pandemic.

Union Budget 2026: Government’s sankalp to build a Healthy India and shape a Viksit Bharat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/union-budget-2026-governments-sankalp-to-build-a-healthy-india-and-shape-a-viksit-bharat/articleshow/128431447.cms,"By Bhanu Prakash Kalmath SJ

Budget 2026 Sets Long-Term Direction For India’s Economic Growth: Kidwai

(Bhanu Prakash Kalmath SJ is Partner and Healthcare Industry Leader, Grant Thornton Bharat)

Union Budget 2026 signals a decisive pivot in India’s health policy to build the full stack required for an innovation-led, patient-centred health economy. The government’s priorities are visible in three simultaneous moves: elevating India from a generics-first market to a credible biologics and biosimilars hub; scaling clinical trials and regulatory infrastructure to global standards; and strengthening preventive care and service delivery in areas where the system remains thin—mental health, emergency and trauma care, allied health manpower for Viksit Bharat, and integrative care that can anchor medical value tourism. Put simply, this is a capability-building budget: it lays the rails for discovering, testing, approving, and delivering advanced therapies at scale.This direction closely aligns with what the Economic Survey 2025–26 has flagged about the double burden of increasing Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and communicable diseases (CDs) though the CDs are declining. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancers now account for over 57 per cent of all deaths, while overweight and obesity affect 24 per cent of women and 23 per cent of men - clear markers of lifestyle-driven risk accumulating across the working-age population.The Budget also reinforces the need to shift the health system from being largely treatment-led to one that prioritises prevention, early intervention, and behavioural health, reflecting growing concern around rising digital addiction and its mental-health implications highlighted in the Survey.The headline announcement, Biopharma SHAKTI, with an outlay of ₹10,000 crore over five years, aims to enhance domestic manufacturing capability in the emerging biopharma market requiring significant capital- and talent investments. It seeks to move India up the pharmaceutical value chain, from volume-driven generics to complex therapies. The proposed expansion and upgrading of NIPERs, creation of over 1,000 accredited clinical trial sites, and strengthening of the CDSCO through specialised scientific cadres together address long-standing bottlenecks in skills, trials, and regulatory timelines. Long-awaited reforms in the clinical trials ecosystem are a welcome move and could further attract global pharma Global Capability Centres (GCC) to India who are moving up the value chain to be an integral part of the R&D.Affordability and ease of living receive immediate attention as well. Exempting basic customs duty on 17 cancer drugs and extending duty-free personal imports to seven additional rare diseases provide near-term relief from out-of-pocket costs while domestic biopharma capacity scales up, an important intervention given that one in nine Indians faces a lifetime risk of cancer.On the service delivery side, the establishment of NIMHANS-2 in North India, upgrades of mental health institutes in Ranchi and Tezpur to regional apex centres, and a 50 per cent expansion of emergency and trauma care capacity across district hospitals directly address geographic inequities in mental health access and the catastrophic expenditures that medical emergencies often trigger. These choices emphasise behavioural health pressures, including anxiety and depression linked to excessive screen time, now increasingly visible among younger cohorts.Manpower- critical to both care delivery and prevention- is another binding constraint the Budget seeks to ease. Upgrading allied health institutions, adding 100,000 Allied Health Professionals across ten disciplines, and training 1.5 lakh caregivers in areas such as geriatric care, wellness, yoga, and assistive technologies will provide the operating muscle hospitals and home-care ecosystems need to translate infrastructure investments into improved throughput and quality.The Budget also reinforces India’s integrative and export-oriented healthcare vision. Proposals to establish five Regional Medical Hubs and strengthen AYUSH- including three new All India Institutes of Ayurveda, upgraded pharmacies and drug-testing laboratories, and an enhanced WHO Global Traditional Medicine Centre- aim to meet growing global demand while supporting farmers, skilled youth, and evidence-based traditional medicine. Importantly, this positions AYUSH not only as a cultural asset but also as a preventive and wellness pillar within the broader health system.Where does this leave the industry, and what will India gain if execution matches intent? In the near term, patients should see lower landed prices for select oncology and rare-disease therapies, hospitals should gain staffing depth that improves operating performance, and more clinical trials should begin and conclude in India with clearer and more predictable regulatory reviews. Over the medium term, domestic biopharma can move up the value chain, medical hubs can translate into sustained medical tourism revenues, and strengthened mental-health and emergency networks can begin to reduce avoidable mortality and catastrophic health spending.As India builds #HealthyIndia to shape a #Vibrant Bharat, further increasing the budget on public health expenditure as a share of GDP and greater support to encourage Research & Development in India would naturally strengthen the framework laid out in this Budget, particularly as the country seeks to deepen innovation and preventive care. Many themes - such as reducing the cost of cancer care, expanding mental-health and emergency infrastructure, strengthening the health workforce, and advancing the ‘Heal in India’ vision to grow medical tourism- also reflect continuity with previous budgets.Overall, Budget 2026 represents a systems-level push. By combining manufacturing, prevention, workforce development, affordability, and integrative care, it moves India closer to becoming a high value products producer at low cost and also a credible hub for prevention, innovation, and advanced healthcare delivery - an essential foundation for a healthier, more resilient, and Viksit Bharat.”","Union Budget 2026 signals a decisive pivot in India’s health policy.

Hair transplant costs in Turkey 2026: A transparent breakdown (no hidden fees),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hair-transplant-costs-in-turkey-2026-a-transparent-breakdown-no-hidden-fees/articleshow/128420641.cms,"Why Turkey is one of the leading destinations for hair transplant



Understanding the different hair transplant methods

FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction): In this method, single hair roots are taken from the back or sides of the head and moved to the areas where hair is thin or missing. FUE is popular because it leaves very small scars and gives a natural look. The cost of FUE in Turkey is usually between $1,500 and $4,000, depending on the number of hair roots required.



DHI (Direct Hair Implantation): A newer method in which hair roots are inserted directly into the scalp using a special pen-shaped tool. This way is more exact and helps more hair roots survive. Because DHI is more detailed, it usually costs more than FUE. In Turkey, DHI usually costs between $2,000 and $5,500.



Factors that influence hair transplant costs in Turkey

Number of grafts: One of the most significant factors that influences the cost is the number of hair follicles (grafts) that need to be transplanted. Generally, the more grafts required, the higher the cost. For example, if you need a large number of grafts for extensive hair restoration, the price will increase accordingly.



Clinic reputation and surgeon experience: The clinic's name and the doctor's experience also affect the price. Top clinics with famous and skilled doctors may charge more. Still, this can be worth it because experienced doctors are more likely to deliver natural-looking results and fewer complications.



Location: The clinic's location in Turkey can also affect the price. Istanbul, which is the main city for medical visitors, usually has higher prices than smaller cities. Still, the price difference is usually small, and you can get great care anywhere in the country.



All-inclusive packages: Many clinics in Turkey offer packages for international clients that include everything. These packages usually cover the surgery, travel, hotel, and post-surgery care. Even if the price looks higher, these packages often give you more for your money because they include extra services that make things easier.



Why transparency in pricing is crucial

Hair loss is a concern for many individuals, and as hair restoration technology advances, more people are opting for hair transplant surgeries to regain their confidence. One of the most sought-after destinations for these procedures is Turkey, which has become a global leader in hair transplants. But while hair transplant in Turkey offers high-quality services at an affordable price, it’s essential for patients to understand the cost breakdown.Before looking at the costs, it’s important to know why hair transplants in Turkey are so popular. Turkey is known for being affordable, having skilled doctors, and using the latest technology.Hair transplants in Turkey cost a fraction of what they would in other countries, such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Despite this significant price difference, Turkey offers the same high standards of care and expertise, making it the go-to choice for individuals seeking hair restoration procedures.The cost of a hair transplant in Turkey changes based on a few things, like which method is used, how much hair you have lost, and which clinic you pick. The two most common methods for hair transplantation are Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) and Direct Hair Implantation (DHI). These methods differ in how they are performed and in cost.The price difference between FUE and DHI mostly depends on how skilled the doctor is, what kind of equipment the clinic uses, and how much hair you have lost. Sometimes, DHI costs more because it needs more careful work.While the chosen method plays a significant role in determining cost, other factors also contribute to the overall price of a hair transplant in Turkey. Here’s a breakdown of what you should expect:When choosing a hair transplant in Turkey, clear pricing is very important. Many people from other countries worry about hidden fees or surprise costs. The best clinics in Turkey ensure they provide clear pricing so patients know exactly what to expect before surgery.Good clinics will give you a clear list of all costs, including extras like travel, hotel, and post-surgery care. If a clinic offers a package that includes everything, make sure the price covers the first visit, the surgery, and post-surgery care.You should also be careful with clinics that have very low prices. Even though Turkey is affordable, prices much lower than normal might indicate poor service or doctors with little experience. Always choose quality and skill over just a low price to get the best results.When thinking about a hair transplant in Turkey, Dr. Serkan Aygin’s clinic is one of the best choices for people from other countries. Dr. Aygin is a well-known expert in hair restoration, known for his meticulous work, personal attention, and outstanding results. His clinic offers various hair transplant methods, including FUE and DHI, and uses the latest technology to ensure patients receive the best care.Dr. Aygin’s clinic also promises clear prices, giving you all the information about costs with no hidden fees. With many successful surgeries and thousands of happy patients, Dr. Serkan Aygin’s clinic is a trusted choice for anyone wanting a hair transplant in Turkey.With transparent pricing, skilled doctors, and the latest technology, Turkey continues to attract people from all over the world for medical care. If you want exceptional results, Dr. Serkan Aygin’s clinic gives top care with no hidden fees, making it a great choice for your hair transplant. Whether you choose FUE or DHI, Dr. Serkan Aygin ensures your treatment fits your needs and delivers natural-looking, long-lasting results.","Hair transplants in Turkey cost a fraction of what they would in other countries, such as the United States or the United Kingdom.

China Buys More Russian Crude As India Steps Back

Even as US President Donald Trump wants the world to stop buying crude oil from Russia, China’s purchases of Russian crude are set to hit a new record in February. China’s procurement of Russian crude is expected to rise for a third consecutive month in February, reaching a fresh record as independent refiners increase buying of heavily discounted cargoes.Shipments of Russian oil to China are projected at about 2.07 million barrels per day for February delivery. This is more than January’s estimated 1.7 million barrels per day, based on preliminary assessments by Vortexa Analytics. Separate provisional figures from Kpler indicate imports of roughly 2.083 million barrels per day in February, compared with 1.718 million barrels per day a month earlier.This comes amidst India reducing its intake, according to traders and vessel-tracking data quoted by Reuters.Data from Kpler shows India’s imports of Russian crude are likely to decline further to around 1.159 million barrels per day in February. The reduced demand has pushed Russian crude prices lower, with cargoes for January and February delivery to China trading at discounts of $9 to $11 per barrel to benchmark ICE Brent.These discounts are among the deepest seen in recent years for the Urals grade, which is shipped from European ports and had typically been directed to India because of shorter shipping distances compared with China.Since November, China has overtaken India as Russia’s largest buyer of seaborne crude. Western sanctions linked to the war in Ukraine, along with pressure on New Delhi to advance a trade agreement with the United States, prompted India to scale back Russian oil purchases to a two-year low in December, the Reuters report said.Also Read | Trump removes 25% penal tariff: What happens if India stops buying Russian crude oil? Supplies of Urals, along with other export grades such as Sokol and Varandey, have added to regular shipments of Russia’s flagship ESPO blend exported from the Far East port of Kozmino, which is geographically closer to China. This has intensified competition with rival crude supplies from Iran.Concerns over potential US military action against Iran have unsettled China’s independent refiners, commonly referred to as teapots, which are among the largest buyers globally of oil subject to US sanctions from Russia, Iran and Venezuela.According to a senior Chinese trader who frequently supplies these refiners, Russian crude has recently gained a competitive edge over Iranian oil in terms of processing quality relative to price. The trader noted that the ESPO blend was last traded at discounts of about $8 to $9 per barrel to ICE Brent for March deliveries, while Iranian Light — a comparable grade — was assessed at roughly $10 to $11 below the same benchmark.Market uncertainty since January regarding the possibility of US strikes on Iran, in the event that nuclear negotiations fail to meet Washington’s expectations, has made Chinese teapots and traders more cautious about purchasing Iranian cargoes, said Emma Li, China analyst at Vortexa.She explained that concerns over potential disruptions to Iranian oil loadings in the event of military tensions have made Russian supplies appear more dependable to buyers. Li also indicated that part of the recent increase in Russian crude purchases has come from larger independent refiners located outside Shandong, the main hub for teapot refiners.Vortexa estimated that Iranian oil shipments to China, often labelled as Malaysian by traders to bypass US sanctions, declined to around 1.03 million barrels per day this month, compared with approximately 1.25 million barrels per day in January.","China’s procurement of Russian crude is expected to rise for a third consecutive month in February.

Asian markets showed little movement on Monday as several trading floors closed for Lunar New Year celebrations. Japan's disappointing economic growth of just 0.1 per cent in late 2025 added pressure on newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Meanwhile, US markets will stay shut for Presidents' Day, and gold prices dipped slightly after reaching $5,000 per ounce.The holiday closures affected mainland China, Seoul, and Taipei, while Hong Kong and Singapore operated only half-day sessions. The slow trading day followed a tech sector decline last week, triggered by worries about massive AI infrastructure investments.Japan's weak GDP numbers fell short of the expected 0.4% growth, creating challenges for Takaichi, who won recent elections promising economic improvement.""The weak growth implies that the large supplementary budget passed at the end of November provided no boost to public spending last quarter just yet,"" said Marcel Thieliant at Capital Economics. He suggested Takaichi might need to act quickly on tax reforms and new budgets.Most Asian markets saw minor losses. Tokyo dropped 0.03%, while Hong Kong managed a 0.4% gain. The market mood improved after US inflation data showed a bigger-than-expected cooling in January.The AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, featuring tech leaders like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Google's Sundar Pichai, starts Monday. The event comes amid growing concerns about AI's social and environmental impacts, despite its role in boosting tech company profits.""US inflation data was good.

Bank operations on Presidents Day

What else is closed

The United States is observing Presidents Day on Monday, Feb. 16, a federal holiday honouring the country’s presidents, especially George Washington. As Americans mark the occasion, one of the common question is what services, like Banking, etc. , remain open and what's shutdown.Since Presidents Day is one of the official federal holidays in the US, several essential services, including government offices and financial institutions, suspend regular operations. Customers planning in-person banking or financial transactions may face closures and delays.Bank branches across the US will remain closed, as financial institutions observe the federal holiday. Major banks such as Capital One, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PNC, Chase, Truist and Citibank will not operate their physical branches on Monday.However, customers can continue using digital banking services.

'Harsh Lesson': Iran Threatens U.S. Of Deadly Retaliation If Islamic Republic Is Attacked

Global oil prices remained steady on Monday as markets closely watch upcoming talks between United States and Iran. While concerns over potential disruptions in oil supply due to US-Iran tensions kept prices stable, OPEC+ is considering increasing production from April. The day saw Brent crude futures slightly down at $67.72 per barrel, while US WTI crude stood at $62.86.The market's cautious stance comes ahead of crucial negotiations between Washington and Tehran in Geneva on Tuesday. These talks aim to resolve their long-running dispute over Iran's nuclear program. Both benchmarks had declined last week after US President Donald Trump suggested a possible deal with Iran within a month.An Iranian diplomat revealed that Iran seeks a nuclear agreement offering mutual economic benefits, including investments in energy and mining sectors, along with aircraft purchases. However, market analyst Tony Sycamore said, ""With both sides expected to hold firm on their core red lines, expectations are low that a deal can be reached and this is likely to be the calm before the storm,"" as quoted by Reuters.Military tensions have escalated, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the region.However, Iran's Revolutionary Guards have threatened to retaliate against US military bases if their territory is attacked.Meanwhile, OPEC+ is considering resuming oil production increases after a three-month pause to meet summer demand. ""The market reacted reasonably well to those reports,"" Sycamore commented, adding ""If that geopolitical premium or support wasn't there, crude oil would likely be trading sub $60 this morning.""Trading activity is expected to be quiet on Monday with several Asian markets, including China, South Korea, and Taiwan, closed for holidays.","Brent crude futures slightly down at $67.72 per barrel, while US WTI crude stood at $62.86.

China Defies UN Sanctions, Helps Iran Rearm After War With Israel, Says Report

US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House on Wednesday to reportedly discuss plans for reducing Iran's oil sales to China, which currently handles over 80 per cent of Iran's oil exports. The agreement comes amid ongoing nuclear talks between US and Iranian officials through Omani mediators.A senior US official told Axios, ""We agreed that we will go full force with maximum pressure against Iran, for example, regarding Iranian oil sales to China,"" as reported by Reuters. This move could significantly impact Iran's oil revenue.The diplomatic efforts coincide with the US positioning a naval fleet in the region. The American military is said to be preparing for potential extended operations against Iran that could last several weeks, according to various media reports.China's response to these developments remains unknown, as no official statement has been given amid the Lunar New Year holiday.In a separate development around US-Iran relations, exiled son of Iran’s last shah Reza Pahlavi, on Saturday called on US President Donald Trump to help the Iranian people, saying it was “time to end the Islamic republic.”Speakingat the Munich Security Conference, Pahlavi said, “It is time to end the Islamic republic.”“This is the demand echoing from the bloodshed of my compatriots who are not asking us to fix the regime but to help them bury it,” he added, as quoted by AFP.Reza Pahlavi directly appealed to Donald Trump, telling reporters, “The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them.”Earlier, Trump had said on Friday that a change of government in Iran would be “the best thing that could happen,” as a second aircraft carrier was deployed to the Middle East to intensify military pressure on the Islamic republic. He had earlier warned of possible military action in support of nationwide protests that peaked in January and were followed by a harsh crackdown that rights groups say left thousands dead.","US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House on Wednesday.

China will remove tariffs on imports from almost all African countries starting May 1, Chinese President Xi Jinping said, according to state media, in a move expected to deepen trade and economic engagement between Beijing and the continent, AFP reported.China already operates a zero-tariff policy for imports from 33 African countries, but Beijing had announced last year that it would expand the policy to all 53 African countries with which it has diplomatic relations.Under the expanded framework, zero levies will apply to all African nations except Eswatini, which maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan. China claims the democratic island as its own and has not ruled out the use of force to assert control over it.China remains Africa’s largest trading partner and has played a major role in infrastructure development across the continent through its Belt and Road Initiative.The move comes at a time when several African countries are diversifying trade relationships, particularly after US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs globally last year.Xi said the zero-tariff arrangement “will undoubtedly provide new opportunities for African development”, while announcing the timeline as leaders across Africa gathered in Ethiopia for the annual African Union summit.The expansion of tariff-free access is expected to strengthen China’s economic influence in Africa while boosting trade flows and market access for African exporters.","China will remove tariffs on imports from almost all African countries starting May 1.

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence

The economy of Pakistan is in a risky state due to its over-reliance on short-term foreign loans, according to business leaders and economists. Key figures are calling for urgent negotiations with friendly nations to extend loan repayment periods and implement structural reforms, as reported by Express Tribune.Vice chairman of the Pakistan industrial and traders associations front (PIAF) Raja Waseem Hassan warned that without extending loan maturities, the country will continue to face balance-of-payments problems. While foreign reserves have grown to $21 billion in January 2026, experts say this improvement relies too heavily on temporary support from international institutions and friendly countries.""The government must immediately begin serious negotiations with friendly nations to secure longer repayment periods and ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves,"" said Hassan. He welcomed recent positive diplomatic developments with Gulf states and the United States but cautioned that these relationships can change quickly.The country's trade performance remains concerning. Exports stood at $32 billion in FY25, while imports continue to exceed export earnings. Dr. Saleem Ahmed, a senior economist, warned that Pakistan can't rely forever on rollovers and short-term deposits. He suggests the country needs 5-6 per cent annual growth to stabilize its debt-to-GDP ratio, which currently hovers around 70 per cent.Economic growth prospects remain modest. The IMF expects 3.6% GDP growth for FY26, while the State Bank of Pakistan projects 3.75-4.75%. Though inflation has dropped from its 38% peak in 2023, strict monetary policies have slowed industrial growth and business lending.Experts recommended focusing on export-oriented sectors like textiles, IT, and agricultural processing. They suggest improving tax collection, reducing energy waste, and boosting remittances, which could reach $42 billion in FY26. They also stress the need to increase foreign direct investment beyond its current annual level of $1.5-2 billion to reduce dependency on external borrowing.Hassan pointedout that while Pakistan's military importance can help in diplomacy, economic strength is crucial for long-term stability. ""Economic strength must be the real shield. Without strong buffers and self-reliance, external partnerships alone cannot guarantee stability,"" he said.","Pakistan's economy is in a risky state due to its over-reliance on short-term foreign loans.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has added several major Chinese companies, including Alibaba and Baidu, to a Pentagon list of firms allegedly supporting China’s military, increasing pressure on Beijing ahead of an expected meeting between leaders of the two countries, according to a Reuters report.The Pentagon’s 1260H list does not directly impose sanctions on the companies. However, under a new US law, the Department of Defense will be barred in the coming years from contracting with or procuring from companies included on the list.Other companies added on Friday include automaker BYD, biotech firm WuXi AppTec and AI-driven robotics company RoboSense Technology Co Ltd. Meanwhile, memory chip maker YMTC was removed from the list.Inclusion in the list also signals to Pentagon suppliers and other US government agencies the military’s assessment of these firms. Some companies listed earlier have challenged their inclusion through legal routes.Responding to the move, an Alibaba spokesperson told Reuters that there was no basis for the inclusion and indicated possible legal action. “Alibaba is not a Chinese military company nor part of any military-civil fusion strategy.”The update to the list could strain ties between Washington and Beijing, particularly after a trade truce agreed between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in October.The list already includes major Chinese firms such as Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL. Tencent had earlier said its business would remain unaffected and that it would seek reconsideration, while CATL said it was “not engaged in any military-related activities”.US lawmakers had earlier urged the Pentagon to expand the list to include several Chinese technology companies, including AI firm DeepSeek, smartphone maker Xiaomi and display manufacturer BOE Technology.Along with YMTC, some firms included last year --such as COSCO SHIPPING Finance Co Ltd and ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc -- have now been removed from the list.","US President Donald Trump has added several major Chinese companies to a Pentagon list of firms allegedly supporting China's military.

The newly released files underscore that even after his conviction, Epstein continued to connect with influential figures.For example, other reporting on the 2026 release shows Epstein’s role in facilitating meetings between business leaders and politicians, including those linked to UAE-Israel diplomatic backchannels and investment networks.","Long-time DP World chief Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem replaced by Essa Kazim.

"US inflation cools to 2.4% in January, near five-year low as gas and housing costs ease",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-inflation-cools-to-2-4-in-january-near-five-year-low-as-gas-and-housing-costs-ease/articleshow/128310871.cms,"A key measure of US inflation fell to nearly a five-year low in January as apartment rental price growth slowed and gas prices declined, offering some relief to consumers after years of sharp cost increases.Inflation dropped to 2.4% in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.7% in December and moving closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, AP reported. Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.5% year-on-year in January, down from 2.6% the previous month and marking the smallest increase since March 2021.The data suggests inflationary pressures could be easing, though it comes after prices of food, fuel and housing surged following the pandemic, leaving overall consumer prices about 25% higher than five years ago. The broad rise in costs has become a major political issue around affordability.On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.2% in January from December, while core prices increased 0.3%.The report may signal cooling inflation, though economists note that prices often rise more in January as companies reset pricing at the start of the year. While gas prices are expected to have declined, grocery costs could see upward pressure after rising in December.Inflation had surged to 9.1% in 2022 amid strong consumer spending and supply chain disruptions following the pandemic. It declined through 2023, stabilised around 3% by mid-2024, and has since improved only gradually.Inflation softened slightly in late 2025, partly reflecting distortions caused by a six-week government shutdown that disrupted data collection, leading to estimates for housing costs that economists said may have artificially lowered inflation readings.At the same time, wage growth has slowed as hiring momentum weakened, reducing workers’ bargaining power. Lower wage growth can ease inflation pressure as businesses face less cost pressure to raise prices.More moderate wage gains are a key reason many economists expect inflation to continue easing this year.“We're not expecting inflation to start up again by any stretch,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust, AP quoted him as saying.Some businesses are still absorbing tariff-related costs, though economists expect companies may raise prices in coming months to offset those expenses. However, most forecasts suggest inflation will decline further by the second half of the year and move closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target by the end of 2026.","Inflation dropped to 2.4% in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.7% in December.

India is in discussions with China-related Ant International to allow integration of the digital payments platform Alipay+ with the country’s instant payments system, Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The move could ease cross-border transactions for Indian travellers across merchants that have signed up with Alipay+, Reuters reported, citing two government sources.This would heavily simplify the overseas spending and reduce the costs associated with cross-border payments.Ant International, headquartered in Singapore and founded by China’s Ant Group, now operates independently.According to Reuters, talks between Indian government and central bank officials with the firm indicate a thaw in bilateral economic engagement between New Delhi and Beijing.Alipay+ currently connects about 1.8 billion user accounts with more than 150 million merchants across over 100 markets, including several in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.Meanwhile, UPI has become a cornerstone of India’s fintech infrastructure, handling nearly 18 billion transactions monthly.Indian authorities have been keen to extend UPI’s international reach to enable smoother digital payments in Indian rupees for travellers and overseas Indians.However, final approval for the Alipay+ integration will depend on security evaluations.“There are sensitivities involved in terms of geopolitical positioning or in securing the country’s digital infrastructure and data because of Alipay’s roots in China,” Reuters reported, citing sources.India continues to enforce strict investment regulations for Chinese firms introduced after the 2020 border standoff, and those curbs remain in place.Strained relations between India and China after their 2020 border standoff slowed the flow of capital, technology and talent between the two neighbours, with New Delhi tightening scrutiny of investments by China-based firms or those with China-linked ownership, according to Reuters. The curbs have stalled or delayed several projects, including Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD’s proposed 1 billion dollar investment plan in an India EV venture.In the past year, however, India has begun cautiously rekindling engagement with Beijing as it navigates punishing U.S. tariffs and shifting global trade patterns, officials said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China in 2025 for the first time in seven years and discussed ways to improve ties in a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.","India is in discussions with China-related Ant International to allow integration of the digital payments platform Alipay+ with the country’s instant payments system, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) The move could ease cross- border transactions for Indian travellers across merchants that have signed up with the platform.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128307560,imgsize-750127,width-400,resizemode-4/upi-and-alipay-talks.jpg"

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas.

Gold Trading Strategy:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold price prediction today: Gold rates have been fluctuating on the back of rapidly changing geopolitical situations, Donald Trump’s tariff moves and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Gold is a safe haven investment in times of uncertainty, but the precious metal has been volatile in trade for the last few weeks after hitting lifetime highs. As investors it is important to watch out for cues.Gold prices had a volatile last week, briefly surging above $3,200 as investors sought safe-haven assets amid a firm U.S. dollar and geopolitical uncertainty, including hopes for a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire following President Trump's meetings with foreign officials.However, gains were short-lived, with gold falling over 2%, marking its worst weekly performance since last November, as risk appetite returned on signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks.Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating added to market caution, citing concerns over mounting debt.Meanwhile, weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data—covering producer prices, retail sales, and industrial production—added to mixed sentiment.Debate intensified in Congress over President Trump’s proposed tax-cut bill, with uncertainty over its passage creating further volatility, especially after Trump warned of significant tax hikes if the bill fails. The U.S. dollar index remained below 100, while Treasury yields climbed sharply. Industrial metals and silver found support from a small cut in China’s loan prime rate, boosting broader economic sentiment. Although stronger dollar moves and profit-taking briefly weighed on gold, fiscal concerns and debt risks helped sustain its safe-haven appeal.Towards the end of the week, Trump threatened a 50% tariff on the EU and a 25% tariff on Apple if it shifts production to India. However, he later rescinded the EU tariff threat, giving the bloc until July to negotiate a trade deal, slightly easing global trade tensions.The upcoming week will focus on Fed speeches and key U.S. GDP, consumer confidence, Inflation and FOMC meeting minutes.Buy above 96,500 for targets of 98,000 and 99,000, strong support is near 94,800 and 93,800.","Gold prices had a volatile last week, briefly surging above $3,200.

"Summer rain: Good for rural sales, hurts urban market; ‘early’ monsoon hits ice cream, soft drink demand in cities where FMCG companies tackle slowdown",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/summer-rain-good-for-rural-sales-hurts-urban-market-early-monsoon-hits-ice-cream-soft-drink-demand-in-cities-where-fmcg-companies-tackle-slowdown/articleshow/121421032.cms,"MUMBAI: A contrasting tale may be playing out in the FMCG space. While the arrival of early monsoons is expected to boost consumption of soaps, shampoos, packaged food, and other household staples in rural areas, which have already been growing faster than urban areas for the past five quarters, summer sales of companies are likely to take a hit.This means that firms with a portfolio skewed towards cold beverages, soft drinks, and ice creams are anticipated to see a slowdown in sales. The impact will be larger in urban areas, which have already been grappling with sluggish overall demand. Soft drinks and ice creams, typically seen as impulse categories, also tend to have a higher frequency of purchases in urban markets where the rise of quick commerce platforms allows firms to reach consumers at their doorstep in minutes.Already, summer sales in urban regions had seen a dip due to unseasonal rains in some parts of the country earlier this month, and the early showers will add to it, said Mayank Shah, VP at Parle Products. Since last week, summer sales have dived at kirana stores in certain parts of the country, All India Consumer Products Distributors' Federation president Dhairyashil Patil said. ""Few days' sales have been lost,"" Patil said, adding that an onset of early summers should support total sales for the season.""While the outlook for rural consumption is optimistic, buoyed by strong monsoons and improved agricultural output, urban recovery, which has seen marginal improvement, will see an impact, especially on summer categories, owing to early rains. Amid these consumption trends, companies with a rural focus are expected to benefit from the early and good monsoon. However, companies focused on urban markets will see limited offtake immediately,"" said Manish Anandani, MD at Kenvue India, who expects urban demand revival to set in only after the Sept quarter.Ice cream players are already readjusting their growth projections for the season. ""Early rains, storms, and cooler days have made it (month of May) more like the monsoon season rather than peak summer. Consequently, ice creams seem to have dropped from the wish list of consumers a couple of notches for now. This is likely to impact our as well as the industry's robust growth projections to more modest numbers,"" said Mohit Khattar, CEO, Graviss Foods, which holds the master franchise rights for Baskin Robbins in India.The monsoon hit Kerala on May 24, eight days ahead of its normal arrival date of June 1, the earliest onset since 2009. Rains have also advanced to a few other parts of the country. If the spread of monsoon is even and helps improve (crop) yield, it will boost farmer incomes, helping consumption, said Mohit Malhotra, CEO at Dabur India. ""We will continue to drive growth in rural through increased penetration in the hinterland while urban demand growth would ride on our premiumisation initiatives in e-commerce and modern trade channels,"" Malhotra said.Together with a good crop and govt's policy reforms, early monsoons can fuel consumption demand, especially in rural India, said Shuvadip Banerjee, chief digital marketing officer at ITC, which is deploying mobile vans to ensure delivery to the remotest corners of rural India.","Early monsoons expected to boost consumption of soaps, shampoos, packaged food, and other household staples in rural areas.

NEW DELHI: While American President Donald Trump's focus is on the $45 billion trade deficit with India, a paper released Monday estimated that the US ""quietly rakes in"" $80-85 billion from India through education, digital services, financial operations, royalty on intellectual property, and defence exports.""These massive earnings don't show up in the narrow goods trade statistics. When you factor them in, the US isn't running a deficit with India at all - it's sitting on a $35-40 billion surplus,"" trade researcher GTRI said, while suggesting that govt should negotiate hard. The report comes at a time when India and the US are engaged in talks for a bilateral trade deal amid repeated attacks by Trump, who at one point claimed that America's trade deficit with India was to the tune of $100 billion.It said one of the biggest beneficiaries is the US education sector, where Indian students end up spending an estimated $25 billion annually on university education. The likes of Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft mop up $15-20 billion a year through app sales, cloud services, and ad revenue, gaining from ""limited local rules on data & taxation"" in the country.Further, GTRI pegged revenues of consulting firms and investment banks at $10-15 billion and estimated that US pharma companies raked in close to $2 billion via patents, drug licensing arrangements, and tech transfer. Similarly, American auto majors earned between $800,000 and $1.2 billion in licensing and technical services.

What about growth and competition?

Harmohan Sahni, the CEO of Raymond Realty, recently shared insights on the state of the real estate market in a Q4FY25 investors call. He pointed out that while the luxury segment shows signs of fatigue, the premium market where they operate remains strong.It's like that once-loved shirt you wear a bit too often; it’s still stylish, but maybe it's time for a wash. The luxury real estate scene, while less populated and showcasing high inventory levels, has inventory mainly in the hands of reliable developers, according to Sahni.""My personal view is that on the luxury side, there’s some kind of tiredness, "" Sahni explained. He reiterated that the current luxury market remains smaller, with fewer players participating actively. Despite this lull, the good news is that the inventory is in capable hands, which matters a lot during such slowdowns.When Sahni discussed various market segments, he highlighted the steady demand for premium real estate. ""We are playing in deep markets, so volumes are very, very strong,“ he said, showing confidence in their ongoing projects.Thane, a rapidly developing area near Mumbai, continues to thrive despite fierce competition.Sahni noted, ""As the market has expanded, so has our share, "" which is quite heartening for potential homeowners looking for stable investment choices.Raymond Realty has been actively introducing new projects, including significant developments in areas like Mahim and Wadala. Their push into the Pune market is also on the cards, looking to tap into the growing demand.""The residential segment is a massive opportunity—after all, in a country like India, everyone aspires to own a home, "" he remarked. It's a well-known fact but worth remembering, especially with the right products targeting the right buyers.With about six or seven major markets contributing to 70-80% of the national market value, establishing a strong position in these areas is crucial. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) stands out as a significant player, and getting a foothold there is part of the plan.Interestingly, Sahni clarified that Raymond isn't looking at the luxury or very affordable segments; instead, they are focusing on what he described as ""affordable luxury. "" It's like looking for a good quality mid-range phone rather than a flagship model—offering better value without going into the super-luxury territory.Since entering the real estate game in 2019 with their first project in Thane, Raymond Realty has progressively built its brand, launching projects like 'The Address by GS' in Bandra and solidifying its presence over the past few years.","Harmohan Sahni, the CEO of Raymond Realty, recently shared insights on the state of the real estate market.

"Covid-19 is now endemic, like flu: Expert",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/covid-19-is-now-endemic-like-flu-expert/articleshow/121404673.cms,"



HYDERABAD: In light of recent spurt in Covid-19 cases, scientists and public health experts believe that the current variants are not a major concern. They emphasize that there is no need for a rush to vaccinate or extreme measures, as the scientific community and the public have learned how to manage the situation effectively.Also, Covid-19 has transitioned from a pandemic to an endemic disease (regularly found in a particular place or among a particular group of people and difficult to get rid of) like seasonal flu.N Madhusudhana Rao, CEO of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) Incubation Centre, told TOI many measures implemented during first and second waves of Covid-19 were unnecessary. He highlighted that without extensive surveys on the vaccines administered, it would be challenging to determine which vaccines remain effective. Until recently, several Covid-19 viruses were cultured for research purposes at the incubation centre.""During the first wave, we didn't know much about the virus. For instance, we saw bleach being sprayed on roads, even though the virus spreads through the air; that measure was not necessary. I can also say that some steroids were given to people who were only mildly affected due to a lack of awareness. Over time, we realised that basic treatment was sufficient for those without co-morbidities,"" he said.The administration of vaccines was a major initiative during the third and fourth waves globally, he added.""Now, we must determine which vaccines are still effective, given that the current vaccines were developed based on variants from those earlier waves. Numerous vaccines were distributed worldwide, so a survey is needed to assess their efficacy,"" the CCMB expert said.In the initial years, CCMB had maintained live Covid-19 viruses in highly secured labs to assist companies developing vaccines, but that activity has ceased, and genome sequencing has stopped.Rao said Covid-19 (a pandemic) has transitioned into an endemic phase (like seasonal flu), as evidenced by evolving patterns of SARS-CoV-2 variants across different countries. Up until the emergence of the JN.1 variant, there was a relatively uniform global pattern in variant circulation. However, after the JN.1 variant, this trend shifted, with each country now demonstrating its own distinct evolutionary trajectories, he added.",Scientists and public health experts believe that the current variants are not a major concern. They emphasize that there is no need for a rush to vaccinate or extreme measures.

Who is Anushka Yadav? The mystery girl seen in 'expelled' RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav's Facebook post,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/who-is-anushka-yadav-the-mystery-girl-seen-with-expelled-rjd-leader-tej-pratap-yadav/articleshow/121405420.cms,"Who is Anushka Yadav?

(With agency inputs)





NEW DELHI: A social media post featuring former Bihar minister Tej Pratap Yadav alongside a young woman named Anushka Yadav has triggered a wave of curiosity and controversy.The now-deleted viral Facebook post claimed the two had been in a relationship for the past 12 years. While Tej Pratap later alleged that his account had been hacked and that the post was part of an attempt to defame him and his family, the name Anushka Yadav has since become the centre of widespread public speculation.Very little is known about Anushka Yadav in the public domain. She appears to maintain a low profile, with no confirmed links to any political family or public profession. Sources suggest that Anushka is not from a political background, which makes her alleged connection to the RJD leader all the more intriguing.Speculation about her identity intensified after the viral post described her as someone Tej Pratap had ""been in love with for the past 12 years"". The post further stated:""The one seen in this picture is Anushka Yadav. We have known each other for the last 12 years. We are in love and have been in a relationship for 12 years.""This revelation — if genuine — would imply that their alleged relationship predates Tej Pratap's high-profile marriage to Aishwarya Rai , the granddaughter of former Bihar CM Daroga Rai in 2018.Tej Pratap Yadav, the elder son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to deny the authenticity of the post.""My social media platform was hacked and my photographs were edited wrongfully. This is an attempt to defame and harass me and my family,"" he said.Despite the denial, the post had already garnered wide attention.“I urge all my supporters to stay alert and not believe in any baseless rumours being spread on social media,” Yadav said.Following the controversy, RJD president Lalu Prasad expelled Tej Pratap Yadav, from the party and severed all family ties with him, citing “irresponsible” conduct and a disregard for moral values.While Lalu Prasad did not directly refer to the controversial post in his own statement, he strongly criticised Tej Pratap’s behaviour, saying:“Disregard for moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle to achieve social justice. His actions are not in consonance with the values of my family.”“He shall have no role, henceforth, in the party and the family. He is expelled from the party for six years, Lalu Prasad added”While the authenticity of the post remains in question, and with Tej Pratap calling it a hoax, Anushka Yadav remains a mystery figure. Whether the post was a result of hacking, mischief, or something more personal, the incident has once again brought Tej Pratap’s personal life under the spotlight.A few months ago, he made headlines for threatening a policeman in his security detail with suspension upon refusal to dance as per his command and speeding on a two-wheeler without wearing a helmet.Earlier, he had been in the news for an ugly marital dispute, besides antics like supporting rebels in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, floating a parallel outfit ""Lalu Rabri Morcha"" and occupying the chair reserved for the national president while at the RJD office.",The now-deleted viral Facebook post claimed the two had been in a relationship for the past 12 years.

Markets brace for key economic data as trade tensions and Trump’s EU tariff reprieve test investor sentiment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/wall-street-today-dow-nasdaq-trade-concerns-trump-delays-eu-tariffs-us-stock-market-update/articleshow/121416486.cms,"Photo -AP

US markets are set to test President Donald Trump’s announcement to delay a threatened 50 per cent tariff on European Union goods until July 9.Earlier, European stock markets rallied on Monday after US President Donald Trump postponed his threat to impose 50 per cent tariffs on European Union goods, pushing the deadline to July 9 to allow more time for negotiations. Trump had roiled markets late last week by warning that the steep duties could take effect from June 1, citing a lack of progress in trade talks with the EU.On Sunday, Trump eased investor concerns by announcing he would delay the tariffs after a ""very nice call"" with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. According to Trump, von der Leyen said she “wants to get down to serious negotiations.” In response, von der Leyen pledged to move “swiftly” to reach a deal.Following the news, the Paris CAC 40 index rose 1.2 per cent in midday trading, and Germany’s DAX gained 1.7 per cent, reflecting market optimism. While London and Wall Street remained closed for holidays, US futures climbed, although most Asian markets struggled to maintain gains.Analysts pointed to growing investor anxiety over the unpredictability of US trade policy. “The stock market seems to dance to Trump’s tune: first a threat, then a pullback, quickly followed by a rebound as speculative investors anticipate a concession,” said Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.“This morning’s confirmation of such expectations reinforces the so-called ‘Trump Pattern’, which is increasingly seen as a successful strategy for risk-tolerant investors,” he added.Meanwhile, the US dollar remained under pressure following last week's drop. Concerns are also mounting over Trump’s fiscal strategy, particularly after long-term US Treasury yields surged last week. Investors fear that tax cuts and spending plans approved by the House could balloon the national debt.Markets are also bracing for key economic data this week. The Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes, due Wednesday, and Friday’s release of the US personal consumption expenditures index — the Fed’s preferred inflation measure — are likely to provide clues on the central bank’s policy outlook. These key events are expected to shape investor sentiment and the broader economic narrative moving forward.In corporate news, Samsung shares edged up 1 per cent in Seoul, despite being among the smartphone makers threatened with new US tariffs. In Tokyo, Nippon Steel saw a sharp rally, rising as much as 7.4 per cent before closing 2.1 per cent higher. This came after Trump voiced support for the Japanese firm's proposed $14.9 billion acquisition of US Steel, a deal he claimed would keep the US Steel headquarters in Pittsburgh and generate 70,000 jobs along with $14 billion in economic value. However, neither the White House nor the companies involved have released formal details of this proposed partnership.In currency markets, the euro rose to $1.1384, the pound edged up to $1.3563, and the dollar gained slightly to 142.84 yen. The euro/pound exchange dipped slightly to 83.93 pence.","US markets set to test President Donald Trump’s announcement to delay a threatened 50 per cent tariff on European Union goods until July 9.

Why it’s so hard to buy 'Made in America': Shoppers face tough choices despite strong intentions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/why-its-so-hard-to-buy-made-in-america-shoppers-face-tough-choices-despite-strong-intentions/articleshow/121412982.cms,"For many Americans, buying products labelled “Made in the USA” is more than a patriotic act — it’s a commitment to supporting domestic workers and industries. But despite the desire, the reality of sticking to American-made goods is far more complicated than many expect.Dianna Huff, a 62-year-old New Hampshire resident, has spent more than a decade trying to buy only American-made products. While she’s succeeded with items like sheets, socks, and sofas, others — including her phone, glasses, and bathroom scale — have proven impossible to find without a foreign label. “It’s been a real journey that’s come with frustrations and misadventures,” Huff said as quoted by The Wall Street Journal.Her challenge reflects a broader trend. Global supply chains built over decades have made some categories nearly impossible to source domestically. For example, nearly half of all new passenger vehicles sold in the US in 2024 were assembled outside the country, according to S&P Global Mobility. Smartphones — nearly all of which are manufactured overseas — are another major hurdle.While many consumers are willing to pay more for American-made products, cost remains a barrier.A Morning Consult survey found that while more than half of US adults intentionally buy domestic goods at least sometimes, only 11% are willing to absorb a price increase of more than 15%. And for some items — like smartphones or certain tools — US-made versions are simply not available.Matt Braynard, a 47-year-old political consultant from Northern Virginia, has spent the last five years committed to buying American. He swapped imported designer clothes for US-made apparel, including jeans from Imogene + Willie, shirts from 1620 Workwear, and New Balance sneakers. While his choices cost more upfront, Braynard believes they last longer. “It isn’t always easy,” he said. “When I walk through a shopping mall… there’s really nothing for me there. ”Even committed shoppers make concessions. Anne Collins, 75, runs a Facebook group called Have Fun Buying Not Made in China. Though she’s helped members find US-made foil pans, artificial flowers, and mops, she admits that even her carefully curated Easter basket included some imported knickknacks.Despite increasing demand and political pushback — including steep tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump — rebuilding America’s manufacturing base will require more than consumer willpower. For now, living a truly “Made in America” life remains an admirable but difficult mission.",More than half of US adults intentionally buy domestic goods at least sometimes.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's wide-reaching tariff policies are beginning to take a toll on American consumers, with major companies announcing price hikes to counter rising import costs.Trump's administration has imposed a 10% baseline tariff on most imports and a 30% duty on Chinese goods, with some categories, such as steel and aluminum, facing even steeper rates.While a recent temporary deal reduced some tariffs on Chinese products, businesses are still grappling with increased costs and continued uncertainty over future trade policies.A growing number of major brands—including Walmart, Mattel, Ford, and Best Buy—have announced or hinted at price hikes as a direct result of Trump’s renewed tariff policies.The sweeping import duties, especially on goods from China, are pushing companies to pass rising costs on to consumers.Walmart said on April 15 it would raise prices due to “high” tariffs on Chinese-made products. CEO Doug McMillon stated that the company would try to keep prices low but acknowledged that “the magnitude of these tariffs makes it impossible to absorb all the pressure.”Mattel the toy giant behind Barbie, revealed plans on May 6 to increase prices, though it aims to keep 40–50% of its products priced under $20.CEO Ynon Kreiz said that although nearly half its products will still be priced under $20, others will increase in cost due to tariff pressures. He also called for the removal of tariffs on toys globally.Best Buy warned during its March earnings call that suppliers were increasing prices across product lines, with those costs likely to be passed on to consumers—especially if temporary exemptions for electronics expire.Shein and Temu popular Chinese e-commerce platforms, have also raised prices following Trump’s move to eliminate the “de minimis” exemption that spared low-cost imports from tariffs. Temu patio chairs jumped from $61.72 to $70.17, while Shein’s swimsuit sets saw a 91% price spike.Imported cars now face a 25% tariff, prompting Ford to raise vehicle prices up to 1.5% in the second half of 2025. Ford also confirmed sticker price hikes for three Mexico-made models. Subaru said it is adjusting prices on several models due to ""market conditions.""Ralph Lauren plans to increase prices more aggressively than previously planned. Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden warned that tariffs would “eventually cause higher costs” across all US product lines. Nike is also set to raise prices starting June 1, though it did not officially link the move to tariffs.As tariffs reshape global supply chains and retail economics, consumers are already beginning to feel the impact at the checkout counter, and the trend may intensify if trade tensions escalate.","US President Donald Trump's wide-reaching tariff policies are beginning to take a toll on American consumers.

Nissan bets on hybrid e-Power technology to drive turnaround amid financial struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nissan-bets-on-hybrid-e-power-technology-to-drive-turnaround-amid-financial-struggles/articleshow/121411794.cms,"Struggling Japanese automaker Nissan is banking on its proprietary ""e-Power"" hybrid technology to help fuel a much-needed business revival. The technology, already available in select models, uses both an electric motor and a gasoline engine—similar to Toyota’s Prius—but operates differently in a key way: the car is always powered by the electric motor, providing a consistently quiet and smooth driving experience.“Nissan has a proud history of pioneering innovative technology that set us apart,” said Chief Technology Officer Eiichi Akashi during a media event at the company's Grandrive test track outside Tokyo, AP reported.Unlike typical plug-in EVs, e-Power vehicles don’t require external charging. The battery is powered solely by the gasoline engine, allowing drivers to refuel at gas stations without worrying about charging infrastructure—offering a unique middle ground between conventional hybrids and full electric vehicles Nissan Motor Corp., which posted a $4.5 billion loss for the fiscal year ending in March, is pinning its hopes on e-Power as part of a broader turnaround strategy. The company faces significant challenges in the U.S. market, where President Donald Trump's tariff policies have complicated matters for Japanese automakers.To reverse its fortunes, Nissan is pursuing cost-cutting initiatives, strengthening partnerships, and reshaping its vehicle lineup—with e-Power technology playing a key role in that effort, according to Akashi.As part of its recovery plan, Nissan recently announced it would cut 15% of its global workforce—around 20,000 employees—and reduce its manufacturing footprint from 17 plants to 10. The restructuring is being led by new Chief Executive Ivan Espinosa.Currently, e-Power technology is available in the Nissan Qashqai and X-Trail in Europe, and the Note in Japan. The U.S. market will see the upgraded system introduced in the upcoming Rogue model. While pricing for the new e-Power vehicles has not yet been disclosed, the only other automaker offering a similar setup is Suzuki Motor Corp., which incorporates it in its compact ""kei"" cars.Nissan, an early innovator in electric vehicles with the launch of the Leaf in 2010, is also working on enhanced EV models and is developing solid-state batteries—a potential replacement for the lithium-ion batteries now used in EVs, hybrids, and e-Power systems.Despite these efforts, analysts caution that Nissan is facing serious financial risks and may soon need external support. Speculation has emerged that the company may sell its Yokohama headquarters building or repurpose one of its domestic factories into a casino to raise funds.The company was previously in discussions with rival Honda Motor Co. regarding a possible business integration but announced in February that those talks had been called off.","Nissan is banking on its ""e-Power"" hybrid technology to help fuel a much-needed business revival.

Travel outlook

Memorial Day, which had traditionally been observed on May 30 to honor America’s fallen service members, officially became a federal holiday in 1971 and is now held on the last Monday in May. Over the years, it has also become one of the busiest weekends for retail sales and travel across the United States.All government offices, including post offices, courts, and public schools, will be closed for the holiday.US stock markets and most banks will be closed on Monday.FedEx and UPS will not offer regular pickup and delivery services, although some specialized services may still be available, according to an AP report.Most major retailers will remain open, many offering Memorial Day sales to attract shoppers. Warehouse club Costco will be closed. Store hours may vary depending on location.Memorial Day also marks the unofficial start of the summer travel season. This year, Americans are expected to hit the road and skies in record numbers despite economic concerns and recent disruptions in the travel sector.AAA forecasts that more than 45 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 1.4 million more than last year — setting a new Memorial Day travel record. The previous record of 44 million domestic travellers was set two decades ago.Drivers will likely pay less for fuel than last year. According to AAA’s fuel tracker, the national average for a gallon of regular gas was $3.18 on Wednesday, down from $3.60 at the same time last year.An estimated 39.4 million people are expected to travel by car, the highest number recorded for Memorial Day since AAA began tracking in 2000. Air travel is also up slightly, with 3.61 million expected to fly — nearly 2% more than the 3.55 million who travelled by air last year.Traveller confidence in air safety has been shaken by a number of recent incidents, including a deadly mid-air collision in January between a passenger jet and a US Army helicopter over Washington, D.C., which killed 67 people. There have also been multiple close calls in US airspace.Further concerns have been raised by ongoing flight delays and cancellations due to an air traffic controller shortage and equipment problems at a key facility handling traffic in and out of Newark, New Jersey.","US stock markets and most banks will be closed on Monday.

‘Pak Army, ISI Agents Entered…’: J&K EX-CM Exposes Islamabad In Arab Nation

A recent World Bank study has found that Pakistan’s General Sales Tax (GST) is a major contributor to rising poverty levels, while targeted cash transfer schemes such as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) are helping reduce inequality.Titled “The Effects of Taxes and Transfers on Inequality and Poverty in Pakistan,” the report reveals that GST consumes more than 7 per cent of households’ pre-tax spending, disproportionately burdening low-income families and deepening financial stress. Citing the study, a report in Dawn, quoted by news agency PTI, on Sunday noted that GST is the single most significant fiscal policy factor driving up national poverty rates.Education spending- particularly at the pre-primary and primary levels- was identified as the second-largest contributor to inequality, according to the report.In contrast, the BISP emerged as the most effective tool in narrowing inequality. The programme, which provides monthly financial support to the poorest households, has shown the most meaningful impact among all assessed fiscal interventions.The World Bank study calls for Pakistan to enhance domestic revenue collection and improve expenditure efficiency.It urges the government to create additional fiscal space through reforms and to channel those resources into expanding social protection and improving the quality and reach of essential public services.Crucially, the report criticises Pakistan’s current taxation system for its dependence on indirect taxes, which are seen as more impoverishing, and on regressive subsidies. It highlights the lack of emphasis on progressive direct taxation, which would better target higher-income groups.The analysis also points to a stark imbalance in the fiscal system: the poorest households are effectively net contributors, paying more in taxes than they receive in benefits.",A recent World Bank study has found that Pakistan’s General Sales Tax (GST) is a major contributor to rising poverty levels.

China's digital product sales hit $20 billion in four months due to government subsidies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-digital-product-sales-hit-20-billion-in-four-months-due-to-government-subsidies/articleshow/121383672.cms,"The Chinese government's subsidies aimed at boosting domestic consumption have led to a surge in the sales of digital products like smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches, generating about $20 billion in just four months, according to the Ministry of Commerce.As of Thursday, over 48 million consumers participated in the government’s digital product subsidy scheme, purchasing a total of 51.48 million products and driving approximately 143.3 billion yuan (around $19.9 billion) in sales, the ministry reported on Friday, as reported PTI.Between January and April, retail sales of communication appliances rose 25.4 per cent compared to the same period last year, marking the fastest growth among 16 major consumer goods categories, data from the ministry showed.In January, China introduced new measures to expand the scope of its consumer goods trade-in programme. The government increased the number of home appliance categories eligible for subsidies from eight in 2024 to 12 in 2025.Large-scale equipment upgrades and consumer goods trade-in initiatives were launched in March 2024 and revamped earlier this year to boost domestic demand and spur economic growth.Under the subsidy programme, consumers purchasing smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, or wristbands priced below 6,000 yuan ($850) are eligible for a subsidy covering 15 per cent of the sales price, up to a maximum of 500 yuan ($71) per item.The programme is available for both domestic and foreign brands.The Chinese government has been encouraging efforts to enhance domestic demand to strengthen the economy and counter external risks amid growing trade tensions with the US.These subsidies have led millions of Chinese consumers to upgrade their devices, benefiting both domestic and foreign brands. According to reports from official media, the government also offers a subsidy of 20,000 yuan (around $2,850) for electric vehicles.The Ministry of Commerce noted that the digital product subsidy policies have contributed to a market shift towards higher-end products.Third-party data revealed that the sales volume of smartphones priced between 2,000 yuan ($278) and 4,000 yuan ($570) increased by 13 per cent year-on-year during the first four months of 2025, while sales of smartphones in the 4,000 to 6,000 yuan ($850) range surged by 43 per cent.","As of Thursday, over 48 million consumers participated in the government’s digital product subsidy scheme, purchasing a total of 51.48 million products.

Asian currencies set for long-term appreciation against US dollar: Jefferies report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-currencies-set-for-long-term-appreciation-against-us-dollar-jefferies-report/articleshow/121383409.cms,"Asian currencies are expected to appreciate against the US dollar in the long term, driven by higher gross national savings in emerging Asian economies compared to developed G7 nations, according to a recent report by Jefferies.The report pointed out that the gross national savings in emerging Asian countries are significantly higher, providing these economies with a robust foundation for currency strength. “The most likely currency bloc to enjoy long-term appreciation against the US dollar remains Asian currencies in what amounts to a reversal of the dynamic triggered by the Asian Crisis nearly 30 years ago,” the report noted as quoted ANI.This shift, the report added, not only stems from changes in US trade policies under the Trump administration but also reflects the growing financial strength of many Asian countries.The Jefferies report further highlighted that the Trump administration’s focus on targeting mercantilist economies has played a role in shaping this trend, with Taiwan being noted as the leading practitioner of mercantilism in the region.Beyond trade policies, the report emphasized the region's substantial savings, which are key to supporting currency appreciation. In 2024, gross national savings in emerging Asia (excluding Taiwan and Korea) stood at 39 per cent of GDP, compared to 20.1 per cent for G7 countries and 17.3 per cent for another unnamed group.The report also discussed the economic situation in the United States, noting that the risk of a near-term recession has reduced significantly, primarily due to the Trump administration’s decision to step back from its previous tariff plans. These tariffs, if implemented, could have led to higher costs for ordinary Americans and acted as a regressive tax in a country already grappling with severe income inequality.According to 2022 data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the top 1 per cent of Americans earned 22.4 per cent of total gross individual income and paid 40.4 per cent of all income taxes. The top 10 per cent accounted for nearly half of the income (49.4 per cent) and paid 72 per cent of the taxes. In contrast, the bottom 50 per cent of Americans earned only 11.5 per cent of the income and contributed just 3 per cent to income tax collections. In 2023, individual income tax accounted for 53.5 per cent of total tax collections in the US.","Asian currencies are expected to appreciate against the US dollar in the long term.

Need for macroeconomic structure:

Forex restructure:

The International Monetary Fund said that it was in talks with Pakistan, holding “constructive discussions” focused on the FY2025-26 budget and key economic reforms. The IMF team began high-level policy talks on 19 May in Islamabad and are expected to continue in the coming days.However, with no final agreement reached, its government pushed back the announcement of the budget to 10 June.The negotiations are part of Pakistan's ongoing efforts to secure continued support under the IMF’s loan arrangements.“We held constructive discussions with the authorities on their FY2026 budget proposals and broader economic policy, and reform agenda supported by the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the 2025 Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF),” said Nathan Porter, the IMF’s mission chief, in a statement quoted by PTI.The current round of talks revolved around revenue enhancement, including better tax compliance and expanding the tax base, alongside prioritising expenditure.""The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation while safeguarding social and priority expenditures, aiming for a primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of GDP in FY2026,"" Porter said.Energy sector reform was high on the agenda.Porter said that these discussions aimed towards reducing the cost structure of Pakistan’s power sector and improving its financial stability, moves seen as vital to economic sustainability and investor confidence.The IMF highlighted the importance of a sound macroeconomic framework, saying that maintaining an “appropriately tight and data-dependent monetary policy remains a priority to ensure inflation is maintained within the bank's medium-term target range of 5–7 per cent.Porter also raised the need to rebuild the country’s foreign exchange reserves and support a fully functioning exchange rate market. Rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, maintaining a well-functioning forex market and increasing exchange rate flexibility are essential for boosting resilience against external shocks, he said.The IMF said its next mission to Pakistan, as part of the upcoming EFF and RSF reviews, is expected in the second half of 2025.Pakistan signed a $7 billion extended fund facility with the IMF last year and has received two tranches so far, including the most recent disbursal earlier this month.The approval came despite objections from India's objections that the funds may be diverted to finance cross border terrorism. On 16 May, defence minister Rajnath Singh urged the IMF to rethink the support, claiming that the funds could be diverted by Islamabad to boost its terror activities.","IMF team began high-level policy talks on 19 May in Islamabad.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford.

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.

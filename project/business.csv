Trump's H-1B visa fee hike: What it means





US President Donald Trump ’s move to sharply hike the fee for H-1B visas to $100,000 has Indian tech sector workers and students in America worried about their future in the world’s largest economy. Trump’s move is aimed at addressing worries about US technology workers who believe they lose out on jobs due to immigrant professionals.The H-1B skilled-worker visa programme, which is mainly utilised by the technology sector, has traditionally served as a crucial entry route for foreign professionals into the United States, with Indian nationals comprising approximately 70% of recipients.Now these professionals and students face a significant impact as the Trump administration revises the programme.Indian parents have over the years consistently encouraged their offspring to pursue academic paths—specifically engineering—believing these would provide optimal employment prospects.The Indian Institutes of Technology have produced exceptional English-proficient computer specialists and engineers who became highly sought after in the United States, according to a Wall Street Journal report.Britta Glennon, an economist and assistant professor of management at the Wharton School specialising in immigration and innovation research, told WSJ that Indians demonstrated exceptional engagement with the H-1B programme following its establishment in 1990.The achievements of Indian technology professionals who received H-1B visa s inspired more Indian students to pursue similar educational paths, according to Glennon. A notable example is Sundar Pichai, who now leads Alphabet. Indians comprised more than one-third of successful H-1B visa recipients by 2003.Also Read | The $100,000 H-1B gamble: Why Donald Trump’s visa tax won’t save American jobs - winners and losers In 2007, when visa applications exceeded available positions, US authorities implemented a lottery-based allocation system.US employees, according to the report, have lodged multiple complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Tata Consultancy Services, India's largest technology services organisation, claiming they were dismissed and their positions were filled by H-1B visa holders.Last year, TCS received 5,500 H-1B visas, placing it second to Amazon's allocation of over 14,000. The yearly limit stands at 85,000 visas, with educational institutions being exempt from this restriction.TCS has previously stated that these allegations lack substance and emphasised its proven track record as an equal-opportunity employer within the United States.According to research by Colgate University economists Rishi R. Sharma and Chad Sparber quoted in the report, the change to lottery system led Indian outsourcing companies—which provide tech services to American businesses through combined US-based and India-based teams—to submit many applications to enhance their chances of securing H-1B visas.Subsequently, these Indian service providers began lending their surplus US-based Indian employees to clients, triggering protests from American workers who felt they were being displaced through domestic outsourcing.Experts note that whilst outsourcing companies must legally demonstrate payment above certain thresholds, the compensation offered to H-1B employees at these firms typically falls in the lower range for similar positions.Indian outsourcing companies indicate they have reduced their dependence on H-1B visas whilst focusing on training and employing American workers.Also Read | Alternatives to H-1B visas: After fee hike by Trump to $100,000, O1 & L1 visas gain traction; check cost, approval rates US is implementing new changes to the H-1B visa programme. The new fee structure will be introduced for first-time applicants beginning next year, alongside plans to modify the lottery system to prioritise applications with higher salary offerings.The increased fees may be a deterrent for startups. Siddharth Sarasvati, at Trial and Error, an AI starup told WSJ that the increased fee poses challenges for startups like theirs.""H-1B needed reform,"" said Sarasvati. ""But this isn't reform, it's a sledgehammer…this ensures that only companies with the deepest pockets can play.""India could potentially gain advantages from stricter US visa regulations affecting Indian technology professionals. According to experts, India's technological advancement partly resulted from professionals returning after unsuccessful H-1B applications, contributing to the development of centres like Bengaluru.Industry experts are debating the potential global impact of the proposed new visa fee on the IT workforce landscape. Vivek Wadhwa, who leads Vionix Biosciences and previously served as a distinguished fellow at Harvard Law School and Carnegie Mellon, highlighted serious implications for the United States.""Trump's $100,000 H-1B fee is economic suicide for America. It will force Indian talent to go home, taking with them skills, savings, and global experience. Indian engineers have been trapped in limbo for years because of endless visa backlogs. Trump has just pushed them to make the obvious choice: return home where opportunities are greater,"" he was quoted as saying by TOI. Wadhwa noted that this reverse migration would significantly advantage India. ""They will bring capital, networks, and the knowhow of scaling companies globally.""""Donald Trump's 100,000 H-1B fee will choke U.S. innovation, and turbocharge India's,"" said Amitabh Kant, the former head of an Indian government-policy think tank, in a post on X. ""By slamming the door on global talent, America pushes the next wave of labs, patents, innovation and startups to Bangalore and Hyderabad, Pune and Gurgaon.""Also Read | Trump’s H-1B visa fee hike to backfire? Wall Street banks set to rely more on Indian GCCs; may deepen presence in India Despite increased opportunities in India over recent years, the country faces challenges. Many technology graduates struggle to secure well-compensated positions amongst the large talent pool.The work environment remains considerably more hierarchical compared to the United States, according to technology professionals quoted in the report. Additionally, artificial intelligence developments could reduce entry-level positions.A 31-year-old software engineer based in Albany, N.Y., who arrived in the US in 2017 for doctoral studies, highlighted the disparity in professional opportunities. ""India has a lot of good schools to train engineers but nothing much to engage them after graduation,"" he remarked. He obtained his H-1B visa in 2022 during his company's first application attempt.Despite finding the visa's single-employer restriction limiting, he appreciates the American technology sector's environment. He and his spouse, also an H-1B holder, are considering alternative skilled-worker visa pathways to stay in the US, particularly if H-1B regulations become stricter. They view Canada as an alternative destination rather than returning home, the WSJ report said.Destinations such as Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada are actively seeking to attract skilled professionals from India.As the United States tightens its immigration policies for skilled workers, nations including Germany, Canada and the UK have positioned themselves as welcoming alternatives for Indian technology experts, according to an ET report.","US President Donald Trump ’s move to sharply hike the fee for H-1B visas to $100,000 has Indian tech sector workers and students in America worried about their future in the world’s largest economy.

Seoul pledged $350 billion for projects in the United States, but made clear the funds would come through loans, guarantees and equity rather than a direct cash payment.Meanwhile, President Lee Jae Myung also warned in an interview with Reuters that paying such a sum without financial safeguards, like a currency swap, could push the country into crisis despite its $410 billion in foreign exchange reserves.Talks to formalise the deal have stalled, with Seoul opposing Washington’s demands for control over the funds.South Korea hopes to settle the matter at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit it is hosting next month, where Trump is expected to attend.Apart from South Korea, Asia’s fourth largest economy, Trump also quoted a $550 billion deal with Japan.""We have in Japan it's $550 billion, South Korea's $350 billion.

Stock recommendations:

Larsen & Toubro (L&T)

Ashok Leyland

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Stock market recommendations:The benchmark Nifty index recorded a steep fall of 2.65% over the past week, wiping out more than 60% of the gains it had built up in the preceding three weeks. The decline from recent highs was notably swift, with the index sliding nearly 800 points in just seven sessions. This has become the longest losing streak since March 2025, as Nifty closed lower for six straight days — a strong signal of deepening bearish sentiment across sectors.The sharpest blow came from the Nifty IT pack, which slumped almost 8% during the week. The sell-off was sparked after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed an enormous $100,000 fee for fresh H-1B visa applications, a move that stirred significant concern for Indian IT firms. This announcement led to heavy unloading in leading tech counters as investor confidence soured. To make matters worse, Trump also announced a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical imports on Friday, adding further pressure on export-oriented segments such as pharma.On the technical front, Nifty broke below multiple crucial moving averages — the 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day EMAs — all of which have now turned lower. Additionally, the daily RSI slipped out of its upward channel and dropped beneath the 40 level, strengthening the case for continued downside momentum.Looking ahead, the critical cushion for Nifty lies in the 200-day EMA zone at 24,400–24,350, which now stands as the final line of support. A decisive breach below 24,350 could open the gates for a further slide toward 24,000. On the flip side, immediate resistance has shifted down to 24,850–24,900, a band that must be crossed for any meaningful rebound attempt.The banking gauge, Bank Nifty, too faced selling pressure last week, shedding nearly 2% and slipping below the 54,400 level. From its recent swing high of 55,835, the index has lost more than 1,400 points in just seven sessions, underscoring the pace of correction in banking names.On the weekly timeframe, the index has carved out a large bearish candle, signalling strong downward momentum and a change in near-term sentiment. From a technical perspective, Bank Nifty has broken under its 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day EMAs, all of which are now pointing lower — highlighting the weakening trend structure.Further compounding the bearish picture, the daily RSI is inching closer to the 40 zone and continues to trend downward. This indicates fading momentum and suggests that the index could struggle to stabilize unless overall market mood turns supportive. The setup clearly calls for caution in the banking basket.In terms of levels, the 200-day EMA around 53,800–53,700 is expected to act as a critical support zone. A decisive breakdown below 53,700 may accelerate the decline toward the 53,000 mark. On the other hand, immediate resistance has now shifted lower to 54,700–54,800, which will serve as a key barrier for any meaningful rebound.Larsen & Toubro (L&T) had repeatedly failed to cross the stiff resistance zone of 3700–3710 since early June, but today’s strong move, supported by rising volumes, has finally propelled the stock above this barrier, signalling a potential breakout. The price action is encouraging, as L&T has closed firmly above all key short- and long-term moving averages, showcasing a robust bullish structure.Bollinger Bands are widening with price action hugging the upper band, indicating strong momentum and the possibility of continuation. RSI has moved above 60, pointing to strengthening bullish sentiment. Volume activity has picked up, reinforcing conviction in the breakout. The ADX line too is rising, hinting at improving trend strength.Overall, with resistance now conquered, L&T looks poised for further upside. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 3730-3710 with a stoploss of Rs. 3600. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 4000 in the short term.Ashok Leyland, which is a constituent of the Auto Index, has relatively outperformed the Nifty index in recent weeks, as indicated by a rising ratio line in Ashok Leyland/Nifty ratio chart. Despite weakness in the broader markets, the stock has shown resilience, managing to hold its ground without cracking under selling pressure. On the daily chart,Ashok Leyland continues to trade above all key moving averages – the 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs – reflecting a strong bullish undertone.The price has been hugging along the upper band of the Bollinger Bands, signalling sustained buying interest and a phenomenon which is often seen during strong trends. RSI remains comfortably above 60, indicating healthy momentum without signs of overheating. Importantly, the ADX line is rising, highlighting strengthening trend intensity, which adds conviction to the ongoing move.With technicals aligned in favor of the bulls, the stock looks poised for further upside. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 140-142 with a stoploss of Rs. 137. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 151 in the short term.","The benchmark Nifty index recorded a steep fall of 2.65% over the past week.

PM E-DRIVE scheme: Govt issues new guidelines for EV charging stations; rollout to cover cities and highways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pm-e-drive-scheme-govt-issues-new-guidelines-for-ev-charging-stations-rollout-to-cover-cities-and-highways/articleshow/124197543.cms,"



The Centre has unveiled operational guidelines for the rollout of nearly 72,300 public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across the country, with an outlay of Rs 2,000 crore under the Rs 10,900 crore PM E-DRIVE scheme.According to the Ministry of Heavy Industries, the framework provides a tiered subsidy structure to accelerate the installation of charging infrastructure at government premises, highways, public transport hubs, and commercial complexes, PTI reported.As per the guidelines, government offices, residential colonies, hospitals, and educational institutions will be eligible for 100 per cent subsidy on upstream infrastructure and EV charging equipment, provided they ensure free public access.For high-traffic public locations such as railway stations, airports managed by the Airports Authority of India, bus terminals, metro stations, municipal parking lots, public sector ports, retail outlets of state-run oil companies, and toll plazas operated by NHAI or state governments, the subsidy will cover 80 per cent of upstream infrastructure costs and 70 per cent of charging equipment costs.Shopping malls, markets, and roadside facilities along highways and expressways will also qualify for an 80 per cent subsidy on upstream infrastructure.Similarly, battery swapping or charging stations set up at any location will be eligible for 80 per cent support on upstream costs.The ministry said eligible government agencies will appoint nodal bodies to aggregate demand, identify high-priority sites, and submit consolidated proposals through a dedicated portal. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) has been designated as the Project Implementation Agency (PIA) to oversee deployment.The subsidy will be disbursed in two tranches, linked to compliance and performance benchmarks. The scheme prioritises cities with populations above one million, state capitals, smart cities, metro-linked satellite towns, and high-density transport corridors. Public transport hubs including railway stations, airports, and fuel retail outlets are also earmarked for support.","The Centre has unveiled operational guidelines for the rollout of nearly 72,300 public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across the country.

"Groceries feed UPI growth, investment share dips",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/groceries-feed-upi-growth-investment-share-dips/articleshow/124202426.cms,"



Mumbai: Groceries and supermarkets, whose share of UPI transactions rose to 24.6% from 22.4% a year ago, have been the biggest gainers in share of UPI transactions in various merchant categories, while payments for securities broking and debt repayment saw a decline in market share compared with last year.The rise of groceries was driven by the surge in quick commerce platforms, where UPI has become the default mode of payment. Their value share also expanded from 8.3% to 9.4%, showing UPI's deeper penetration into household spending.Eating places and restaurants also saw robust growth, with transaction volumes up nearly 35% year-on-year. Together with fast-food outlets, they accounted for almost one-fifth of all UPI transactions by count, consolidating UPI's dominance in small-ticket discretionary spends. Pharmacies maintained their share at 2.5% but posted nearly 38% growth in absolute volume, aided by greater adoption of online medicine delivery apps.UPI transactions in Aug 2025 rose 36% year-on-year to 12.7 billion, while the value of payments grew 26% to Rs 7.24 lakh crore. Volumes grew faster than value, reflecting shrinking ticket sizes as consumers increasingly turned to UPI for small, everyday purchases.In contrast, securities brokers saw their value share slide from 10.2% in Aug 2024 to 6.3% in Aug 2025, with payments through UPI falling from Rs 58,000 crore to Rs 46,000 crore. The decline followed regulatory changes that required brokers to use UPI block-and-release mandates for secondary market trades and imposed restrictions on UPI use in F&O transactions, dampening flows.Debt collection agencies retained their position among the top categories by value, collecting Rs 77,000 crore in Aug 2025 compared to Rs 69,000 crore a year earlier. However, their share in total UPI value dropped to 10.6% from 12% amid a slowdown in digital lending, which had spiked in the previous year. Telecom payments too lost share, slipping from 8.5% to 6.8% of volumes, as recharge growth plateaued.Fuel stations inched up their share of UPI value from 4.5% to 4.8%, supported by steady mobility demand. Meanwhile, the ""others"" category expanded sharply to 42.7% of value from 39% a year ago, underscoring UPI's growing use across diverse and uncategorised merchant segments.The data shows UPI's next leg of growth is being powered by daily-use categories like groceries, food, and medicines, while investment-linked payments and lending-related collections are adjusting to regulatory and market shifts.","UPI transactions in Aug 2025 rose 36% year-on-year to 12.7 billion, while the value of payments grew 26% to Rs 7.24 lakh crore.

"RBI cracks down on 'buy now, pay later'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-cracks-down-on-buy-now-pay-later/articleshow/124202397.cms,"



MUMBAI/BENGALURU: RBI has ordered Simpl, a Bengaluru-based buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) firm, to shut its payments operations with immediate effect.The platform, which works with 26,000 merchants and lets shoppers defer payments at checkout, had been running a payments system without the central bank's blessing. Under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act of 2007, no company can operate such a system without explicit authorisation.The order is the latest salvo in the RBI's campaign to tame the fast-growing world of digital credit. BNPL schemes have proliferated in recent years, enticing consumers with instant credit lines and merchants with seamless sales. According to industry sources, the regulator's concerns are around unsecured lending, weak oversight and poor consumer safeguards. In 2022 the RBI stopped BNPL firms from topping up prepaid payment instruments with borrowed money-a ruling that pushed them closer to the digital-lending rulebook.Simpl's fate echoes another crackdown last year, when card networks were rapped for running business-to-business payment flows through third parties lacking approval. In both cases the offence was the same: conducting clearing and settlement without a licence.The difference is that the card networks case concerned corporate card flows, whereas Simpl's involves consumer credit and payment aggregation. The RBI's message is plain: whether card-based or BNPL, all digital payment systems fall under its writ.Simpl, operated by One Sigma Technologies, had earlier come under Enforcement Directorate (ED) glare for alleged violations of India's foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign exchange rules. The allegation is that the company received Rs 913 crore by classifying its business as IT services, which qualifies for 100% automatic FDI approval. However, the agency determined that Simpl's actual business model was financial services, requiring prior government approval which it did not obtain.A senior Simpl executive explained the firm's approach, saying ""we use our own money against our own collateral, no public money is involved. If a customer defaults, the loss is ours."" The person added that Simpl does not charge interest. ""We earn a merchant fee and levy a flat late fee, so customers don't enter an interest spiral,"" he told TOI anonymously.","RBI has ordered Simpl, a Bengaluru-based buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) firm, to shut its payments operations with immediate effect.

RBI's next move? Panel likely to hold rates steady this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbis-next-move-panel-likely-to-hold-rates-steady-this-week/articleshow/124202388.cms,"



MUMBAI: RBI is expected to keep policy rates unchanged in its three-day monetary policy committee meet that starts on Monday.Most economists cite resilient growth, benign inflation and external uncertainties as reasons for a pause, even as the tone of RBI's guidance is likely to be more dovish than the action itself. Some economists, however, see scope for a 25-basis-point (100bps =1 percentage point) cut as inflation could dip below target.The Oct decision is seen as trickier than Aug, with global and domestic forces pulling in opposite directions. Bond market volatility and a weakening rupee add to the challenge. ""The upcoming RBI MPC decision could be a closer call compared to the last MPC meeting,"" said Prasanna A of ICICI Securities Primary Dealership. ""While we see 35-40% probability of a rate cut, our base case view still remains a pause even as accompanying commentary could tilt the outcome towards a dovish pause. ""SBI, in a report, argued for a cut, calling it ""the best possible option given the benign inflation trajectory"" and said that not cutting rates and retaining a neutral stance would amount to a 'type 2 error'. RBI cut the repo by 50bps to 5.5% on June 6, the third cut this year - totalling 100bps since Feb.Nomura also expects early easing. ""We expect the RBI's MPC to be forward-looking, especially given the lags in policy transmission,"" said Sonal Varma of Nomura. ""Our expectation is of 25bps cuts in each of Oct and Dec to a terminal rate of 5% by end-FY26.""Domestically, strong GDP numbers, gradual inflation pick-up and currency pressures argue for a hold. ""Against the backdrop of firm growth of over 6.5%, fiscal levers being tapped to boost demand, inflation heading up gradually and the rupee under pressure, we expect the repo rate to be left unchanged,"" said Mandar Pitale of SBM Bank (India). ""However, cognizant of fresh tariff salvos from the US and risks to growth, we assign a 30% probability for a cut if RBI sees reason in front-loading action. ""The US Fed has resumed rate cuts, while India faces higher tariffs and potential secondary sanctions. ""We believe high reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US on India and additional secondary sanctions that could subtract growth by up to 1% on an annualised basis is more important information even as trade talks are ongoing,"" Prasanna said. RBI may also wait for its earlier steps, such as the Aug CRR (cash reserve ratio) cut, to take effect. ""Taking into consideration the overall tone of the minutes of Aug MPC indicating low probability of a rate cut in Oct, MPC is expected to maintain status quo,"" said Taimur Baig of DBS Group.","RBI is expected to keep policy rates unchanged in its three-day monetary policy committee meet that starts on Monday. Most economists cite resilient growth, benign inflation and external uncertainties as reasons for a pause. Some economists, however, see scope for a 25-basis-point cut as inflation could dip below target.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124202391,imgsize-1132565,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India's celebrity brand landscape is undergoing a decisive shift, with female stars shining in star power. Women strengthened their position among the country's 25 most powerful celebrities, with their collective brand value surging nearly 29% year-on-year to $594 million in 2024. In comparison, male celebrities witnessed only a 2% rise, reaching $1,436 million, data culled from Kroll's Celebrity Valuation Report said.Though men still dominate in absolute terms, the sharper growth curve for women signals clear momentum, as female stars increasingly outshine their male counterparts in brand value growth. The shift is reinforced by the endorsement activity. Female celebrities in the Top 25 expanded their brand associations from 198 in 2023 to 274 in 2024, far outpacing men, whose tally moved only marginally from 435 to 445.

MOSCOW/LONDON: Opec+ will likely approve another oil production increase of at least 137,000 barrels per day at its meeting next Sunday, as rising oil prices encourage the group to try to further regain market share, three sources familiar with the talks said.Opec+ has reversed its strategy of output cuts from April and has already raised quotas by more than 2.5 million barrels per day, representing about 2.4% of world demand, to boost market share and after coming under pressure from US President Donald Trump to lower oil prices.Eight Opec+ countries will hold an online meeting on Oct 5 to decide on Nov output.

Rajnath Singh Hails India’s New Stealth Frigates, Calls Them ‘F-35 On Water’ In Naval Power Push





India is aiming for a ""Maruti moment"" in shipbuilding, seeking to replicate the success of Maruti Suzuki ’s 1980s automobile revolution. The government announced a Rs 70,000-crore ($8 billion) package to revitalize domestic shipyards, boost India’s maritime ecosystem, and reduce the country’s heavy reliance on foreign vessels, which currently handle about 95% of its import-export trade.The plan includes a maritime development fund, a revamped shipbuilding assistance scheme, and incentives for South Korean and Japanese shipbuilders to establish operations in India, either independently or in partnership with local shipyards.The move aims not only to attract global investment but also to reduce India's dependence on foreign ships, and strengthen long-term maritime security.""With this new package, it's like the Maruti moment for shipbuilding,"" TK Ramachandran , secretary at the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways told ET.""But we have to create major domestic demand for ships to make these incentives work,"" Ramachandran added.India currently spends around $75 billion annually on hiring foreign ships—a figure that could surge to $400 billion by 2047 if domestic shipbuilding capacity is not expanded.Highlighting the strategic importance of the initiative, M Angamuthu, Chairperson of Mumbai Port Authority, said India’s reliance on foreign vessels leaves the nation vulnerable during global disruptions such as pandemics, wars, or sanctions.""A robust Indian fleet is essential to ensure continuity and sovereign control over the country’s critical supply chains,"" he added.Currently, India owns just 1,500 ships, with only 220 operating overseas for EXIM trade. The country has barely a dozen shipyards capable of building ocean-going vessels, producing less than 1% of global shipbuilding, compared with China’s 70% share, followed by South Korea and Japan.Ramachandran noted that the government has been in talks with several Korean and Japanese shipbuilders, many of whom are currently operating at full capacity.""They are choker-blocked with orders until 2028 or even 2029, so they are seeking alternative locations to build ships. With this incentive package, India is well positioned to attract them,"" he added.Notable Korean shipbuilders include Samsung Heavy Industries, Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hanwha Ocean, and HD Korea Shipbuilding, while prominent Japanese firms such as Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and Kawasaki are also active in global shipbuilding.","The government announced a Rs 70,000-crore ($8 billion) package to revitalize domestic shipyards.

Russia COOKS West In Fiery Showdown Over Iran Sanctions; Lavrov, Aide Vs E3 | Saudi Also Jumps In

What the sanctions cover?

An arms embargo banning the sale or transfer of conventional weapons to Iran.

Prohibition on imports, exports, or transfers of technologies connected to nuclear and missile programs.

Freezing of assets abroad belonging to individuals or groups tied to prohibited activities.

Travel bans for designated individuals.

Restrictions on access to banking and financial systems that could aid Tehran’s nuclear or missile ambitions.

What happens if sanctions are violated?

How the 'Snapback' works?

Iran rejects sanctions as “illegal”

Western powers call for dialogue





A wide range of UN sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program, previously lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, were reimposed late Saturday after Britain, France, and Germany triggered the agreement’s “snapback” mechanism, accusing Tehran of failing to meet its commitments.The sanctions, which directly target Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, come at a tense moment following the collapse of negotiations with Western powers and recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities by the United States and Israel.The restored sanctions place sweeping restrictions on Iran’s economy. They target companies, individuals, and organizations linked to nuclear or missile development, prohibiting the supply of equipment, expertise, or financial support.The key measures include:Any violation of the UN sanctions could trigger worldwide asset freezes. Alongside the UN measures, the European Union is expected to revive its own sanctions that were suspended under the 2015 accord. Their goal is not only to curb Iran’s nuclear activities but also to put financial pressure on Tehran to return to compliance, AFP reported.The United States already enforces its own tough sanctions.Since President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal during his first term, Washington has prohibited other nations from buying Iranian oil—crippling one of Tehran’s key revenue streams.The “snapback” mechanism restores earlier UN resolutions that were lifted under the nuclear deal. However, practical enforcement depends on member states updating their national laws.While the sanctions are legally binding, implementation is uneven. Some nations, including China, have continued trading with Iran despite US sanctions. Western officials expect Russia to ignore the snapback as well, leaving uncertainty over Beijing’s response, given its reliance on Iranian oil.Iran has strongly condemned the reimposed sanctions, calling them “unjustifiable” and “legally baseless.”“The reactivation of annulled resolutions is legally baseless and unjustifiable… all countries must refrain from recognising this illegal situation,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement.Tehran vowed to defend its interests, warning that “any action aimed at undermining the rights and interests of its people will face a firm and appropriate response.”Despite the reimposition, Western leaders insisted that channels for diplomacy remain open. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged Tehran to return to talks, saying, “Accept direct talks, held in good faith.”He also pressed UN members to implement sanctions immediately to “pressure Iran’s leaders to do what is right for their nation, and best for the safety of the world.”In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Germany reiterated their commitment to pursuing a new diplomatic solution, AFP reported.“We will continue to seek a new diplomatic solution to ensure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon,” they said, urging Tehran to avoid escalation. The reinstatement of sanctions marks the collapse of months of delicate diplomacy since negotiations broke down in June.","Britain, France, and Germany reimposed UN sanctions on Iran late Saturday.

‘Betrayal’: Iran Slams Europe Over Snapback Sanctions Ahead Of Crucial UN Security Council Clash





The United Nations has reimposed wide-ranging sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme, further tightening the squeeze on the Islamic Republic as it grapples with soaring food prices, currency collapse and fears of renewed conflict with Israel and the United States.According to news agency Associated Press (AP), the sanctions—revived through a “snapback” mechanism from the 2015 nuclear accord—took effect early Sunday.They will freeze Iranian assets abroad, block arms deals, and penalise Tehran’s ballistic missile development.France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered the snapback after accusing Iran of restricting monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency and failing to account for its growing stockpile of highly enriched uranium.Iran has long maintained its programme is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA believe it had organised weapons work until 2003. As per AP, Iran still holds uranium enriched up to 60% purity, close to weapons-grade levels, enough to produce several bombs should it decide to pursue weaponisation.The economic toll is already severe. The rial hit record lows, pushing up prices of staples like rice and meat.Inflation officially stands at 34.5%, with food costs up more than 50%.“Every day I see new higher prices for cheese, milk and butter. I cannot omit them like fruits and meat because my kids are too young to be deprived,” said Tehran resident Sima Taghavi, as cited by AP.Another, identified only as Sina, described conditions as worse than during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, “For my generation, it’s always either too late or too early—our dreams are slipping away.”The measures mark the first time in a decade that UN sanctions have returned. US secretary of state Marco Rubio urged Iran to “accept direct talks, held in good faith,” while Britain, France and Germany said they remain open to diplomacy.Germany’s foreign minister Johann Wadephul told the UN General Assembly that “Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon,” stressing sanctions were triggered due to Tehran’s non-compliance.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian rejected US proposals to surrender enriched uranium for limited reprieve, calling them unacceptable. Tehran recalled its envoys from Britain, France and Germany in protest.Russia, however, said it would not enforce the sanctions, with foreign minister Sergey Lavrov describing them as “blackmail and pressure.”Meanwhile, fears of escalation loom. As per AP, missile sites destroyed during the 12-day war in June appear to be rebuilt, raising risks of renewed clashes.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the UN that sanctions should not be delayed and signalled Israel could take further military action.As per AFP, Iranians are rushing to buy gold as the rial plunged to 1.12 million to the dollar on the black market. One engineer, Dariush, was quoted by AFP as saying, “The impact of the renewed sanctions is already evident: the exchange rate is increasing, and this is leading to higher prices. Our standard of living is much lower than two or three years ago.”Human rights groups also warn of intensifying repression. Executions in 2025 have already surpassed 1,000, the highest since 1988, amid unrest over economic hardships and political demands.With sanctions back in force and diplomacy uncertain, the Iranian people face what one psychologist described to Hamshahri newspaper as a society “exhausted and unmotivated”—caught between international isolation, internal crackdowns, and fears of another war.","The United Nations has reimposed wide-ranging sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme.

Kurdistan oil exports: Iraq resumes supply after two-year halt; over $35 bn revenue lost during shutdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/kurdistan-oil-exports-iraq-resumes-supply-after-two-year-halt-over-35-bn-revenue-lost-during-shutdown/articleshow/124180465.cms,"



Iraq has restarted oil exports from its autonomous Kurdistan region, ending a suspension that lasted more than two years because of legal disputes and pipeline closures.Baghdad’s oil ministry confirmed on Saturday that crude is once again moving through the Iraq-Turkey pipeline. The line, which had been closed since 2023, has been at the centre of long-running disagreements between the federal government and Kurdish authorities in Arbil over who controls the region’s oil wealth.The State Oil Marketing Organisation (SOMO) will now handle 190,000 barrels per day for export and allocate a further 50,000 barrels for local consumption, its director Ali Nizar told AFP. Turkish energy minister Alparslan Batraktar also announced on X that flows through the pipeline had begun again on Saturday morning.Previously, Kurdish officials sold oil abroad without Baghdad’s approval, mainly through Turkey’s Ceyhan port. That practice was halted in March 2023 after the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris ruled the exports illegal and confirmed that only Iraq’s federal government could market the country’s crude.A breakthrough came in July, when Baghdad and Arbil agreed that all oil from Kurdistan’s fields would be transferred to SOMO.Another deal, signed on Thursday with international oil companies, cleared the final hurdle for exports to restart.US secretary of state Marco Rubio welcomed the move, saying Washington had “facilitated” the agreement and that it would “strengthen the mutually beneficial economic partnership between the United States and Iraq”.The stoppage has been costly. The Association of the Petroleum Industry of Kurdistan (APIKUR) estimates Iraq lost more than $35 billion in revenue during the shutdown. Eight oil companies operating in Kurdistan have now signed on to resume exports, though they also want talks with Kurdish authorities within 30 days to address more than $1 billion in unpaid expenses.Norwegian operator DNO ASA has opted out, insisting that resuming exports should only happen “pursuant to agreements that ensure payment surety”.Oil is Iraq’s economic backbone, making up about 90% of state revenue. The country, a founding member of OPEC, currently exports 3.4 million barrels per day, according to SOMO figures reported by the INA news agency.","Iraq has restarted oil exports from its autonomous Kurdistan region.

What will be the impact if tariff gets imposed?







The Donald Trump-led US administration is considering a plan to impose tariffs on imported electronic devices depending on the number of chips in each one of them, Reuters reported, citing three sourcesUnder the proposal, the US commerce department would calculate tariffs as a percentage of the product’s estimated chip value, in a move designed to push manufacturers to shift production to America.""America cannot be reliant on foreign imports for the semiconductor products that are essential for our national and economic security,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told Reuters, regarding the matter.""The Trump administration is implementing a nuanced, multi-faceted approach to reshoring critical manufacturing back to the United States with tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and energy abundance,"" Desai added.Uncertainty remains about the scope of products that would be affected, tariff rates, and possible exemptions.The commerce department was weighing a 25% rate on chip content, and 15% for electronics from Japan and the EU, though figures were still preliminary, a source told the agency.If implemented, the policy would apply to a broad range of consumer goods, from toothbrushes to laptops, potentially raising costs for US households.Economists warned it could also worsen inflation. According to Michael Strain, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, the move would push up consumer prices ""at a time when the US has an inflationary problem, with inflation clearly above the Fed's target and accelerating.""He added that even domestically produced goods could get costlier due to higher tariffs on imported inputs.Trump has already rolled out sweeping tariffs this year, including 100% duties on branded drugs and 25% on heavy-duty trucks. Earlier in April, his administration launched probes into pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, calling foreign reliance a national security threat.A potential exemption linked to investments in US manufacturing, dollar-for-dollar credits only if a company shifts half its production to America, has been discussed but not finalised.Meanwhile, earlier proposals to exempt chipmaking tools faced pushback from the White House, with sources saying Trump dislikes carve-outs.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Trump Political Vendetta? After Ex-FBI Comey, Trump Names His Next Target





US President Donald Trump on Friday publicly demanded that Microsoft dismiss Lisa Monaco, the company’s president of global affairs and a former top official in Democratic administrations.In a lengthy Truth Social post, Trump claimed ‘corrupt and totally Trump deranged’ Monaco posed risks to national security because of her past government roles. “She is a menace to US National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government,” Trump wrote.“Because of Monaco’s many wrongful acts, the US Government recently stripped her of all Security Clearances, took away all of her access to National Security Intelligence, and banned her from all Federal Properties.”Trump added that “it is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco.”According to news agency Reuters, Monaco began working at Microsoft in July, taking charge of the firm’s global engagement with governments. Her LinkedIn profile confirms the appointment.She previously served as a national security aide under Barack Obama , helped coordinate the justice department’s response to the January 6 Capitol attack, and was deputy attorney general during Joe Biden ’s administration.Trump linked his demand to Monaco’s role in the Biden justice department, which pursued legal cases against him. He argued that her senior position at Microsoft, with access to sensitive information, was “unacceptable.”The criticism comes after former FBI director James Comey, a longtime Trump adversary, was indicted on obstruction and perjury charges.Trump has said he expects “others” to face prosecution, according to Reuters.The attack on Monaco highlights Trump’s broader pattern of targeting perceived political enemies. Since returning to the White House in January, he has pushed for charges against several figures, including former national security adviser John Bolton and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff, and has exerted pressure on institutions ranging from law firms to universities.The president’s interventions have also extended into corporate America. His administration previously demanded the resignation of Intel’s chief executive, pressed Disney’s ABC over comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s show, and influenced decisions at other major firms.Meanwhile, Microsoft continues to navigate its relationship with the administration. Earlier this month, CEO Satya Nadella attended a White House dinner with Trump and other technology leaders.The company has also been under scrutiny for its contracts with US agencies and, separately, for restricting certain cloud services to a unit of the Israeli military following a review of alleged surveillance practices, reported CNBC.",US President Donald Trump publicly demanded that Microsoft dismiss Lisa Monaco.

Algo diplomacy: How Xi Jinping used TikTok to court Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-signs-tiktok-order-xi-jinping-bytedance-ltd-us-china-trade-deal/articleshow/124161748.cms,"AI image for representation only.

TL;DR: Driving the news

Big Win For Trump Amid Trade Faceoff With China, TikTok Algorithm Now Under American Oversight

Why it matters

The TikTok manoeuvre isn’t just about data privacy or algorithms. It’s about leverage the in ongoing US-China trade war.

Xi's quiet greenlight - not yet officially confirmed by Beijing - is part of a larger effort to reset US-China ties on China’s terms. And Trump, who once threatened to ban the app outright, now gets to tout himself as the man who saved TikTok and satisfied national security hawks.

As per a New York Times report, at its core, this is a story about how Xi Jinping turned a tech headache into a diplomatic lever, and how Donald Trump transformed a national security threat into a personal political win.

Interestingly, both leaders are using TikTok - a wildly popular app among American youth - to serve entirely different agendas:

For Xi: TikTok is no longer Beijing’s tech crown jewel. It’s a bargaining chip. China now sees more value in trading it for potential relief on US tariffs, export restrictions on AI chips, and diplomatic breathing room around Taiwan.

TikTok is no longer Beijing’s tech crown jewel. It’s a bargaining chip. China now sees more value in trading it for potential relief on US tariffs, export restrictions on AI chips, and diplomatic breathing room around Taiwan. For Trump: TikTok is a campaign lifeline. He credits it for helping him reach young voters in 2024 and boasts 15 million followers on the platform. Now, he gets to claim he “saved TikTok,” appeased security hawks, and secured a deal that looks tough on China - without actually banning the app.

TikTok is a campaign lifeline. He credits it for helping him reach young voters in 2024 and boasts 15 million followers on the platform. Now, he gets to claim he “saved TikTok,” appeased security hawks, and secured a deal that looks tough on China - without actually banning the app. The timing also matters:

Beijing is under pressure: With economic headwinds at home, mounting Western export controls, and a post-pandemic slowdown, China is recalibrating its tone with Washington.

The US is headed toward a tech decoupling cliff: The deal sets a precedent for how Chinese tech can (or can’t) operate inside the American ecosystem - especially around algorithms, user data, and influence risks.

Congress is watching: The deal's structure - a licensed algorithm, American-controlled board, Oracle oversight - could become a template or a cautionary tale.

""It’s not just about who owns the app,"" Jasmine Enberg of Emarketer told AP. ""It’s about who controls the algorithm, the data, and ultimately, the narrative.""

In short: This isn’t a tech transaction. It’s a calculated act of tech diplomacy - one that could shape the next phase of the US-China rivalry and redefine the limits of digital sovereignty.

The big picture

What’s in the deal:

ByteDance keeps under 20% ownership and one board seat in the new company, TikTok US.

Oracle and Silver Lake will lead the investor group, alongside Abu Dhabi’s MGX. Trump also name-checked Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch as investors.

Oracle gets algorithm oversight. The TikTok algorithm will be licensed from ByteDance, retrained solely on US data, and supervised by “trusted” American partners.

Data storage stays in Oracle’s cloud, with no ByteDance access to US user info.

Between the lines

What they are saying

“Young people really wanted this to happen,” Trump said.

He also admitted he would make TikTok “100% MAGA” if he could - though he insists the new app will be fair to “every philosophy.”

“There’s much bigger fish to fry,” Yun Sun, the director of the China program at the Stimson Center in Washington, told the NYT. “If China can use these small concessions to trade for a positive atmosphere, better US-China relations, they will want to do it,” she said, referring to TikTok.

""It’s not just about who owns the app,"" Jasmine Enberg of Emarketer. ""It’s about who controls the algorithm, the data, and ultimately, the narrative.

Bloomberg Opinion’s Catherine Thorbecke put it: “In China, ‘win-win’ means China wins twice.”

What’s next

The TikTok deal may be just Act I. Trump and Xi are expected to speak again soon - possibly setting up a summit next month during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.

Such a sit-down would mark their first in-person meeting since Trump returned to the White House - and could shape the next phase of global tech, trade, and military diplomacy.

Xi reportedly wants to host Trump in Beijing - both for symbolism and control. China is wary of another diplomatic misfire, like Ukraine’s Zelensky being publicly scolded at the White House.

Congressional review: Lawmakers are not convinced this setup truly complies with the 2024 law. Republican Rep. John Moolenaar says he plans to “discuss these issues with the transaction parties.”

Beijing’s final word: China must still issue a license for the algorithm’s export - a critical step that could derail or delay implementation.

Tech decoupling accelerates: Even if the TikTok deal succeeds, the broader push to sever strategic tech ties with China continues - from semiconductors to AI models.





President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday endorsing a $14 billion deal that would spin off TikTok’s US operations from its Chinese owner ByteDance. The move aims to meet the legal requirement set by a 2024 law forcing ByteDance to divest or face a ban in the US.But the headline-grabbing deal is more than a tech breakup. It’s a strategic olive branch from China - and President Xi Jinping appears to be playing a long game.“I had a very good talk with President Xi,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “We talked about TikTok and he gave us the go-ahead.”As the New York Times and Bloomberg have noted, China’s sudden acquiescence to a divestment it once labeled “robbery” has sparked questions about what’s being traded behind the scenes - and whether the most valuable export here isn’t TikTok’s algorithm, but goodwill from Beijing.The TikTok deal is part tech workaround, part geopolitical theater. On paper, it creates a US-based joint venture with a mostly American board and ownership structure. In reality, it’s a finely tuned diplomatic signal.JD Vance, Trump’s vice president, said the deal will put the new TikTok’s valuation at “roughly $14 billion” - a figure that Emarketer says aligns with its expected 2026 ad revenue.The algorithm - TikTok’s secret sauce - is at the center of the national security debate. While ByteDance keeps ownership, the new algorithm will be “rebuilt from the ground up” with Oracle's oversight, per US officials.“American investors will actually control the algorithm,” Vance emphasized.Still, skepticism remains: “Has ByteDance truly lost control?” asked Alan Rozenshtein of the University of Minnesota. “That’s far from clear.”Meanwhile, Beijing has been deliberately vague. No formal statement of approval. No confirmed export license. But state-run media described the deal as a “win-win,” and Xi’s silence suggests strategic consent - not surrender.(With inputs from agencies)","TikTok algorithm will be licensed from ByteDance, supervised by “trusted” American partners.

US stocks were trading in green on Friday, buoyed by a combination of factors including renewed hopes for more rate cuts and US President Donald Trump's announcing new tariffs, including a 100% import tax on foreign-made pharmaceutical drugs, starting next week.Dow Jones soared 369 points or 0.8% to reach 46,316 while Nasdaq jumped 71 points or 0.32%, trading at 22,455.S&P 500 also followed the trajectory, reaching 6,641, gaining 36 points or 0.56% at 7:20 PM IST.Investors were encouraged by a fresh inflation report, which suggested the Fed may have room to reduce rates further. Meanwhile, Trump’s new tariffs on pharmaceuticals, heavy trucks, and other imports created modest market reactions rather than major upheaval. US pharmaceutical companies rose slightly, while home-furnishing retailers slipped.Trump said on social media that foreign furniture and cabinetry makers were “flooding the United States” and tariffs were needed “for National Security and other reasons.” Shares of home-furnishing companies responded with losses: Wayfair and Williams-Sonoma fell nearly 3%, and RH dropped 5%.He also targeted foreign-made heavy trucks and parts, claiming they hurt US producers, though most trucks are either manufactured domestically or are US brands built in Canada or Mexico.Shares of Paccar, an American truck maker, jumped 6%.Dow component Boeing gained more than 3% after reports that federal safety regulators plan to ease oversight of the company.Investors are closely watching Friday’s US consumer spending data, which includes the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Stocks have faced pressure this week after reports suggested the US economy may be stronger than expected. While that is good news for workers and jobseekers, it could limit the Fed’s ability to cut rates multiple times in the coming months.The Fed delivered its first rate cut of the year last week and had signalled further reductions through next year, which has helped drive US stocks to record highs since April. Easier rates boost economic growth and encourage investors to pay higher prices for stocks and other assets. The Fed will consider Friday’s inflation figures and labour market data when deciding its next move in late October.","Dow Jones soared 369 points or 0.8% to reach 46,316.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Startups will play important role in helping India become 3rd largest economy: CEA Nageswaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/startups-will-play-important-role-in-helping-india-become-3rd-largest-economy-cea-nageswaran/articleshow/105332523.cms,"Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Startups will play an important role in helping India become the third largest economy in the world, Chief Economic Advisor ( CEA ) to the Union government V Anantha Nageswaran has said.Nageswaran said that tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country due to improvements in infrastructure and supportive policies of the government, according to a KSUM release.The CEA, during his Leadership Talk on the concluding day of the Huddle Global 2023 organised by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), said that India was the fifth largest economy on course to become the third largest in a few years.""In fact, I will say 7-in-7 is the buzz slogan, that is 7 trillion USD economy in seven years. Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.Udaan built an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

How India's GDP has been growing

What SBI report said on savings and investment

Incremental capital output ratio

NEW DELHI: India's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the third quarter (October-December 2022) received a word of caution from the former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan In an interview with news agency PTI, Rajan that India is ""dangerously close"" to the Hindu rate of growth in view of subdued private sector investment, high interest rates and slowing global growth.India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.Rajan termed this sequential slowdown in growth as ""worrying"".However, a report released by the State Bank of India (SBI) economists on Tuesday dismissed arguments that India is dangerously close to Hindu rate of growth saying such statements are ""ill-conceived, biased and premature"".The term 'Hindu growth rate' was coined by late economist Raj Krishna in 1978 to describe the slow growth in the country.It basically refers to the low pace of economic growth rates during 1950s to 1980s. During this period, the Indian economy averaged 3.5%.A former lecturer at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), Krishna noted that only if the rate of growth is persistently slow and accompanied by low per-capita GDP, then it will be known as Hindu rate of growth but it has to factor in population growth as well.Before economic reforms of 1991, India's economic growth remained stagnant and low, while per capita income averaged around 1.3%. Krishna termed this low growth situation to be a result of socialist policies of state control and import substitution.However, the economic situation changed when liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) reforms came into effect in the year 1991, at a time when India faced balance of payment crisis.Over the years, many economists have strongly opposed the idea of 'Hindu growth rate' and the term never had universal acceptance.The Indian economy plunged into its very first technical recession in FY21 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and the related nationwide lockdowns. GDP shrunk by an unprecedented 23.8% in the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21. However, due to spurt in economic activities in the subsequent quarters, the GDP decline started to narrow.However, if we look at the period before Covid-19 as well, India's growth curve shows a declining trend.From 8.26% in FY17, GDP growth plunged to 3.74% in FY20. Shutdown of economic activities in FY21 in wake of Covid-19 only made matters worse.As lockdowns started to ease and business activities resumed, India's GDP also started rising. In Q1 of FY22, growth jumped to 20.1% mainly on account of low base effect. By the fourth quarter of FY22, growth came down to 4.10%.Similarly, the new financial year 2022-23 brought fresh economic challenges in the form of Russia-Ukraine war that impacted almost all major economies of the world, slowed the pace of growth, pushed inflation to record highs.As a result, the central banks of all advanced economies spurred into action and opted for monetary policy tightening to curb the soaring inflation.With persistently rising interest rates, India's economy grew by 4.4% in Q3 of FY23, as the Centre revised upwards GDP growth for previous year to 9.10% from 8.7% earlier.The report weighed recent GDP numbers against the available data on savings and investments for the past decade and highlighted some interesting points.""Quarterly growth numbers are noisy and should be best avoided for any serious interpretation (on an average, India's GDP growth has witnessed Rs 2 lakh crore upward revision for the 3 year ended FY23),"" the report said.Gross capital formation (GCF) by the government touched a high of 11.8% in 2021-22, up from 10.7% in 2020-21.""This also had a domino effect on private sector investment that jumped from 10 per cent to 10.8% over the same period,"" it said.In fact, Ecowrap added that the trends in GCF to gross output ratio or the plough back of funds for creation of fresh capacity shows that for public administration the ratio attained fresh peak in 2021-22 owing to the emphasis on capital expenditure in recent budgets.At the aggregate level, gross capital formation is supposed to have crossed 32% in 2022-23, the highest level since 2018-19.According to the report, in 2021-22, gross savings have risen to 30% from 29% in 2020-21.""The ratio is supposed to have crossed 31 per cent in 2022-23, the highest since 2018-19. The household savings increased sharply during the pandemic period on account of sharp accretion in financial savings such as deposits,"" said the report by SBI's Economic Research Department.While household financial savings have since then moderated from 15.4% in 2020-21 to 11.1% in 2022-23, savings in physical assets have grown sharply to 11.8% in 2021-22 from 10.7% in 2020-21.The report further analysed Incremental Capital Output ratio (ICOR) -- which measures additional units of capital (investment) needed to produce additional units of output. It said that the ratio has been improving.""ICOR which was 7.5 in FY 12 is now only 3.5 in FY22. Clearly, only half of capital is now needed for next unit of output,"" the report noted.Such reducing ICOR in the current years reflects a relatively increasing efficiency of capital and shows that the economy is on a sound footing, the report said.""From that point of view, future GDP growth rates even at 7% could still mean a decent number by any standards!,"" it added.","India's GDP for Q3 slowed to 4.4% from 6.3% in the previous quarter. For Q1, Indian economy grew by 13.2%.

An employee is entitled for a 50 per cent amount of the last drawn salary as pension.OPS was discontinued by the NDA government in 2003 with effect from April 1, 2004.Under the new pension scheme (NPS), employees contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary towards pension while the government contributes 14 per cent.Governments of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have informed the central government/ Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA about their decision to restart OPS for their employees.The government of Punjab on November 18, 2022, issued a notification regarding implementation of OPS for the state government employees who are being covered under NPS. Jharkhand too has decided to revert to OPS.",Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has expressed his concern over the decision of some states to restart the old pension scheme.

All the state governments were asked to open procurement centres for coarse grains in producing districts, especially, in tribal areas. State governments were asked to encourage consumption of coarse grains as well.The conference also deliberated on fighting anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in various parts of the country by suitably creating awareness on benefits of fortified rice.The issues related to smart Public Distribution System (PDS) and One Nation One Ration Card scheme for seamless delivery of foodgrains to migrant beneficiaries were also discussed.FCI (Food Corporation of India) is the government's nodal agency that undertakes procurement and distribution of foodgrains for the PDS and welfare schemes.The best practice of command control centre by Andhra Pradesh for real time data on procurement, storage, quality and distribution of foodgrains was also discussed, for which all states have been urged to learn and adopt the methods to make their systems effective and efficient.Further, implementation of additional minimum threshold parameters for online procurement operations, i.e. integration of power validation of milled rice quantity with electricity consumption and tracking of vehicles used for transporting food grains were also deliberated upon for improving efficiency and transparency in procurement operations.During the discussion, it emerged that sufficient jute bags are available as per requirement of ensuing season.

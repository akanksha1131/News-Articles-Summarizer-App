"Thanksgiving 2025: Retailers Closed, Record Travel Forecast, and Black Friday Openings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/thanksgiving-2025-retailers-closed-record-travel-forecast-and-black-friday-openings/articleshow/125596266.cms,"Retail, banks and deliveries halted for the holiday

AAA projects 81.8 million Thanksgiving travellers

Americans are set for a mix of family meals and early holiday shopping this week, with most big retailers staying shut on Thanksgiving before reopening at dawn for Black Friday, the unofficial start of the Christmas buying rush. The week also marks what AAA says will be the busiest Thanksgiving travel period on record, according to AP report.Most national retailers — including Walmart, Target, Macy’s, Kohl’s and Costco — will remain closed on Thursday, returning with early openings from 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. on Black Friday. CVS will shut early, and Walgreens will close most stores except select 24-hour locations. Grocery chains will open but many will close ahead of schedule, with timings varying by area.Government offices, post offices, courts and schools will be closed. US banks and stock markets will also shut for the day, reopening on Friday for a shortened trading session that ends at 1 p.m. Eastern. Standard FedEx and UPS pickup and delivery services will not operate on Thursday, though limited critical services will be available at certain locations.With schools closed and a long weekend ahead, travel is expected to surge.AAA estimates that 81.8 million people will journey at least 50 miles between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1 — 1.6 million more than last year and a potential new record. Nearly 73 million will travel by car, aided by petrol prices holding near $3 a gallon, slightly below last Thanksgiving’s average.About 6 million Americans are expected to fly domestically, a 2% rise from 2024, though cancellations or delays could shift the final count. Another 2.5 million travellers will rely on buses, trains or cruise ships, marking an 8.5% increase from last year.For many households, Thursday offers a quiet holiday — before the weekend turns into one of the year’s busiest on the roads, at airports and at shop entrances.","AAA projects 81.8 million Thanksgiving travellers.

"Labour reform: New codes to lift consumption by Rs 75,000 crore; SBI sees sharper formalisation ahead",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/labour-reform-new-codes-to-lift-consumption-by-rs-75000-crore-sbi-sees-sharper-formalisation-ahead/articleshow/125570043.cms,"Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

Implementation of the new labour codes is expected to deliver a Rs 75,000-crore consumption boost and raise the share of the formal workforce by at least 15 per cent, according to a research note by economists at SBI on Tuesday.The four codes, enforced from November 21, will also expand social security coverage to up to 85 per cent within the next three years and help reduce the unemployment rate by 1.3 per cent over the medium term, the note said, PTI reported.“With a saving rate of approx 30 per cent, the implementation will result in a consumption boost Rs 66 per person per day post-implementation. This could lead to an approx consumption boost of Rs 75,000 crore,” the SBI economists said.They added that the new framework will empower both workers and enterprises, creating a labour market that is “protected, productive and aligned with the evolving world of work.”SBI economists said India has around 44 crore unorganised workers, of whom 31 crore are registered on the e-Shram portal.Assuming 20 per cent of these workers transition into the formal payroll system, nearly 10 crore people would benefit — pushing social security coverage to 80–85 per cent in the next two to three years.Citing the Periodic Labour Force Survey, the note said 60.4 per cent of India’s workforce is currently formal. The bank expects formalisation to rise by 15.1 per cent under the new regime.The impact on unemployment will depend on “reform implementation, firm-level adjustment costs, and complementary state-level rules,” the report said.","The four codes, enforced from November 21, will expand social security coverage to up to 85 per cent within the next three years.

Investment: Rs 7,280 crore

Creating capacity of 6 thousand Metric Tons Per Annum (MTPA)

5 units of 1,200 MTPA capacity to be set up

Scheme duration: 7 years including 2 years for setting up manufacturing unit

India bets on Atmanirbharta for rare earths! In a boost to India's domestic rare earth manufacturing capabilities, PM Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet on Wednesday cleared an over Rs 7,200 crore Rare Earth Permanent Magnets (REPM) Scheme. The scheme aims to establish integrated manufacturing facilities with a capacity of 6,000 Metric Tons per Annum (MTPA) of Rare Earth Permanent Magnets. The initiative hopes to strengthen India's self-sufficiency and global market presence.REPMs, believed to be amongst the most powerful permanent magnets available, serve as essential components in various sectors including electric vehicles, renewable energy, electronics, aerospace and defence industries. Currently dependent on imports for REPM needs, this initiative marks India's first integrated REPM manufacturing facilities, creating jobs, enhancing self-sufficiency and supporting the country's Net Zero target by 2070. The scheme includes Rs 6,450 crore as sales-linked incentives for REPM sales over five years, alongside Rs 750 crore capital subsidy for establishing 6,000 MTPA of REPM production facilities.Announcing the decision, Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stressed on the strategic importance of the initiative ,which is a first-of-its kind. “This is a very important, strategic decision,” he said. According to Vaishnaw India has one of the largest rare earth deposits in the world.At present, India remains significantly dependent on imports of rare-earth permanent magnets, with China being the main source. The scheme is part of India’s comprehensive strategy to establish secure supply chains for essential minerals whilst developing domestic technological capabilities in emerging industrial domains.The approved scheme will facilitate the development of comprehensive REPM manufacturing units that will oversee the entire process from converting rare earth oxides into metals, transforming metals into alloys, and finally producing finished REPMs.India expects a twofold increase in REPM consumption by 2030 compared to 2025, primarily due to higher demand from electric vehicles, renewable energy, industrial sectors and consumer electronics.Through a global competitive bidding procedure, the scheme plans to distribute the total capacity among five recipients. Each selected recipient will receive an allocation of up to 1,200 MTPA capacity.The scheme's implementation spans seven years from the award date, incorporating a two-year establishment period for integrated REPM manufacturing facilities, followed by five years dedicated to disbursing incentives for REPM sales.The scheme's focus on developing local REPM production expertise will ensure a secure supply chain for national industries and contribute towards achieving the country's Net Zero 2070 targets.","The scheme aims to establish integrated manufacturing facilities with a capacity of 6,000 Metric Tons per Annum (MTPA) of Rare Earth Permanent Magnets.

Vande Bharat Sleeper Trains

PM Modi Flags Off Four Vande Bharat Express Trains From Varanasi, Says ‘New India On Fast Track’

Vande Bharat Sleeper

What are the expected features of the Vande Bharat sleeper train?

The first prototype of the Vande Bharat sleeper train has 16 passenger coaches - this includes 11 AC 3 tier coaches, 4 AC 2 tier coaches, and one AC First class coach.

The new train is capable of running at 160 kmph (testing speed 180 kmph) making it a semi-high speed train. However, most stretches on the Indian Railways network do not allow for such high train speeds.

Taking inspiration from European trains, the Vande Bharat sleeper train will have cushioned berths with enhanced comfort. The upper berth access has been redesigned for easier climbing.

The new train will have special night lights, integrated announcement systems with visual displays, CCTVs, and modular pantry units.

The train will feature modern bio-vacuum toilets, similar to those is aircrafts. There will also be a toilet for disabled passengers, which will also have a baby care station. The AC First class will include shower facilities with hot water provision.

The Vande Bharat sleeper train is equipped with the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision system. Like the chair car versions, the sleeper variant makes use of regenerative braking technology for optimal energy usage.

The coaches have automatic interconnecting doors. The gangways are sealed completely to maintain clean air and effective temperature control.

Each coach has individual reading lights, charging points, refreshment tables, and GFRP panel interiors. The train doors open automatically at the designated station.

The train has a Centralised Coach Monitoring System. Emergency communication systems connect passengers with the driver.

India is also looking to manufacture its own bullet train

Train travel in India is a vibe, with Indian Railways transporting millions of passengers. With the launch of the Vande Bharat Express trains a few years ago, Indian Railways has aimed to change the face of train travel, and several more new train projects are expected to deliver in 2026. While Vande Bharat - a chair car train set - has attempted to transform the day travel experience, there is growing demand for better, faster and more comfortable trains for overnight travel.In this regard, the Vande Bharat sleeper train project - launched a few years ago in the hope of rolling out an experience more premium than the Rajdhani Express trains - may prove to be a game changer. Simultaneously, Amrit Bharat Express and NaMo Bharat trains are expected to make travel faster and more comfortable for the common man. India may also soon see its very own, indigenous bullet train Over 200 Vande Bharat sleeper trains are expected to be rolled out in the coming years as Indian Railways looks to revamp long-distance train travel. Three major projects are currently in the works: BEML is manufacturing 10 Vande Bharat sleeper train sets with the help of ICF; Indo-Russian joint venture Kinet has been tasked with rolling out 10 train sets; and a Titagarh-BHEL consortium will make 80 Vande Bharat sleeper trains.Additionally, ICF is also looking to roll out its own version of the Vande Bharat sleeper train soon.The first prototype of the Vande Bharat sleeper train project awarded to BEML was originally supposed to be ready in the first half of 2024. Several deadlines have since then been missed. Two prototype rakes have been manufactured by BEML. Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has said that the Vande Bharat sleeper train requires 'minor' retrofitting. He believes that they will be launched in December.Sharing details about the Vande Bharat sleeper train projects, Integral Coach Factory (ICF) GM U Subba Rao told TOI, “Initially, we have given orders for 10 trains to BEML. The first prototype came out a few months back. We wanted some upgradations and improvements in the train so the second rake has come to us with the changes.”“We have already given BEML the go ahead for the other eight trains. The Railway Board will take the call on whether the two rakes will be launched together. From here on, BEML may manufacture one train a month,” he said.ICF too is looking to manufacture its own variant of the Vande Bharat sleeper. “We are working on a 24 car rake, which will be one of the longest sleeper trains being produced in India. We are working on the designs. It is slightly different from what BEML has produced, because we are trying to increase the number of toilets since it’s a long-distance train,” U Subba Rao said.“We also plan to have a pantry car for food to be heated up and served, which is not available in the other version of Vande Bharat sleeper. So, the configuration is slightly different. We are also trying to improve upon the interiors…we are on the drawing board right now,” he added.So when does ICF plan to roll out its own version of the Vande Bharat sleeper train?“Major assemblies have been ordered. For example, the propulsion system has already been ordered, and other major assemblies like doors and brake systems, the tender is going to be floated anytime soon. Specifications have been kind of finalized. By December 2026 we are targeting that the prototype Vande Bharat sleeper rake should be ready,” he said.Meanwhile, Kinet recently unveiled the design of the First AC coach of the Vande Bharat sleeper train. The production is expected to begin at Indian Railways’ Latur factory soon.Even as it launches a premium long-distance train, Indian Railways is also looking to introduce more modern trains for the common man. Amrit Bharat trains, first launched in 2023-end will continue to be introduced in the coming years as well. ICF is already rolling out Amrit Bharat 2.0 trains with better comforts compared to the first prototypes.Amrit Bharat Express is a push-pull train with non-AC coaches with a mix of general and second-class sleeper coaches. With a faster acceleration and deceleration, thanks to its push-pull technology, the Amrit Bharat train has a maximum speed of 130 kmph. In the coming months an Amrit Bharat 3.0 train is expected to be rolled out with AC coaches as well.ICF GM U Subba Rao told TOI that there is an order for 100 Amrit Bharat trains. “We have got an order for 50 Amrit Bharat 2.0 trains and 50 more trains will be manufactured by RCF,” he said. “We have already produced 10-12 trains. Two rakes a month, we are producing right now,” he added.Talking about AC coaches for Amrit Bharat Express, he said, “We are trying to introduce the Amrit Bharat 3.0 train as well. We have been asked to make five of those trains. We are working on the designs of the AC coaches. In this financial year, maybe by March 2026, we are trying to introduce the first prototype.”“The features will be similar to Rajdhani Express trains, but also much better because we also worked on non-AC coaches and made them better than the regular non-AC coaches. It’s an ongoing, continuous process,” he added.Several other projects that Indian Railways is working on include NaMo Bharat trains for short-distance inter-city travel, India’s own indigenous bullet train, and a hydrogen train which is a technology demonstrator project. NaMo Bharat trains, already launched on some routes, are a metro-style variant of the Vande Bharat Express trains, capable of 130 kmph speed.“We have produced one NaMo Bharat train, one was produced by RCF, Both are, right now, already in service. The board has decided that RCF will produce the balance 50 trains. We have already done the designing, and the design was shared with RCF, and they also produced the same design, they will continue with the production,” said ICF GM.Indian Railways has also manufactured its, which is expected to be launched soon on the Jind and Sonipat route in Haryana under the Northern Railway. The new train will have speeds of up to 110 kmph.Talking about the hydrogen train Subba Rao told TOI, “Basically this was a technology demonstrator. We tried to demonstrate the Indian capability of producing a hydrogen train. We will run it for some time and then maybe the government of India will take a call (on whether more such trains should be manufactured).”“You know, hydrogen technology is totally new. It's at an initial stage all over the world. So we are working on it. I'm sure it'll be successful,” he said.and a project has been awarded to BEML, in collaboration with ICF for manufacturing two high-speed train sets. The train will be indigenously designed and manufactured.“High speed rail is being manufactured by BEML. We have given the order to BEML - ICF, NHRCL, and BEML are collaborating on that project. The preliminary designs are all ready. They are also finalizing the vendors for all the sub-assembles and all important components. Orders are also being placed,” Subba Rao shared.“The final designs will be done and once some components arrive the manufacturing of the prototype car body will start. By early 2027, the first train should be running,” he added.Talking about the India-specific features of the bullet train, the ICF GM said, “It will be an air-conditioned chair car train suited for Indian conditions. Tropicalization has to be done. That's why designing the train within India is very important, since we know the conditions much better. In Europe, it is very cold, so they had to concentrate more on heating systems, whereas in India it is quite hot. So we have to concentrate on the AC system. So that's one of the basic differences.”“The second difference is our country is quite dusty, so that aspect also has to be taken into account. The filters have to be much better so that the air quality inside the coach is acceptable,” he added.With Vande Bharat sleeper trains, newer versions of Amrit Bharat Express, NaMo Bharat, bullet trains, and hydrogen trains in the pipeline, passengers can hope for better travel experience in the coming years.","Vande Bharat sleeper train will have cushioned berths with enhanced comfort.

GURUGRAM: US EV giant Tesla on Wednesday said running cost on the electrics will be one of the lowest in the country, with hardly any need to take the car to service stations for four years because of over-the-air (OTA) tech updates and other remote care. The company was speaking about plans to expand retail and supercharger network in India.Sharad Agarwal, head of Tesla's India business, said the company remains confident on growth in India after beginning operations in July this year with retail of Model Y, which is imported.The company has opened its first 'all-in-one Tesla Experience Centre' in Gurugram, after it began operations with two experience (sales) centres in Mumbai and Delhi. Apart from sales, this will be the first facility to offer after-sales, deliveries, and supercharging. Agarwal said the company is now preparing to expand with a new super-charging centre at Gurugram, apart from two more in Mumbai.On retail, expansion is planned but Tesla did not talk about the cities, though it could move into south and west India for new stores.The EV-maker will take a graded approach for retail expansion, as it builds self-owned retail units unlike a third-party dealer-led model followed by the broader industry.The interesting part of Tesla's sales pitch is its low operating cost, not only led by EV-led savings but also because of near-negligible service costs.The company gives to customers no service schedule plans, with a general advice that cars do not need to be brought in for service ""for years"", until and unless there is a serious technical flaw or body damage.The tech-led cars generally manage their health through over-the-air updates - similarly to what is done by mobile phone companies - which help upgrade the technical aspects on the vehicles. Also, remote diagnostics ensure there is no need to visit the service centres.",US EV giant Tesla on Wednesday said running cost on the electrics will be one of the lowest in the country. There is hardly any need to take the car to service stations for four years because of over-the-air tech updates and other remote care.

There’s No Systemic Bias, Says Gupta After Recent Misses

MUMBAI: RBI deputy governor Poonam Gupta defended the central bank's inflation projections, saying there is ""no systematic bias"" in forecasts issued by the Monetary Policy Committee.Speaking at a workshop here on Wednesday, she said inflation forecasting is difficult everywhere, ""equally challenging in India, if not more so"", because of the high food weight in the CPI and price volatility. She stressed that monetary policy works with lags, so the MPC must publish forward-looking forecasts ""up to four quarters ahead"". Forecast errors, she noted, are inevitable and tend to rise during shocks or when projecting far into the future.Responding to market criticism, Gupta said internal analysis confirms the MPC's forecasts are unbiased: ""The deviation of inflation and growth forecasts does not have any systematic directional bias."" She outlined a four-pronged approach using models, historical trends, high-frequency indicators and expert judgment to capture turning points and emerging risks.She was speaking at a consultative workshop on Base Revision of Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Index of Industrial Production (IIP). RBI will also publish faster and broader economic data in the coming months, with the central bank preparing monthly balance of payments numbers and expanding disclosures on how companies raise funds across bank and non-bank channels.","RBI deputy governor Poonam Gupta defended the central bank's inflation projections.

Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Seoul, Taipei and Jakarta all traded higher. Wellington and Manila lagged.This upswing comes after markets stumbled earlier in the month over fears that the tech-driven surge of recent years had overheated, and returns from heavy AI investments would take time to materialise. For now, those concerns have been overshadowed by the prospect of lower borrowing costs, which are seen as a bigger support for a broader range of companies, including smaller caps.Bitcoin, which had slumped to a seven-month low just above $80,000 during the recent market turmoil, climbed back above $90,000 as risk appetite improved. The cryptocurrency remains well below its record high above $126,200 touched in early October.In corporate news, shares of Japan’s beer giant Asahi slipped after the company said it would delay its financial results due to a cyberattack that began in late September.The maker of Asahi Super Dry reported system troubles starting September 29, which disrupted its ability to receive orders and ship products. The company said the outage was caused by a ransomware attack.","Asian markets follow US gains with strong advances across major centres.

India registers its first smell trademark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-registers-its-first-smell-trademark/articleshow/125603025.cms,"An AI-generated image

In a landmark shift for intellectual property, India has accepted the world’s first scientifically represented olfactory trademark — a rose-like fragrance embedded in tyres by Japan’s Sumitomo Rubber.The landmark decision revolutionizes non-traditional intellectual property protection, setting a new benchmark which has surpassed developed economies like the US and EU, and paves the way for innovative branding among consumer firms, industry experts say.Further, the decision broadens the trademark regime in India, allowing brands to differentiate themselves not just through logos and jingles, but now through signature fragrances.The application, filed by Sumitomo Rubber in 2023, sought protection for a rose-like floral fragrance applied to tyres.India has overtaken developed nations and set a new global gold standard with the graphic representation of protecting scents as trademarks. ``The graphical representation of smell marks is first time captured in deciding the olfactory trademarks.This is a fusion of science and law to raise the standards for more authentic decisions than mere statements’’, Unnat P Pandit, the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, told TOI.``The trade mark in question satisfies the criteria laid down for registration under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, as it is clear, precise, self-contained, intelligible, objective and is represented graphically,’’ Pandit, said in a recent order accessed by TOI.The application was stuck at the Patent Office over the last few months due to the absence of a graphical representation which is a mandatory requirement under the Act.The Registry appointed senior IP practitioner Pravin Anand, managing partner of Anand and Anand, as amicus curiae, while Sumitomo was represented by Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. The graphical representation was prepared by IIT Allahabad.``Non-conventional trademarks represent the natural next stage in the evolution of brand identity. As markets develop, consumers form associations not only through visual cues but also through sound, movement, shape, and scent. For India, recognising these marks is important not simply to keep pace with global practice, but because it reflects the adaptability of our statutory framework ’’, Anand said.This decision demonstrates that Indian trademark law is capable of accommodating new and complex forms of brand identity when supported by rigorous scientific and legal evidence’’, he added.Typically, a trade mark law serves as an enabler of trade. On one hand, it enables businesses by protecting their goodwill in the graphically represented marks they adopt for various goods and services that they offer in the market. On the other hand, it prevents confusion among customers by prohibiting the registration of marks that are not distinctive and that cannot be represented graphically - two standards that are the cornerstone of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, the order says.","The landmark decision revolutionizes non-traditional intellectual property protection.

"Govt approves Rs 7,280 crore scheme for rare earth magnet manufacturing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-approves-rs-7280-crore-scheme-for-rare-earth-magnet-manufacturing/articleshow/125602770.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Govt on Wed-nesday cleared an incentive scheme with an outlay of Rs 7,280 crore for establishing domestic capacity for manufacturing 6,000 tonne of integrated rare earth magnets annually with the aim of breaking China's stranglehold over this vital input for a host of industries ranging from automobiles to aerospace and defence.Govt will allot the total manufacturing capacity to five beneficiaries through global competitive bidding. Each beneficiary will be allotted an annual capacity of up to 1,200 million tonne. This will come with sales-linked incentives of Rs 6,450 crore for five years and capital subsidy of Rs 750 crore for setting up manufacturing facilities.Announcing the cabinet decision, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the scheme was drawn along the lines of India's semiconductor mission. ""This will make India self-reliant in rare earth magnet manufacturing in the next three to four years... India is among the three countries having highest reserves of rare earth. It will be among the leading producers of permanent magnets in the coming years,"" he added.The scheme will be in place for seven years from the date of award, including a two-year gestation period for setting up the manufacturing facility and five years for incentive disbursement on the sale of magnets.China dominates 90% of the global supply chain for rare earth magnets, often described as a 'kill switch' as it gives Beijing a leverage against importing countries. This vulnerability was exposed in April when China slapped export controls on medium and heavy rare earth-related items, citing national security concerns. This led to major supply disruptions for user industries.Shipments to India were particularly affected, leading to production challenges for Indian automobile manufacturers.In late Oct, China began issuing some export licences to Indian companies but restrictions remain and concerns persist due to the geopolitical sensitivity involved in rare earth supplies. India is especially vulnerable due to its dependence on imports and rising demand on the back of an expanding market for consumer electronics, renewable energy and other industrial applications. India's consumption of these magnets is expected to double by 2030 from about 3,600 tonnes this fiscal.","Govt will allot the total manufacturing capacity to five beneficiaries through global competitive bidding.

"What do new labour codes mean for employees & employers? From minimum wages, gratuity benefits to appointment letters & layoff rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-do-new-labour-codes-mean-for-employees-employers-from-minimum-wages-gratuity-benefits-to-appointment-letters-layoff-rules-top-things-to-know/articleshow/125545231.cms,"The new codes aim to increase women's employment opportunities, ensure worker safety, extend social security benefits to gig workers. (AI image)



Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

These new labour codes will replace 29 existing labour laws. These codes are:

The Code on Wages, 2019

The Code on Social Security, 2020

The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020

The Industrial Relations Code, 2020

Result of Rationalizing Labour Laws

What should employees know about the new labour codes?

There will now be separate classifications for 'employee' and 'worker', with different benefits allocated to each category.

A 'worker' means someone who belongs to the 'workman' category from the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, including individuals who perform manual, unskilled, skilled, technical, operational, clerical, or supervisory duties.

It excludes those in 'supervisory', 'managerial', or 'administrative' positions. Whilst the earlier legislation primarily addressed industrial disputes and retrenchment, the current definition has expanded considerably.

Workers will receive specific entitlements, including overtime compensation and leave encashment, as per the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020. Regulations regarding working hours, annual leave, and standing orders apply specifically to 'workers'.

The codes bring in a unified 'wages' definition across all four sections. Earlier, multiple interpretations of 'wages' and 'salary' created difficulties in benefit calculations, which then resulted in inconsistencies and even legal disputes.

This 'wages' definition now applies to calculations for Gratuity, Employees' State Insurance, Leave Encashment, Overtime, Statutory Bonus, and other benefits. This standardisation aims to improve compliance through greater clarity.

Fixed term employees will get all benefits equal to permanent workers. This includes leave, medical, and social security. They will be eligible for gratuity after just one year, instead of the current five. Additionally, they will get equal wages as permanent staff, increasing income and protection.

To put it simply, gig workers and the unorganized sector will finally see social security benefits.

The new labour laws allow for companies that employ fewer than 300 workers to do layoffs and retrenchments without seeking prior governmental approval.

What are the key provisions of the new labour codes?

What do the new labour codes mean for employers?

Evaluate employment roles: Identify the employees who would qualify as ‘workers’ based on their substantial nature of work.

Identify the employees who would qualify as ‘workers’ based on their substantial nature of work. Assess the impact of the definition of ‘wages’ on employees’ salary structure: Review salary structure and benefits framework to comply with the new definition of ‘wages.’

Review salary structure and benefits framework to comply with the new definition of ‘wages.’ Analyze cost implications: Assess the financial impact of enhanced employee benefits on the organization.

Assess the financial impact of enhanced employee benefits on the organization. Reassess hiring models: Consider alternate hiring models in light of the provisions related to contract labour and fixed-term employment.

Consider alternate hiring models in light of the provisions related to contract labour and fixed-term employment. Align HR and Payroll policies: Ensure that HR and payroll processes comply with the labour codes and relevant state-specific regulations.

New labour codes 2025: The Narendra Modi government has introduced what experts are calling a significant reform in labour laws with the implementation of four comprehensive labour codes. These codes are effective November 21, 2025. The new labour codes impact both employers and employees. The new laws mean some big benefits for workers - universal minimum wages, gratuity benefits, social security coverage, provisions for women to do night shifts, recognition of gig economy workers, formal appointment letter requirement etc. However, some provisions also raise employment security issues.The new codes aim to increase women's employment opportunities, ensuring worker safety, extending social security benefits to gig workers, and guaranteeing timely wage payments, while establishing minimum wage standards.At the same time, the new codes provide businesses increased operational flexibility whilst maintaining regulatory certainty, particularly important given current global economic challenges. Outdated labour laws have in the past deterred foreign investment in India's manufacturing sector, with companies often favouring countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh for their production facilities.Government officials indicated that rules for the four codes - covering wages, industrial relations, social security, and occupational safety and health - would be implemented within 45 days.Following their notification by 2020, the actual implementation had remained pending. The government has now officially announced the implementation. Whilst the final implementation rules from central and state governments are awaited, they are anticipated to be released soon.As Arvind Panagariya, Chairman of 16th Finance Commission wrote in TOI, “The importance of the four codes lies in breaking the ice. For the first time since the launch of reforms, they have removed the first set of hurdles in the way of creating high productivity jobs in large numbers.”These consolidated labour codes aim to streamline the existing laws, enhance digital compliance, improve workforce management systems, and strengthen worker protection along with facilitating business operations.EY is of the view that the implementation of the labour codes is a significant and long-awaited initiative by the government. “These codes are poised to impact nearly every function within organizations, given the extensive changes they introduce,” it says.“However, it may also result in increased costs for organizations due to wider scope of the definition of wages. There are still ambiguities regarding coverage of different components of salary within the definition of wages (such as coverage of performance bonuses / one-off payments, etc.),” notes EY in a note on the new Labour codes.The new labour laws restrict contract labour usage in organisations' 'core activities', barring specific exceptions. Core activity includes the main purpose of establishment creation and includes essential operations necessary for such activities.Additionally, fixed-term employment has received formal recognition as a legitimate employment arrangement, but it is contingent upon some conditions and regulatory requirements.The regulations also authorise states to implement adaptable work arrangements. Certain states, including Haryana and Odisha, have incorporated flexible working provisions in their draft regulations, permitting organisations to implement four-day work schedules, notes EY.EY notes that the labour codes significantly affect various aspects of HR and payroll policies. “Certain provisions overlap with existing state-specific Shops and Establishments laws, which are not superseded by the labour codes, potentially leading to conflicts, especially concerning working hours, leave, and related issues,” it says.Organizations operating in multiple states may have to ensure compliance with both sets of laws in each jurisdiction. Additionally, since specific provisions apply only to 'workers,' organizations may need to implement different policies for various employee categories, it adds.The new labour legislation also authorises both the central and state governments to create and execute welfare programmes for platform workers, gig economy participants, and unorganised sector employees.This can include life insurance, disability protection, healthcare provisions, maternity support, retirement security and any associated benefits.For gig worker social security arrangements, platform aggregators are required to contribute between 1-2% of their yearly turnover to the social security fund. This is subject to 5% of the amount paid or payable by an aggregator to gig workers, to the social security fund.This is a change from the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, which had set this limit at 100 workers. According to EY, the move offers businesses greater workforce management flexibility to adapt to market conditions.Additionally, the regulations also introduce a 're-skilling' fund to support any laid off workers in acquiring new skills. “For every retrenched worker, the employer is required to contribute 15 days’ last drawn wages (or any other amount notified by the central government) to a fund to be called the worker re-skilling fund,” explains EY.According to EY, It is essential for organizations to thoroughly assess the implications of these changes and prepare for a smooth transition to ensure compliance and operational efficiency. It suggests the following for organizations:The effectiveness of the new labour laws will substantially be dependent on state-level implementation, workforce education, and robust compliance monitoring.","The Narendra Modi government has introduced what experts are calling a significant reform in labour laws. The new codes aim to increase women's employment opportunities, ensure worker safety, extend social security benefits to gig workers. The codes are effective November 21, 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125546141,imgsize-32136,width-400,resizemode-4/new-labour-codes.jpg"

Schools, Colleges Shut Due to Heavy Rain In Puducherry

CHENNAI: Due to incessant rainfall over the past three days, several residential areas in Thoothukudi district have been inundated with water on Tuesday, disrupting daily life.Similarly, heavy rain in Nagapattinam has flooded multiple houses, leaving residents struggling with stagnant water. Locals have urged authorities to take swift action to drain the water and restore normalcy.Several north and delta districts of Tamil Nadu are likely to experience heavy rainfall as the Bay of Bengal is expected to witness the formation of the season’s second cyclonic storm by November 27. The cyclone will be named Senyar, meaning “lion,” by the UAE.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for very heavy rainfall (12–20 cm in 24 hours) on November 28 for three delta districts, November 29 for seven districts including Chennai, and November 30 for Tiruvallur.A yellow alert (6–12 cm) has been issued for southern districts on November 25 and for parts of the south and delta from November 26 to 28, before heavy rain shifts northwards on November 29–30.As of Monday, a well-marked low-pressure area with cyclonic circulation lay over Malaysia and the Strait of Malacca.It is expected to intensify into a depression over the south Andaman Sea by Tuesday and develop into a cyclone over the south Bay of Bengal within 48 hours.Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, and Karaikal may receive heavy to very heavy rainfall. Tuticorin, Ramanathapuram, Pudukkottai, Cuddalore, and Mayiladuthurai may get heavy rain.Rain is likely to spread to north Tamil Nadu, including Mayiladuthurai, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Chengalpet, Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, and Puducherry, with heavy to very heavy rainfall. Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Ariyalur, Kallakurichi, Tiruvannamalai, Ranipet, Vellore, and Karaikal may also get heavy rain.Tiruvallur may receive heavy to very heavy rainfall, while Chennai, Chengalpet, Kancheepuram, Ranipet, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram, and Puducherry may get heavy rain.On Monday, parts of Tamil Nadu recorded notable rainfall, including Parangipettai (Cuddalore) 4.5 cm, Kanyakumari 2 cm, and Nagapattinam 1.3 cm till 7:30 pm. Light rainfall was recorded in Nungambakkam (3.4 mm) and Meenambakkam (0.7 mm).Over the past few days, heavy rainfall in south Tamil Nadu led to 22 weather stations logging 10–20 cm in 24 hours. Oothu in Tirunelveli recorded 23 cm, Nalumukku 22 cm, Sethiathope in Cuddalore and Kakkachi in Tirunelveli 21 cm each, and Manjolai 19 cm.Current forecasts indicate the cyclone may move close to the Chennai coast on November 29–30, though models differ on the exact landfall, with some suggesting it may cross the Andhra Pradesh coast or move northwards into the Bay of Bengal before weakening. There is no update yet on whether schools in Tamil Nadu will be closed on Tuesday.Normal life was disrupted in Puducherry and Karaikal as heavy rainfall continued on Monday. Schools and colleges were declared closed to ensure safety. Rain since Saturday caused inundation of several housing colonies and main roads, affecting daily commuting and public activities.","Several north and delta districts of Tamil Nadu are likely to experience heavy rainfall.

'There is a Cisco': Why 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry is betting against Nvidia and Palantir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/there-is-a-cisco-why-big-short-investor-michael-burry-is-betting-against-nvidia-and-palantir/articleshow/125592596.cms,"Why it matters



Zoom in: Burry’s beef isn’t with Nvidia’s books-but its customers’



The big picture: A new bubble with a familiar face



What they're saying: Nvidia responds, Burry doubles down



What’s next



Michael Burry, the investor famed for betting against the US housing market in “The Big Short,” is now shorting Nvidia and Palantir-two flagbearers of the AI rally. In a blistering Substack post, Burry dismissed Nvidia’s internal memo rebutting his concerns as “disingenuous on the face, and disappointing. ”He accused the world’s most valuable company of deflecting criticism with “one straw man after another,” charging that Nvidia’s response failed to engage with his actual concerns around depreciation assumptions in the AI ecosystem. The fresh attack comes as investors increasingly debate whether the AI boom has tipped into bubble territory, a Business Insider report said.The criticism comes at a critical moment: Nvidia stock has dropped 14% from its early-November peak, and broader questions are emerging over whether AI’s gold rush has entered speculative territory.Burry’s remarks tap into mounting investor unease-not about innovation, but about how profits are being propped up by accounting choices that may not age well as chip cycles shorten.Burry clarified that he never accused Nvidia of stretching out the depreciation of its own factories or equipment. “No one cares about Nvidia’s own depreciation,” he wrote. “One straw man burnt.”Instead, he zeroed in on cloud giants-Microsoft, Meta, Oracle-who are reportedly extending chip and server depreciation timelines from 3 years to 5 or 6.That, Burry says, lets them spread massive AI hardware costs over longer periods, inflating earnings now while kicking losses down the road.He cited a Microsoft interview in which Satya Nadella said the company slowed data center buildouts to avoid overbuilding for one generation of AI chips-a move Burry sees as confirmation that tech’s depreciation timelines may be out of sync with reality.“The hyperscalers have been systematically increasing the useful lives of chips and servers, for depreciation purposes,” Burry warned.Burry says today’s AI surge echoes the dot-com bubble-just with faster hardware, loftier assumptions, and bigger accounting risks. He compared Nvidia to Cisco circa 2000, the centerpiece of tech euphoria before the crash.“There is a Cisco at the center of it all,” he wrote. “Its name is Nvidia.”In a particularly stark forecast, Burry predicted tech companies could understate depreciation by $176 billion between 2026 and 2028, warning that Meta, Oracle and others could overstate earnings by 20–27% if timelines aren't adjusted.Nvidia disputed Burry’s math, especially around its stock buybacks. The company clarified that it has repurchased $91 billion in shares since 2018-not $112.5 billion as Burry implied-and said he mistakenly included RSU-related taxes.Nvidia also defended its GPU longevity, arguing chips like the A100 (released in 2020) are still in full use, justifying longer depreciation periods.Burry remains unmoved. “I stand by my analysis,” he posted on X. “Obviously, the full analysis does not fit in a tweet.”Burry disclosed he still holds put options on both Nvidia and Palantir, despite the market’s growing appetite for all things AI. He claimed they cost about $10 million each-not the $1.1 billion their notional value implied.He’s now using his new paywalled newsletter, “Cassandra Unchained,” to argue that this AI cycle isn’t just about tech-it’s also about the accounting scaffolding propping it up.“I have been drawn into something much bigger than me,” he wrote.If he’s right again, this won’t be the last straw man he sets alight.(With inputs from agencies)","Michael Burry, the investor famed for betting against the US housing market in ‘The Big Short,’ is now shorting Nvidia and Palantir.

Explained: How China gained rare earths dominance — and what it means for the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/explained-how-china-gained-rare-earths-dominance-and-what-it-means-for-the-us/articleshow/125588339.cms,"AI image

US Turns to India to Curb China’s Rare Earth Grip, Global Alliance to Counter Beijing’s Moves

Why the US fell behind





America and allies search for alternatives





China’s control over rare earth elements did not happen overnight. It is the result of decades of investment across every stage of the chain — from mining and reserves to processing and technology — giving Beijing significant influence in its trade dispute with Washington.These 17 minerals are essential for defence equipment such as fighter jets, radar systems and missile guidance, and are also used in smartphones, medical tools and cars.According to news agency AFP reporters who visited Ganzhou this month, found the heavy rare earths region buzzing with activity despite tight surveillance.The area produces elements like yttrium and terbium, and the agency reporters witnessed trucks moving in and out of mines and busy processing plants.The city is also constructing new headquarters for China Rare Earth Group, one of two major state-owned players formed after years of government-led consolidation.Economics lecturer Heron Lim told AFP that recent disruptions have encouraged more countries to consider expanding their own production, adding that such moves “could pay longer-term dividends.”Trade tensions push rare earths to centre stageChina’s export restrictions announced in early October shook global manufacturers and alarmed Washington, which is locked in a renewed trade war with Beijing under President Donald Trump’s second term.After talks in South Korea, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce that temporarily secures supplies of rare earths and other minerals — a development widely viewed as favourable to Beijing.Lim said rare earths would likely remain central to future negotiations, noting that China has shown it is prepared to use trade tools to keep the US engaged. He added that the uncertainty has created difficulties for industries dependent on these metals.During the Cold War, the United States led the rare earths industry, with the Mountain Pass mine in California supplying much of the world.But as relations with Moscow improved and environmental concerns grew, the US shifted production overseas through the 1980s and 1990s.China now accounts for about two-thirds of global mining and roughly 90% of processing, according to analysis cited by AFP. It also holds the world’s largest reserves and leads in patents, supported by strict export controls on processing technology.Commodities analyst Amelia Haines was quoted by AFP as saying that the heavy reliance on imports poses “significant risks to critical industries,” which could accelerate a broader push for mineral security.The US has been attempting for years to rebuild its rare earths capacity. Defence agencies have invested heavily to establish a full “mine-to-magnet” chain by 2027.Washington has also signed critical minerals agreements with allies including Australia, Japan, Malaysia and Thailand.Trump recently announced an $8.5 billion rare earths partnership with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.This urgency is not new. In 2010, China briefly halted rare earth shipments to Japan during a territorial dispute, highlighting the geopolitical stakes.The Obama administration called for strengthening US resilience, yet 15 years on, China remains the dominant force in the sector.",China's control over rare earth elements did not happen overnight.

Budget leak shock: UK's Treasury chief Reeves unveils tax plan in Parliament; Labour braces for political fallout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/budget-leak-shock-uks-treasury-chief-reeves-unveils-tax-plan-in-parliament-labour-braces-for-political-fallout/articleshow/125590941.cms,"Britain’s Treasury chief Rachel Reeves delivered her tax-raising budget on Wednesday under the shadow of a major leak that exposed her proposals hours before she reached Parliament. The disclosure came from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which Reeves relies on for independent forecasts. According to AP, the leak effectively mapped out the entire fiscal package.The OBR said a “technical error” caused the documents to go live early on its website and apologised for the breach, adding that it would report the lapse to all relevant authorities, including the Treasury. AP reported that the biggest revenue measure is a freeze on tax thresholds that will push more earners into higher bands as wages rise.Other announcements flagged in the leaked papers include a mansion tax on high-value properties, changes to the capital tax regime and a reduction in tax-free allowances for private pensions. The documents estimate that the government will raise 26 billion pounds ($34 billion) in 2029–30.The episode has embarrassed the Labour government, which has already been grappling with weeks of speculation and mixed signals that unsettled financial markets.This is Reeves’ second budget since Labour’s landslide return to power in July 2024.Reeves repeated that her overall message remains unchanged from her first budget, when she said there would be only one major tax-raising exercise this parliamentary term, which runs to 2029. But the UK economy has struggled to match her expectations, with critics pointing to last year’s business tax increases as a drag.Although Britain briefly led the G7 in growth during the first half of the year, momentum faded again. “The chancellor faces a delicate balancing act of conveying fiscal stability while advancing the growth agenda,” said Peter Arnold, chief economist at EY UKBritain’s long struggle to recover from the 2008–09 financial crisis continues to weigh on tax revenues. Those pressures have been compounded by the economic costs of the pandemic, the Russia–Ukraine war and US President Donald Trump’s global tariffs, with Brexit adding additional strain since 2020.Reeves also faces a raft of spending promises aimed at easing the cost of living as inflation remains elevated. Measures include reversing planned welfare cuts, reviewing the cap on benefits for larger families and offering relief through frozen rail fares or lower green taxes on energy bills.The political stakes are high for Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is battling concern within Labour over his poor poll numbers. Surveys consistently place Labour behind Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. With an election not required until 2029, the government is banking on stronger growth to improve its standing, but analysts warn that a misjudged budget could deepen the sense of crisis around Starmer’s leadership.","Treasury chief Rachel Reeves delivered her tax-raising budget on Wednesday under the shadow of a major leak.

Inflation? Why Thanksgiving is cheaper this year (and what that says about the economy),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/inflation-why-thanksgiving-is-cheaper-this-year-and-what-that-says-about-the-economy/articleshow/125590223.cms,"The turkey got cheaper, not the world



Retailers are buying your gratitude



The feast is cheaper, the sides are sulking



Farmers were not invited to this celebration



Politics of the poultry index



The Costco shortcut and the new definition of convenience



what dishes count as “standard”,

how many portions they define as “normal”,

what ingredients get included or excluded,

how much profit margin they can hide in the bundle.

Cheap thanks, expensive future



Retailers are deliberately discounting turkey as a loss leader to attract shoppers.

Wholesale costs have not collapsed, meaning the discount is a financed illusion.

Some key food categories — especially grains — have cooled, reducing the cost of specific items.

Other categories — vegetables, fruits, beverages — remain expensive.

Consumers have traded down to store brands, frozen pies and smaller menus.

Farmers are facing higher costs and lower margins.

Inflation is slowing, not reversing.

Politicians are selling a narrative more than a macroeconomic reality.

For a country that once launched a revolution over the price of tea, America gets remarkably sentimental about the cost of turkey. Every November, economists, politicians and supermarket executives gather around a metaphorical table to debate the national poultry index, as if the fate of the republic depends on whether a 16-pound bird costs twenty dollars or twenty-five.This year, for the first time in a while, that conversation contains a four-letter word that Americans haven’t heard in a long time: down. The Thanksgiving dinner is officially cheaper. But the story of why it is cheaper is far more interesting than the number itself. It’s a tale of retail psychology, farmer misery, supply chain politics, and the great American tradition of pretending a discount is the same thing as prosperity.Let’s begin with the headline. The average cost of the classic Thanksgiving dinner for ten has dipped a few percentage points. The centrepiece of this softened inflation narrative is the turkey. A standard bird is significantly cheaper this year — the sharpest drop in years — and it has lowered the overall cost of the meal.But here’s the real twist: the world around that turkey is still expensive. Food-at-home prices remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels.Everyday staples like cereals, fresh vegetables, condiments and beverages are still inching upward. Grocery bills are not collapsing. They are simply not rising as brutally as they did in 2022 and 2023.Think of Thanksgiving as the supermarket’s Bollywood song-and-dance sequence. Eighty per cent of the movie is gritty realism. But for five minutes, everyone forgets their troubles and celebrates because the turkey looks cheap.Why is the turkey cheap if the world is not? Simple. Retailers are taking the hit.In the supermarket playbook, the Thanksgiving turkey is the emotional equivalent of “free delivery”. It’s a loss leader — the product a store sells at or below cost to drag you inside and make sure you buy everything else at full price.Grocery giants know that Americans treat Thanksgiving like a ritual. You must buy the turkey. You must buy the sides. You must buy the extras. The only question is where. And that is where the retail war begins.Several major chains are deliberately discounting turkeys even though their own acquisition costs have gone up. Wholesale prices have risen due to disease outbreaks in turkey flocks and feed costs that haven’t come down nearly enough. But supermarkets are absorbing that pain because the turkey discount is an unbeatable form of customer acquisition.Tech companies give free trials. Supermarkets sacrifice poultry margins.And as every business student learns on day one: customer eyeballs today are worth more than profit margins this week.This “cheaper Thanksgiving” narrative also depends heavily on what you choose to count.Turkey and wheat-based products — bread, buns, pie crusts — have become cheaper thanks to slightly better global crop cycles and softer consumer demand. Frozen items, store brands and bulk packs have also become more popular, forcing retailers to compete on price.But vegetables? Those are having an existential crisis. Weather disruptions in key growing regions have hit sweet potatoes and green beans. Basic vegetable trays have shot up in price in many parts of the country. Fresh fruit is pricier thanks to transportation and import pressures. Canned goods, especially those dependent on metal and packaging costs, are not giving any Thanksgiving discounts.So yes, the meal looks cheaper. But it is the turkey that is doing the heavy lifting while half the sides are quietly sulking in the corner, waiting for someone to notice their suffering.If there is one group that does not feel thankful this year, it is the American farming community.Consumers see the downturn in the cost of the Thanksgiving basket. Farmers see a very different ledger. Crop prices for some staples have declined, but their input costs haven’t. Fertiliser, fuel, machinery and labour remain stubbornly high. Weather shocks — drought, heat waves, erratic rains — continue to disrupt yields unpredictably.Turkey farmers, in particular, have been hammered. Outbreaks of avian flu have led to culling entire flocks after a single infection. One diseased bird means a financial disaster for a farmer who spent months raising hundreds. Retailers can afford to discount a turkey. Farmers cannot afford to lose one.The Thanksgiving discount that consumers are celebrating is made possible partly because someone else is swallowing pain higher up the supply chain.This is not a moral argument. It is a business one. Retailers compress margins aggressively. Farmers have no margins left to compress. Inflation did not leave. It simply dressed up as generosity. This is the part where inflation performs one of its favourite magic tricks: anchoring.After years of high inflation, consumers have adjusted their expectations upwards. So when a $64 Thanksgiving meal becomes a $55 meal, it feels like a relief — even if the same dinner cost far less just a few years ago. This is not victory. It is relief masquerading as recovery.And retailers exploit this psychology brilliantly. A sharply discounted, culturally significant product creates a narrative of “things are finally getting better”. Meanwhile, dozens of other items around the store have quietly gone up by 2 to 10 percent. You notice the cheap turkey. You do not notice the expensive soda, the quietly inflated butter, or the premium packaging costs.In business terms, the turkey is the shiny notification. Everything else is the terms and conditions.Any national holiday with food and numbers will inevitably be hijacked by politics. Thanksgiving is no exception.Cheap turkey prices become evidence of economic competency. Expensive turkey prices become evidence of national collapse. Every White House, regardless of party, loves claiming credit for a “cheaper Thanksgiving”, even when the primary drivers are retail strategy, not government policy.This year, politicians have repeated the line that the Thanksgiving meal is significantly cheaper. They highlight the change from last year. They do not highlight the change from 2018 or 2015, because that comparison is far less flattering.The turkey aisle becomes a political prop. The optics serve everyone. Retailers get attention. Politicians get talking points. Consumers get the illusion of victory.Everyone wins the narrative. No one wins the economics.There’s another emerging trend: the pre-assembled Thanksgiving meal. Big box retailers now offer complete kits that feed families for less than the average DIY cost.On the surface, this looks like efficiency and savings. Underneath, it is something else entirely.When you outsource your Thanksgiving meal to a corporation, the company gains power over:Software companies call this bundling. Economists call it controlling the supply chain. Grandma calls it “not my Thanksgiving”.Think of it as the Netflix-ification of holiday meals. A corporation decides the menu. You just show up and hit play.So why exactly is Thanksgiving cheaper this year?Let’s strip away the marketing and look at the mechanics:This year’s Thanksgiving is not proof that the economy is healed. It is proof that retailers are very good at narrative management. The Thanksgiving basket is a PR campaign wrapped in aluminium foil.It is also a case study in how the American consumer economy works. When inflation rages, retailers raise prices. When inflation softens, retailers lower selective prices and call it generosity. When the economy is jittery, the turkey becomes a bargaining chip in a much larger psychological war for customer loyalty.And here is the final irony.Americans will sit around their tables this November and give thanks for a slightly cheaper meal. But the price cut is not the result of a benevolent market, a miraculous supply chain recovery or a sudden burst of federal competence.It is the result of carefully calibrated retail economics. Someone decided that your gratitude was worth a discounted bird. Someone else — usually a farmer — paid for that gratitude out of their own margins. And the rest of the store quietly made back what the turkey lost.The turkey may be cheaper. The world around it is not. But in a year where everything feels a bit fragile, America will take the small win. Even if it is cooked, seasoned and packaged to perfection by the marketing department.",The average cost of the classic Thanksgiving dinner for ten has dipped a few percentage points. A standard bird is significantly cheaper this year — the sharpest drop in years. But here’s the real twist: the world around that turkey is still expensive.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125590328,imgsize-56612,width-400,resizemode-4/why-your-turkey-is-cheaper-this-year.jpg"

China has purchased at least 10 cargoes of US soybeans, worth around $300 million, in contracts signed since Tuesday, sources quoted by news agency Reuters claimed.The deals come a day after US President Donald Trump spoke with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, signalling a thaw in trade relations between the two countries.Each cargo ranges between 60,000 and 65,000 metric tons, with shipments scheduled for January from Gulf Coast terminals and the Pacific Northwest.Trump, commenting on the renewed engagement, said he had urged Xi to accelerate and increase China’s purchases of American goods, adding that the Chinese leader had “more or less agreed,” reported Reuters.The purchases extend a surge in Chinese buying following late-October talks in South Korea and reflect efforts to stabilise bilateral dialogue on trade.Despite US soybeans being priced higher than Brazilian alternatives, China paid premiums of $2.3 per bushel over the January Chicago futures contract for Gulf shipments and $2.2 per bushel for Pacific Northwest cargoes, compared with around $1.8 per bushel for Brazilian supplies.Johnny Xiang, founder of Beijing-based AgRadar Consulting, was quoted by Reuters as saying, “Commercial buyers will continue to avoid US soybean imports, as prices remain higher than Brazilian beans.At these levels, crush margins are not financially viable.”State-run COFCO has led the recent buying spree, securing nearly 2 million tons of US soybeans since late October, as per Reuters.While these deals fall short of the 12 million tons previously announced by the White House, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the purchases are “right on schedule,” citing a broader agreement for China to buy 87.5 million tons of American soybeans over the next three-and-a-half years.Trump and Xi’s phone call on Monday addressed a wide range of issues, including trade, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fentanyl controls, and agricultural products like soybeans.Trump expressed optimism about bilateral cooperation, saying, “I think we will be pleasantly surprised by the actions of President Xi. I have a great relationship with him. I like him. He likes me… He invited me to visit Beijing in April, which I accepted”.","China has purchased at least 10 cargoes of US soybeans, worth around $300 million, in contracts signed since Tuesday.

FULL: ‘AMERICANS, DON’T FORGET!’: Trump ROASTS Dems, ENDS Shutdown, Wants Filibuster Gone | Watch

The United States began the 2026 fiscal year with a $284 billion federal deficit in October, a figure shaped by record tariff revenue but also distorted by a major shift in benefit payments and delays caused by a 43-day federal shutdown.The Treasury said the shutdown postponed some agency spending, including pay for federal employees, though the impact on total outlays was estimated at under 5%.The deficit was 10% higher than the $257 billion shortfall recorded a year earlier, largely because roughly $105 billion in November benefits for certain military and healthcare programmes were pulled into October, as per Reuters.Without that shift, the monthly deficit would have been about $180 billion — a 29% drop from an adjusted October 2024 figure of $252 billion.Total outlays reached $689 billion — up 18% from last year — boosted by the reclassified benefit payments, reported Reuters.Some departments, however, showed lower spending, reflecting the delay in passing annual appropriations until 12 November, as per Bloomberg.Meanwhile, interest costs on federal debt climbed to $104 billion, a 27% increase from a year earlier, due to a higher debt load and a 3.36% average rate.October receipts hit a record $404 billion, up 24% from last year, supported by customs duties, as per Reuters.Tariff revenues surged to an unprecedented $31.4 billion after new import duties imposed by President Donald Trump since returning to office, eclipsing September’s previous record.Customs duties had averaged about $29 billion over the prior three months. Trump said tariff collections would “skyrocket” as firms depleted pre-tariff inventories. In a message targeting the Supreme Court, which has questioned the legality of some emergency-based tariffs, he wrote, “I look so much forward to the United States Supreme Court’s decision… so that we can continue… to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”However, the Congressional Budget Office recently cut its estimate of how much Trump’s tariffs would reduce deficits over the next decade, lowering the projection from $4 trillion to $3 trillion due to tariff rollbacks from recent trade deals.Other revenue gains came from an $80 billion surge in non-withheld individual tax payments, up 75% from last year, mainly because California wildfire victims were allowed to delay filing until 15 October.Withheld taxes rose 6% to $279 billion, but corporate tax receipts were flat at $18 billion, which the Treasury attributed to tax breaks in a Republican-backed bill enacted this year.According to Bloomberg, treasury secretary Scott Bessent expects tariff revenue to accelerate and has suggested collections could reach $500 billion annually, though the pending Supreme Court case and Trump’s proposal to pay tariff “dividends” to citizens could complicate borrowing needs.Non-discretionary spending — including Social Security, healthcare and interest — continued to push deficits upward.Record tariff income last year offset only part of the 2025 deficit, which totalled $1.78 trillion, as per Bloomberg.Bessent has highlighted the drop in the deficit-to-GDP ratio from 6.4% to 5.9% as evidence of progress, saying he aims to bring it “to something with a three in front of it” by the end of Trump’s term.",The United States began the 2026 fiscal year with a $284 billion federal deficit in October.

UK wage rise: Minimum pay raised for 2.7 million workers from April; businesses warn of higher cost pressures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/uk-wage-rise-minimum-pay-raised-for-2-7-million-workers-from-april-businesses-warn-of-higher-cost-pressures/articleshow/125581745.cms,"File photo: Chancellor Rachel Reeves (Picture credit: AP)

Millions of low-paid workers in the UK will receive a pay increase from April as the government confirmed new minimum wage rates ahead of Wednesday’s Budget.The hourly rate for over-21s will rise by 50p to £12.71, with 18–20-year-olds seeing an 85p jump to £10.85, and under-18s and apprentices receiving £8 an hour after a 45p increase.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said 2.7 million people will benefit from the changes.The rise follows last year’s 6.7% increase for over-21s and 16.3% for 18–20-year-olds, when employers also faced higher National Insurance contributions, reported BBC.Reeves said the cost of living remained the biggest issue for working people and that “the economy isn’t working well enough for those on the lowest incomes”.She added that the increases ensured workers were “properly rewarded” for their labour, a point also emphasised by the government in, as per The Guardian.However, businesses warned of pressure on hiring and prices. UK Hospitality chair Kate Nicholls said firms had “reached their limit of absorbing seemingly endless additional costs” and would have to pass them on to consumers, fuelling inflation.The British Chambers of Commerce said every above-inflation rise added to business strain, with deputy public policy director Jane Gratton noting, ‘There's a limit to how much additional cost employers can bear without something having to give’, as per BBC.The Treasury said the new minimum wage rates for 2026 struck a balance among worker needs, business affordability and employment opportunities.However, steep pay rises could hinder job prospects for young people.The Resolution Foundation warned the increase for 18–20-year-olds was “unnecessarily big” and risked pushing up NEET (not in education, employment or training) rates.Still, the Low Pay Commission maintained previous rises “have not had a significant negative impact on jobs,” as per BBC.Commission chair Philippa Stroud said the body had weighed cost-of-living pressures against employer challenges and observed that “no one is having an easy time”.The government also confirmed additional measures, including extending the sugar tax to milk-based drinks, expanding the Help to Save scheme and giving English regional mayors powers to impose a tourist tax.","2.7 million low-paid workers in the UK will receive a pay increase from April. hourly rate for over-21s will rise by 50p to £12.71. 18–20-year-olds will see an 85p jump to £10.85, and under-18s and apprentices £8 an hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125581848,imgsize-771627,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-70.jpg"

Asian markets climbed on Wednesday as softer US data strengthened expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month, while crude prices steadied after touching one-month lows.Asia followed Wall Street’s upbeat momentum after a run of weaker-than-expected US figures boosted confidence in a December rate cut.According to news agency AFP, several Fed policymakers have backed a third consecutive reduction, citing labour market concerns even as inflation remains elevated.Fresh data — some delayed by the US government shutdown — reinforced that outlook.Payroll firm ADP reported that private employers shed an average 13,500 jobs per week in the four weeks to 8 November, while retail sales growth slowed and consumer confidence fell to a seven-month low.Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management was quoted by AFP as saying that although the backlog of data was “extremely stale”, markets desperate for macro signals were interpreting it as dovish.He noted that Goldman Sachs economists had trimmed Q3 GDP tracking to 3.7%, supporting the view that growth is cooling ahead of the December meeting.Risk appetite also improved after Bloomberg reported that Kevin Hassett, a close ally of President Donald Trump, is seen as the frontrunner to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell next year.Analysts said his appointment would likely support Trump’s push for lower rates.Asian stocks rose sharply in response. Tokyo and Seoul gained around 2%, while Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Taipei and Wellington also traded higher, as per AFP.The advance followed a pullback earlier this month over concerns about high valuations in the tech sector. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba slipped more than 1% after reporting a profit decline due to increased consumer subsidies and AI-related investments.MSCI’s Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index rose 1%, while Japan’s Nikkei added 1.8%.Analysts at Westpac said sentiment improved as traders priced in an 80.7% probability of a 25-basis-point cut at the Fed’s 10 December meeting, compared to even odds a week earlier.Meanwhile, oil prices saw a mild rebound after falling sharply on Tuesday. As per Reuters, Brent rose 0.3% to $62.67, and WTI gained 0.24% to $58.09, following indications that Ukraine is close to agreeing to a US-backed peace plan with Russia.IG’s Tony Sycamore was quoted by Reuters as saying that a completed deal could “rapidly dismantle Western sanctions on Russian energy exports”, potentially pushing WTI towards $55 unless talks break down.US President Trump has instructed his representatives to meet both Russian and Ukrainian officials, while Zelenskiy may visit the US soon to finalise a deal.Recent sanctions remain tight, though Russian oil shipments to India are expected to hit a three-year low in December, Reuters reported.Hopes of a Fed rate cut have also lent support to crude, as lower borrowing costs typically boost economic activity and demand for oil.Gold traded 0.2% higher at $4,131.78, while Bitcoin rose 0.5% to $87,438.53.",Asian markets climb on Wednesday as softer US data strengthened expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month.

US consumer confidence weakened in November, falling to its second-lowest reading since April as Americans grew more wary of elevated prices, sluggish job gains and the fallout of the prolonged government shutdown, according to an AP report.The Conference Board said on Tuesday that its consumer confidence index dropped to 88.7 in November, down from an upwardly revised 95.5 in October. The latest reading reflects broad economic concerns across political lines and was “particularly sharp among independents,” the Board noted.The decline followed a 43-day government shutdown that delayed crucial economic data, disrupted federal paychecks and slowed business activity. A separate government report earlier in the day showed retail sales softened in September, reinforcing expectations that the final quarter of the year could see a significant slowdown.“We do not think that consumer spending is about to hit a cliff, as spending has decoupled from confidence, but risks to the downside are increasing,” said Thomas Simons, chief US economist at Jefferies.Americans’ perceptions of the labour market deteriorated.The share of consumers calling jobs “plentiful” slipped to 27.6%, down from 28.6% in October and sharply lower than 37% in December. Those saying jobs were “hard to get” held at 17.9%, slightly below October’s 18.3% but well above 15.2% in September.Inflation and affordability issues remained top of mind. “Consumers’ write-in responses… continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade, and politics, with increased mentions of the federal government shutdown,” said Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board.President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs earlier this year had already rattled markets and pushed up costs. The Board warned that sustained worries about prices could further dent household confidence.Despite the downbeat sentiment, economists estimate the US economy likely grew at an annual rate of about 3% in the July–September quarter. But with the shutdown dragging on activity and weak hiring expected to persist, growth is forecast to cool notably in the final three months of the year.","The Conference Board said on Tuesday that its consumer confidence index dropped to 88.7 in November, down from an upwardly revised 95.5 in October.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

Minuscule AI startup raises $41 million to tap India growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/minuscule-ai-startup-raises-41-million-to-tap-india-growth/articleshow/105804471.cms,"A generative artificial intelligence startup targeting the Indian market raised $41 million in fresh funding, the largest such round by an early-stage AI contender in the country.Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages at price points that the country’s 1.4 billion people can afford. The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners, formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam AI is building large language models targeted at unique uses in Indian languages.

Seven trillion USD economy size by 2030 is possible if India maintains its present growth trajectory, and in that journey startup entrepreneurs are going to play an important role,"" he is quoted as having said in the release.He was of the view that the active participation of startups in India in developing business models on the foundation of expanding physical and digital infrastructure will continue to generate efficiency, revenue and economic returns for the country.""The last decade has seen an exceptional transformation in the startup landscape in India, which has emerged as the third largest ecosystem globally, with over 1.12 lakh startups presently recognised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) across 763 districts.""Among them, more than 110 are unicorns with a total valuation of around USD 350 billion,"" he said.The CEA further said that the country ranks second in innovation quality.He said that innovation in India was not just limited to certain sectors as startups were solving problems in 56 industrial sectors, with 13 per cent of them from IT services, nine per cent from health and life sciences, seven per cent from education, five per cent from agriculture and five per cent from food and beverages.Nageswaran also said it was significant that 49 per cent of the startups were from tier-2 and 3 cities which have turned to be game-changers as the business advantages in these locations enable entrepreneurs to operate at lower costs as compared to tier-1 cities.""Apart from improved infrastructure and the government's pro-active policies, the availability of a technically skilled talent pool is a huge advantage for startups to set up and flourish in tier-2 and tier-3 cities,"" he said.He said that historically there was a perception that small towns were difficult places to conduct business.""...but with improved internet penetration, vastly better physical infrastructure, road, rail and air connectivity and supportive government policies, this is no longer true,"" he said.He also noted Kerala's startup journey has been an inspiring one.The CEA said that KSUM has served as the catalyst since its establishment in 2006 to promote change that propelled the state into the forefront of the global startup arena.KSUM is the Kerala government's nodal agency established in 2006 for entrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.Nageswaran said that with over 4,000 registered tech startups, 63 incubators and 10 lakh square feet of incubation space, KSUM has not only met its goal of promoting technology-based entrepreneurship but has also earned the distinguished position of being among the world's top business incubators.The November 16-18 fifth edition of Huddle Global, India's biggest beachside startup conclave, was organised by KSUM at Adimalathura beach, near Vizhinjam, here.Attended by around 1,500 delegates, the event displayed sophisticated products from emerging sectors such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, life sciences, space tech, blockchain, IoT, e-governance, fintech, healthtech, agritech, edutech and SaaS from across the country.","Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said tier-2 and 3 cities, including Kerala's capital, have become game-changers in helping startups flourish in the country.

E-Commerce startup Udaan to trim costs ahead of 2025 IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-startup-udaan-to-trim-costs-ahead-of-2025-ipo/articleshow/105001132.cms,"E-commerce startup Udaan is working to curb costs and forge new partnerships with consumer brands in India as it prepares to go public in 2025.Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta said in an interview. That’s set to happen around the same time as its initial public offering, he said.The priority “is steady and predictable financial performance,” Gupta said. “Second, strategically we want to ensure that we are top of mind with shopkeepers, with big manufacturers, and we maintain our relative market share.”Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Udaan is among startups trying to tap the rapid growth of India’s economy and consumer market, while meeting investor demands for profitability. Udaan, which at its peak employed thousands, joined fellow Indian startups in slashing jobs last year and tightening internal controls and compliance. It now has about 1,800 staff, and Gupta didn’t specify if further job cuts are needed.Corporate governance lapses at Indian online tutoring firm Byju’s, once the country’s top startup with a valuation of $22 billion, shone a light at unique challenges faced by founders in the South Asian nation and drove companies to be more diligent.“We continue to move towards more professionalized management, professionalized board and also institutionalized shareholders as we go towards public markets,” Gupta said.Udaan is yet to decide whether it will list in India or overseas. It was valued at more than $3 billion in a 2021 funding round, and was in talks to raise $400 million, Business Standard reported in September. Lightspeed owns about 35% of Udaan, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. holds 6%.The company was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran Udaan until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

That kind of digital-led wholesale business still accounts for a very small part of India’s overall retail market but can balloon to $150 billion in sales and yield a 100% return on capital invested in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co. estimates published in the Mint newspaper.Bengaluru-based Udaan has also ventured into financing through its fintech unit which helps shopkeepers get working capital loans to buy inventory. That business is profitable before taxes and is growing 70% annually, Gupta said.“That’s a second business in the overall umbrella of Udaan trying to organize trade in the country,” Gupta said. “In addition to commerce, financing becomes an important market opportunity.”","Udaan will make an operating profit within 18 months, Chief Executive Officer Vaibhav Gupta says.

Income Tax Department Crackdown

Income Tax Department’s extensive crackdown! Over the past 20 months, the Income Tax Department has collected Rs 37,000 crore from individuals who had taxable income but failed to file returns, according to officials.Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash. ""These are the cases where people were not filing tax returns despite making large purchases. The department had reached out to them over the past 20 months,"" a senior official informed ET.The official noted that an expanded and stricter tax collection and TDS system has helped identify significant transactions that previously went unnoticed.The official indicated that some individuals submitted returns claiming zero income despite substantial expenditure and tax obligations. From the total Rs 37,000 crore recovered, Rs 1,320 crore came from individuals involved in high-value transactions.The department is conducting an extensive initiative to contact taxpayers whose spending patterns do not align with their declared income.Since FY21, it has actively used data analytics and the Non-Filer Monitoring System to identify non-compliant individuals.""Data from multiple sources is being tapped and synchronised... This makes it easy for the department to identify such evasion and nab evaders,"" the official stated.Official data revealed that direct tax collections for April-November increased by 15.4% to Rs 12.10 lakh crore, comprising Rs 5.10 lakh crore in corporate tax and Rs 6.61 lakh crore in non-corporate tax.","Officials analysed data on substantial transactions since 2019-20, including purchases of gems, jewellery, property and luxury holidays paid in cash.

"ITR filing deadline: Don’t miss December 31, 2024 deadline for revised, belated tax returns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/itr-filing-deadline-dont-miss-december-31-2024-deadline-for-revised-belated-tax-returns-here-are-the-consequences/articleshow/116495382.cms,"If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.

ITR filing: What are the consequences of missing the belated return filing deadline on December 31, 2024?



ITR filing: What if you miss the revised return filing December 31, 2024 deadline?

ITR filing deadline : December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25). Whilst various taxpayer categories have distinct ITR filing deadlines, the final date for belated and revised returns remains the same. Many individuals remain unaware of the implications of missing the December 31, 2024, submission deadline for FY 2023-24.If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2024, specific consequences apply.Under Section 139(4) of the Income Tax Act, belated returns incur a Rs 5,000 penalty, regardless of outstanding tax amounts. A reduced penalty of Rs 1,000 applies for lower taxable income. However, individuals with income below the Rs 3 lakh basic exemption limit face no penalties.Kinjal Bhuta, Secretary of Bombay Chartered Accountants' Society, told ET, ""Belated return is the last chance for the taxpayer to file the ITR and claim refunds and certain losses. If the belated return is not filed, the person misses those claims and credits for that assessment year. After the expiry of the filing of the belated return, only an updated return can be filed subject to the condition that there is a tax liability payable. Further, if no belated return is filed, the taxpayer shall have to face increased interests and penalties on the tax liabilities if a notice is sent by the income tax department.""A significant limitation of filing belated returns for FY 2023-24 is the inability to select the old tax regime , as the new regime became default from April 1, 2023. Consequently, belated returns must follow the new tax regime .Also Read | Avoid Rs 10 lakh income tax penalty! Why it's important to report foreign income, assets in ITR by December 31, 2024 - check details The old tax regime offered various deductions and exemptions unavailable in the new tax regime. These provisions helped reduce taxable income and subsequent tax obligations.The new regime permits only two deductions: a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) and employer NPS contributions up to 10% of basic salary. Additional benefits like Section 80C, 80D, and HRA exemptions are not applicable under the new structure.When a taxpayer needs to rectify errors in original or belated returns, they must submit a revised return. This allows corrections of various oversights, such as unreported income, unclaimed deductions, or omitted bank account details.Bhuta says, ""If the taxpayer misses the deadline to file a revised return, there is no other mechanism to file a revised return again for that assessment year and to claim refunds or losses. The income tax laws allow the filing of an updated return. However, the updated return cannot be filed in cases where the taxpayer has losses, it results in an increased refund, or the tax return has an effect of reducing the total tax liability as filed in the original or belated return. There are many other criteria as to when an updated return cannot be filed. So, if a taxpayer misses the revised return deadline, the only way in which any additional claim or credit can be requested is during the assessment proceedings. However, that is subject to litigation.""Also Read | PAN 2.0: How to easily apply for PAN Card reprint with QR code - check 6 simple steps online Whilst taxpayers can submit multiple revised returns, tax experts advise against frequent revisions as this could trigger scrutiny from the Income Tax Department.Regarding intimation notices, Bhuta explains, ""As per section 139(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, ITR can be revised only before three months before the end of the relevant assessment year or before the completion of assessment, whichever event happens first. The ITR can be revised even after an intimation has been received under section 143(1). However, once the ITR is processed under a regular scrutiny assessment under section 143(3), the same cannot be revised.""For the financial year 2023-24 (AY 2024-25), taxpayers have until December 31, 2024, to submit their revised returns.","December 31, 2024, marks the final deadline for submitting belated and revised income tax returns for FY 2023-24 (AY 2024-25) If one fails to submit a belated return by December 31, 2016, specific consequences apply.

Elon Musk-led Tesla has recommenced its search for showroom locations in New Delhi, according to two sources who spoke to Reuters, indicating a potential reconsideration of its Indian market entry after previously suspending investment plans this year.Following a temporary pause in its Indian showroom search, Tesla has now initiated preliminary discussions with DLF regarding space in the capital region, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the developments.According to one source, Tesla seeks 3,000 to 5,000 square feet for a customer experience centre, plus additional space triple that size for service and delivery operations.The company is considering various locations, including DLF's Avenue Mall in southern Delhi and the Cyber Hub complex in Gurugram.Earlier this year, Elon Musk indicated plans to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and potentially announce a $2-3 billion investment in India.

Rupee sees relative gain as other currencies fall more vs $: RBI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-sees-relative-gain-as-other-currencies-fall-more-vs-rbi/articleshow/116665295.cms,"MUMBAI: A relatively weak rupee, in the short term, benefits India's trade balance, a report published by RBI said. However, in the long run, a stronger rupee is more beneficial to trade balance. Trade balance is the difference between exports and imports of goods and services.The report, published in RBI's Nov bulletin, carries data on the real effective exchange rate (REER), which points to an overvaluation of the rupee in relative terms in Nov as other currencies depreciated at a higher rate against the dollar. REER is an index that measures the country's currency against a basket of other currencies.According to data published by RBI, the 40-country trade-weighted REER index rose from 90.9 to 91.8 in one month while the six-currency basket rose from 104.4 to 105.3. The six countries in the smaller basket are the US, China, Eurozone, Hong Kong, the UK and Japan.Following Donald Trump's win in the US presidential election in early Nov, the dollar has gained against all major currencies including the rupee. However, the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar has been less than that of other currencies resulting in an appreciation of the REER.The researchers note that rising productivity in the tradable goods sector in India has played a role in the continued appreciation of the REER. The report suggests that policymakers need to be mindful of the asymmetric and time-varying impact of REER changes on the trade balance.The REER is also important from a financial stability perspective. In the past, IMF had noted the importance of monitoring REER fluctuations as part of broader financial stability assessments as historical data shows that significant deviations in the index can precede financial crisis.","The report, published in RBI's Nov bulletin, carries data on the real effective exchange rate (REER) REER is an index that measures the country's currency against a basket of other currencies.

India should seek to push potential growth from 6% to 8%: World Bank chief economist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-should-seek-to-push-potential-growth-from-6-to-8-world-bank-chief-economist/articleshow/116661763.cms,"What are the major concerns in the global economy? Are the problems facing middle-income countries like India unique and how they should deal with them?

So, what’s the way forward? What can middle-income economies do to reverse this dismal trend?

What bright spots do you see in India?

In a recent piece you estimated that it may take India 75 years to reach one fourth of the US per capita income. How can it shrink this timeframe?

Women participation in the workforce is something that has been talked about a lot in recent years. What is the solution?

What about investments?

In September, a World Bank report talked about high tariffs in India and restrictive policies in services. In recent weeks, Donald Trump made a statement about India’s high tariffs. How crucial is it for India to revisit some of its policies?

We recently interviewed Thomas Piketty and he talked about the need to impose 2% wealth tax on the ultra-rich 167 families to reduce inequality. Chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran , however, cautioned about the possibility of flight of capital and suggested it may not be the best solution. What is your view?

World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill believes there are several things going for India – from the demographics to geopolitics and from a large domestic market to low debt levels in the private sector. He tells TOI in an interview that India should seek to push its potential growth from 6% to 8% by focusing on greater efficiency and economic freedom and quality education and by staying open to FDI and trade.In summarizing the problems facing the global economy, it is useful to think of the world as consisting of low-income countries, emerging markets, and advanced economies. The difficulties that each group is facing are distinct. Policy makers in advanced economies such as those in the Euro Area have brought inflation down and are now again worried about sluggish growth because of adverse demographics and slowing productivity growth. You can call this the problem of secular stagnation. In middle-income countries the problem is that, aside from a few exceptions like China, growth rates have not been high or steady enough for quick convergence to the living standards of advanced economies. We call it the middle-income trap. Low-income countries--mostly in Africa but also countries like Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria--have not been doing well since the mid-2010s. Their GDP growth rates have barely kept up with population growth, so their citizens have experienced zero or negative income growth. They have suffered a lost decade, and the prospects for the next decade are not much better. The global economy is settling down to a rate of growth rate much lower than what it was before the COVID crisis, which was in turn much lower than it was before the global financial crisis. So, with each crisis, the world economy seems to be coming down to a lower growth rate. In the case of middle-income countries that are home to 75% of the world's population, the drop in GDP growth is especially rapid: from an annual average of 6% in the 2000s to 5% in the 2010s to a projected 4% in the 2020s.We have just completed a serious inquiry into this in the latest World Development Report. We have tried to distill the lessons from successful developers like South Korea and Taiwan in Asia, Poland and Hungary in Europe, and Chile and Uruguay in Latin America. These countries encouraged private investment by keeping inflation down and making things easier for enterprises, they brought in new technologies from abroad and made them widely available domestically (we call this infusion), and they displayed both patience and discipline in timing the shift to innovation-led development. China has also been doing many of the same things and there are signs that countries like India and Vietnam are also working towards a good mix of policies to encourage investment, infusion and innovation. What is working against today's middle-income economies is that they are facing both a more difficult external environment--growing protectionism in advanced economies and rising concerns about climate change--and domestic difficulties like record levels of debt and rapidly aging populations.India is a lot more fortunate than the typical middle-income economy. For the next two decades, it will have an extraordinarily favourable demography. Investors in advanced economies looking to diversify away from China find it attractive. It is a large and rapidly growing market, so foreign firms will become ever more interested in establishing operations in India. Its private sector is not heavily indebted--by one measure its private debt ratios are less than one quarter those of China's. Its economy is more balanced than China's: in that the ratio of consumption to GDP is normal, so it depends less on foreign consumption and its economic growth will not be as threatening as was China's growth during the last two decades. Even the geopolitics are quite favourable for India. I would say that during the next two decades, India will be at prime potential; put another way, the Indian economy will never again be able to grow as much as it can over the next two decades. It cannot miss this golden opportunity.The 75-year estimate is not written in stone; that time period can be shrunk by decades. As I said, India will be at peak potential between now and 2047; the question is how to realize that potential. We estimate India's potential growth rate at about 6%, it should be pushed up to 8%. India needs to become more efficient in the use of capital, skilled labour, and energy. Increasing efficiency requires some serious structural reforms: becoming more open to foreign investment, trade and technologies; using the talents of women and disadvantaged sections of society better; and using energy more efficiently by better pricing and regulation, and reforming state-owned enterprises that generate, transmit and distribute power. It has to as much in education as it has done so successfully in digital infrastructure and roads. India also needs to invest more, and that investment has to come from the private sector. Luckily, India's private enterprises are in good shape for this.It's not as if you have to do it over the next two years; India has a window of two decades. But things will never be as good again when this period is over, so it must be done with a sense of urgency. I think the Prime Minister has done exactly the right thing by setting the goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047.The solution probably consists of three parts. The first is to determine the facts. There is a lot of disagreement about what the female labour force participation rate is in India. There is no such controversy in, say, China or the United States. This needs to be sorted out. After meeting with experts in MOSPI, I am hopeful that it soon will be. Second, after we agree on the facts, I expect the solutions to improve women's work participation will be different in different parts of the country, say in the Hindi-speaking belt as compared with the South. In some places or sections of society the fix might be cultural, in others it might be education-related, and in yet others it might have to do with public safety. The third part will have to do with ensuring equal opportunity through well-designed and implemented legislation.I think that the world grossly underestimates the economic benefits of better use of the talents of women and disadvantaged groups. The case of the US is eye-opening. In the 1960s and 1970s, when anti-discrimination legislation was first introduced, 94% of America's lawyers and doctors were white men. Today, today that ratio is less than half that. Without these changes, the estimates are that US GDP would have been about a third lower than it is today. Viksit Bharat will be achieved decades sooner with such measures than it will be without them.India has to invest in more in capital of all kinds: human, physical, financial and infrastructural capital. On infrastructure capital, India has been doing well. On physical and financial capital, things could be better: India's private investment to GDP ratio has been essentially stagnant for the last decade and has room to grow. But India's investment in human capital--especially in secondary schooling, polytechnics, and higher education--needs to increase massively over the next decade. The main problem is not a shortage of money; the problem is more likely a serious shortage of political will to radically reorganize public education to prepare young people for a world of work that will be completely different from the time when these institutions were conceived. But I don't sense any urgency when I speak with state governments. I get a sense of urgency when I talk to government officials in Delhi, though I also detect frustration that they can't do much without state government support.What we recommend for smaller economies--there are more than 150 of them outside the G20--is to make trade and foreign direct investment easier, regardless of what richer or bigger economies are doing. India can do a lot more to improve the general conditions for foreign trade and investment. But when I listen to the debates among Indian economists, the talk is too much about whether to make a big bet on services or on manufacturing. For a large economy with both great potential and great inefficiency, the right way is to bet on everything: more on services, more on manufacturing, and more on agribusiness. A good place to start is to increase economic freedom, much as how Vietnam has done during the last five years. I know that the government is not an avid consumer of international rankings, but they do contain useful information. The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom, for example, has India ranked next to Nigeria and Brazil. Vietnam's index is closer to Mexico's and South Korea's.I agree completely with the CEA. Taxing wealth is about taxing people who have choices about where to keep their wealth. Besides, when you consider wealth and inheritance taxes, you have to account for the structure of the economy and the experience of countries that have experimented with high wealth and inheritance taxes. In India, the preponderance of family-owned enterprises means that a sizeable part of an individual's wealth is the value of the family firm. When the head of the family dies, the survivors will have to liquidate the firm or borrow to pay a high inheritance tax. Neither helps the firm become bigger. But India's problem is to grow enterprises which tend to stay too small, not to shrink them even more. And there can be other complications where large publicly traded firms are involved. South Korea has a very high inheritance tax. If the head of a conglomerate dies and his or shares shares have to be sold to pay taxes, this sale can sharply reduce the share price (and the market value of the company).Perhaps Professor Piketty's ideas are well-suited for Western Europe where equity concerns might be more pressing than the desire for greater economic growth. India's problem today is not one of high levels of inequality, it is one of great inefficiency. Professor Piketty’s proposal might make things better in France; in India, it will make things worse.",World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill believes there are several things going for India – from the demographics to geopolitics and from a large domestic market.

Ola Electric Mobility Ltd. announced opening of 3,200 new stores in a single day, as India’s biggest e-scooter maker seeks to expand its local footprint and address customer frustration related to shortcomings in service.The Bengaluru-based Ola Electric has increased the number of showrooms and service centers to 4,000, Ankush Aggarwal, group head of financial services and retail auto business, said at an even on Wednesday.The company, led by co-founder Bhavish Aggarwal , is looking to penetrate India’s small towns as well as bolster its after-sales service. “By leveraging its direct-to-consumer (D2C) model, Ola is ensuring that EV ownership becomes a reality for every household,” the company said in an exchange filing last week.Ola Electric’s single-day store launch blitz marks its attempts to revive its market share and reputation after a tumultuous year marked by a blockbuster listing in August followed by an onslaught of consumer complaints regulatory scrutiny and a heated spat between its chairman and a stand-up comedian.Almost every Indian town, city and district would have an Ola Electric store and a service center, its Chairman Bhavish Aggarwal said in a Dec. 19 video posted on X. The milestone was initially expected on Dec 20 but later pushed to Dec 25.The massive rollout comes a couple of months after it got slammed by service and performance-linked customer complaints. A monthly runrate of 80,000 such complaints were overwhelming its service centers, according to local media reports.Videos and photos of malfunctioning Ola Scooters circulating on social media while Aggarwal had a social media altercation with an Indian comedian, who criticized the company’s flagship model.Reputational Turnaround“Their service network is an area the company is trying to address” as it scripts a reputational turnaround, Jinesh Gandhi, analyst at Ambit Capital Pvt., told Bloomberg News.India’s heavy industry ministry ordered an audit of the firm’s servicing hubs in October, Reuters reported, and the Central Consumer Protection Authority served a notice in October over alleged violation of customer rights, misleading ads and unfair trade practices.This has led to market share loss for the sector leader — it dropped to 24.5% in November versus 32.6% in the same month last year.

Revival of 7-8% growth in focus at pre-Budget meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/revival-of-7-8-growth-in-focus-at-pre-budget-meet/articleshow/116641919.cms,"Experts stress need to step up growth

NEW DELHI: The need to get back to 7-8% growth against the backdrop of global challenges, geopolitical tensions and to ensure that the country remains on track to reach developed nation status by 2047 dominated deliberations at a meeting of economists with PM Modi Tuesday.At pre-Budget consultations under the theme - 'Maintaining India's growth momentum at a time of global uncertainty' - the PM emphasised that the 2047 goal could be achieved with changes in mindset.The PM's remark came in the context of plans needed for grabbing opportunities that may open up for the country in the wake of a possible tariff war between the US and China and how India can benefit and be part of the global value chain.Economists underlined the need to step up growth and offered suggestions on a range of issues, including employment generation , skill development, raising farm productivity, attracting investment and boosting exports.Growth has slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4% in the July-Sept quarter of the current financial year, raising alarm among policymakers and triggering calls for a cut in interest rates.The sharp slowdown in growth in the second quarter has also prompted several agencies, including RBI, to revise growth downwards. Sources said a significant part of the meeting saw experts reinforcing the need to step up growth and deepen reforms across sectors, from the farm sector to taxation reforms both on indirect and direct taxes. Economists suggested a range of reforms for the farm sector such as a robust value chain for vegetables including TOP (tomato, onion and potato). Suggestions were also made on strategies to deal with climate change and energy transition.Issues linked to trade and exports were prominently discussed, with experts suggesting several measures including faster conclusion of free trade agreements, a strategy on tariffs and internationalisation of the rupee. For creating jobs, suggestions were made to deepen vocational training and inculcating dignity of labour.An official statement issued after the meeting, which was coordinated by govt think tank Niti Aayog , said participants shared their views on several significant issues including navigating challenges posed by global economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions, strategies to enhance employment, particularly among youth, and create sustainable job opportunities across sectors, strategies to align education and training programmes with the evolving needs of the job market, enhancing agricultural productivity and creating sustainable rural employment opportunities, attracting private investment and mobilising public funds for infrastructure projects to boost economic growth , creating jobs and promoting financial inclusion, boosting exports and attracting foreign investment.FM Nirmala Sitharaman, Niti Aayog vice chairman Suman Bery, CEO BVR Subrahmanyam, and senior officials of the PMO and finance ministry attended the meeting.

This relationship stems from an old manufacturing alliance that Tatas had with Italian Fiat, which is now part of the Stellantis group.Despite having global issues with alliance partner Nissan, French company Renault churns out cars from a joint factory around Chennai. If Honda joins hands with Nissan, it will be interesting to watch how the Renault-Nissan India factory figures into the deal, considering Honda has a factory in Greater Noida (UP) and Alwar (Rajasthan).Mahindra & Mahindra is working with German Volkswagen group for components on electrics and the two companies are now in talks for a broader and more product-oriented JV.The situation is no less different in case of two-wheelers where Bajaj has partnered KTM for churning out powerful bikes. TVS Motor has a partnership with German BMW Motorrad for making 310cc motorcycles. The alliance has already spanned a decade and is expanding to other products and platforms.

What is GRAP?

Expert opinions

NEW DELHI: Every winter, as the Air Quality Index (AQI) in NCR plunges to hazardous levels, govt rolls out its Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) – a court-mandated emergency protocol to temporarily reduce air-pollution.Though well-intentioned, some provisions have been doing exactly the opposite. Causing more pollution , or the reduction in pollution—if at all—is too small compared to the havoc it causes to the public. Here is a pick of four such measures that need relook:The blanket ban on construction and demolition work under GRAP impacts thousands of daily-wage labourers, forcing many to leave the city in winter. There are nearly 13.8 lakh such workers registered in Delhi alone. As TOI has written recently, most of them do not get the compensation they are supposed to get during such bans.That aside, construction stops only in a few places and goes on blatantly in most places—e.g. thousands of home renovations or constructions. It’s beyond any law enforcement agency to identify and halt such work. What halts immediately, however, are much-needed public works like repair of badly broken but heavily used roads.traffic congestion and dust, which compounds the pollution problem. Often, some dust-emitting large govt projects remain exempt from the ban.Mandate green construction practices, instead of halting work. China, for example, is making environmentally sustainable buildings a standard by 2027. Even in 2020, green building initiatives constituted 77% of China's new urban development projects. Law enforcement agencies can do random check of construc tion sites for their adherence to green norms and seal those not in compliance. This will balance the need for pollution control with continuity of economic activities.In the name of implementing GRAP, the police places barricades across the city, which brings traffic to halt at peak hours. It causes congestion and adds to pollution. To catch a fraction of non-complaint vehicles, every vehicle is halted or slowed. The traffic policemen are compelled to inhale the same toxic air. An officer said they have an app through which they can check the registration of vehicles, and also a booklet with pictures of different vehicles and specifications to help identify the ones that are banned. But that doesn’t help.Govt agencies should ensure that owners of vehicles not supposed to be on road during GRAP receive a message on their phone. While some did receive such messages from the Delhi transport department last year, many didn’t this year. A system should be developed to identify old and banned vehicles plying on the roads through CCTV cameras and penalise them. And if such a system isn’t possible to build, stop this measure all together. The feasibility-desirability mismatch is just too high.At Delhi’s 154 entry points, green tax collection often creates bottlenecks due to manual and haphazard processes. Of these, only 11 are equipped with RFID systems, exacerbating de lays and pollution. On average, 1,05,989 commercial vehicles enter the city every day. Of this, around 70,000 vehicles are cabs.Expand RFID-based contactless systems for smooth tax collection. Create dedicated lanes for commercial and non-commercial vehicles to reduce congestion.Deployed in three shifts across the city, anti-smog guns spray water to settle dust but often obstruct traffic and waste resources. They hinder the movement of traffic by blocking one lane of busy roads during peak hours. The sights of cabs or private cars tailing smoke-guns to clean their windscreen are all too common! According to official data, 200 anti-smog guns have been deployed in the city.Assess the utility of anti-smog guns with a data-driven approach. Deploy them during non-peak hours to minimise congestion and focus, instead, on long-term dust control measures.Increasing parking fees under GRAP aims to deter private vehicles but overlooks Delhi’s glaring public transport gaps. Delhi Metro is the most preferred modes of transport, but last-mile connectivity is still a big challenge. Delhi currently has 7,683 buses, including govtrun DTC and cluster buses, but the number is significantly lower than the demand. On an average, 70 buses – both DTC and cluster – break down in the city every day, causing significant traffic congestion and inconvenience to commuters.There is no parking management plan either. In 2020, the Supreme Court had directed formulation of a comprehensive parking policy, which is nowhere in sight.Once the last-mile connectivity of metro improves, DTC buses are adequate and reliable and there is a single ticketing of all local commuting options, the use of private vehicles will come down on its own.While GRAP’s intent to curb air pollution is commendable, its execution is often devoid of ground realities. For meaningful change, Delhi needs long-term, structural reforms that address pollution at its roots rather than relying on temporary fixes that disrupt lives and livelihoods.GRAP is a set of emergency pollution-control measures ?rst formulated in 2016 and implemented from 2017 onwards under the guidance of the Supreme Court and various environmental authorities. It operates in stages, with restrictions escalating as pollution worsens.GRAP measures are short-term emergency responses, not long-term solutions. The city needs year-round actions like fleet electrification, better public transport, green construction technology, and effective waste management to eliminate the need for GRAP. —Anumita RoyChowdhury | Executive director, CSEReal estate must adopt dust-control measures and sustainable practices like prefabrication and ready-mix concrete. Anti-smog guns and mechanised sweeping vehicles should have staggered schedules to reduce congestion-induced pollution—Sunil Dahiya | Founder, Envirocatalysts","The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) is a court-mandated emergency protocol to temporarily reduce air-pollution. The ban on construction and demolition work under GRAP impacts thousands of daily-wage labourers, forcing many to leave the city in winter. Some dust-emitting large govt projects remain exempt from the ban.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116581765,imgsize-101364,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/116581765.jpg"

'Every square metre of canal belongs to Panama'

'Welcome to the United States Canal'

President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday declared his intention to regain control of the Panama Canal, calling it a ""vital national asset"" while criticising Panama's management and demanding the canal's return to US control, warning Panamanian officials to ""be guided accordingly.""Trump argued that ""we're being ripped off at the Panama Canal,"" by the current fee structure and blamed former President Jimmy Carter for ""foolishly"" ceding control of the canal nearly half a century ago. He also criticised the ""ridiculous"" charges imposed on shippers using the strategic waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.Trump stated his intention to demand the canal's return during his second term, ""If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question."" ""I'm not going to stand for it,"" Trump said.""So to the officials of Panama, please be guided accordingly,"" he added.His remarks came during his first major rally since winning the White House on November 5, drawing swift condemnation from Panama's conservative president, José Raúl Mulino. During a 75-minute speech, Trump spoke on blending policy declarations with personal triumphs, a hallmark of his style.Trump began the speech by saying that ""we want to try to bring everybody together. We're going to try. We're going to really give it a shot,"" adding that Democrats have ""lost their confidence"" and are ""befuddled"" after the election but eventually will ""come over to our side because we want to have them,"" the Associated Press reported.Panamanian president José Raúl Mulino firmly rejected Trump's demand, calling it an affront to Panama's sovereignty. Mulino, characterised as a conservative populist sharing various positions with Trump, leads a strong US ally.Following Trump's speech, Mulino released a video on X reaffirming Panama's ownership of the canal, stating that ""every square metre of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to belong"" to his country.Without naming Trump directly, Mulino addressed complaints about rising canal fees, explaining that the tariffs are determined by experts based on operational costs and supply-and-demand dynamics.""The tariffs are not set on a whim,"" Mulino said, highlighting Panama's independent efforts to expand the canal over the years to accommodate increased ship traffic, adding that fee adjustments fund these improvements.""Panamanians may have different views on many issues. But when it comes to our canal, and our sovereignty, we will all unite under our Panamanian flag,"" the Panamanian president said.In response to these comments, Trump took to his social media platform, posting, ""We'll see about that!"" alongside an image of the US flag planted in the canal zone with the caption, ""Welcome to the United States Canal!""The United States constructed the canal in the early 1900s to facilitate coastal maritime transport. The waterway's control transferred to Panama on December 31, 1999, under an agreement President Jimmy Carter signed in 1977. The canal contributes approximately one-fifth of Panama's annual government revenue.According to Associated Press, the canal's operations, dependent on reservoirs, faced significant disruption from the 2023 Central American droughts, necessitating reduced daily vessel passages. Administrators increased reservation fees due to limited availability. Despite normalised transit following improved weather conditions, fee increases are anticipated for the following year.","President-elect Donald Trump called the Panama Canal a ""vital national asset"" during his first major speech since winning the White House.

American Airlines Group Inc said a technical vendor glitch was the cause of a brief groundstop on all US flights on Christmas Eve, one of the busiest days of the holiday travel season.

Nippon Steel Corp’s proposed $12.3 billion acquisition of US Steel Corp. moved a step closer to being blocked after a US national security panel deadlocked on its review and left the final decision with President Biden, who has repeatedly indicated his opposition to the deal.

Salesforce Inc says it’s taking multiple large customers from former partner Veeva Systems Inc. in a mounting rivalry to sell software to the pharmaceutical industry.

A Starbucks Corp barista strike has shut down about 170 cafes, according to the coffee chain, disrupting service at locations nationwide during the final days of the crucial holiday shopping season.

Arcadium Lithium Plc, a chemicals company, said it obtained all shareholder approvals for a proposed acquisition by Rio Tinto Plc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9%

The MSCI World Index rose 0.9%

Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index rose 2.1%

The Russell 2000 Index rose 1%

A rally in the group that has led Wall Street ’s gains in 2024 lifted stocks in a relatively quiet session ahead of Christmas.Following a strong day for big tech, the shares continued to power ahead on Tuesday. Tesla Inc. led megacaps higher. Broadcom Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. climbed as President Joe Biden’s team launched a probe into Chinese-made chips. In a shortened pre-holiday session, the S&P 500“The action of the past few weeks shows that the big-cap tech names are still the key leadership group in today’s stock market,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak. “These big-tech names are highly overweighted in the portfolios of a huge number of institutional investors. Any buying they do over the next week is likely to be concentrated in these names.”Equity investors are also hoping for what’s known as the “Santa Claus Rally,” in which stocks rise during the final five trading sessions of a year and the first two of the new one. This time around that window started Tuesday.“Santa Claus rally could still be alive, with strong seasonality into the end of the year,” said London Stockton at Ned Davis Research.Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated average and median returns of 1.3% during this period, widely outpacing the market’s average seven-day gain of 0.3%, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.“When investors are on the ‘nice’ list, and Santa delivers a ‘positive’ Santa Claus Rallyreturn, the S&P 500 has generated an average January and forward annual return of 1.4% and 10.4%, respectively,” he said.The S&P 500 rose 1.1%. The Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%.The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.59%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index barely budged.While a positive “Santa Claus Rally” has preceded a 10.4% average annual gain for the S&P 500 since World War II, Sam Stovall at CFRA says a more accurate indicator in his view is the “January Barometer.”That’s a market hypothesis positing that January’s performance predicts the year’s performance. The term was coined by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, in 1972.Since 1945, when the year started with a gain in January, the S&P 500 rose an average of 18.3% in price during the entire year, Stovall at CFRA said. If the first month saw a decline in price, however, the average full-year return was negative 1.9%.With the market up over 25% this year and no corrections of more than 10%, the S&P 500 has managed to stay solidly above its 200-day moving average for the entirety of 2024, noted Bespoke Investment Group strategists.“Barring a significant market selloff in the last few trading days of the year, this will be the 12th year since 1952 (when we went to the current 5-day trading week at the NYSE) that the S&P has traded above its 200-DMA all year,” they said.The average next-year change following these years has been a gain of just 4.6% compared to the average gain of 9.2% for all years, Bespoke noted.Last week, Bank of America Corp. clients were large net buyers of US equities, according to strategist Jill Carey Hall. They bought American shares for the seventh consecutive week.Similar to the prior five weeks, clients bought both single stocks and exchange-traded funds, with bigger inflows into the former, she noted. Flows were primarily in large caps.Investors should have a more-balanced approach in US stocks over the first quarter, according to Citigroup Inc. strategists led by Scott Chronert, who see a greater opportunity in defensive sectors.They raised health care to overweight, noting valuations are now lower and fundamentals seem close to inflection point. Meantime, they are selective on growth stocks, looking for stronger fundamental trend versus valuation and potential margin improvement.Citi’s strategists are overweight in media, internet and semiconductors, while raising software to market weight.",The S&P 500 rose 1.1%.

The battle of the top performing L1 blockchains has been pretty wild this year, with the likes of ETH, SOL, TRX, BNB, Toncoin (TON) and Cardano (ADA) fighting to claim the leadership mantle. However, out of all these networks, TON blockchain is showing huge promise as it records approximately 200% gains.Conversely, Cardano network is also making waves, especially as its new Hydra scalability solution is set to potentially unlock 1 million TPS. On the other hand, predictions about a fast-rising presale star– Lunex Network (LNEX) are blowing up as it shows the potential of overthrowing TON and ADA in 2025.Over the past year and counting, TON blockchain has been widely popular for one major thing— blockchain lucrative games. The partnership between Toncoin and Telegram to bring mini-games to millions of users was a very profitable one.From launching several tap-to-earn games to furthering its expansion in P2E games, Toncoin has been able to rack up approximately 200% NET gains . As experts rank Toncoin (TON) alongside cryptos to buy , analysts are starting to give bullish predictions.Although TON price is currently down by 11% as it trades within a weekly range of $6.6 and $5.9, the network is still receiving positive sentiment. X aanalyst, Crypto King particularly sighted a short term prediction of $10 for Toncoin. While this may seem far-fetched from the current price, the token’s 50, 100, and 200 moving averages points at a strong buy.Since its founder, Charles Hoskinson met up with President Donald Trump for the sake of enhancing crypto adoption, Cardano has been buzzing alongside otherDeFi coins . Cardano price now sits at a weekly range of $$0.98 and $1.28, 70% jump from its price in the past month. However experts believe this is just the starting.During a recent Cardano market dip, whales took the opportunity to accumulate 130 million ADA token, signaling huge bullish sentiment and strong confidence. Owing to this several investors are positive for Cardano network.Ali Martinez, a seasoned crypto analyst and expert has sparked more optimism recently. In a very recent tweet. Ali emphasized on how he will keep buying ADA even if it dips to $0.7 as he expects a further surge to $4 or $6 for Cardano.As a fast, secure and non-custodial DeFi project with robust features to facilitate effortless cross chain transactions, it won’t be surprising for Lunex Network (LNEX) to challenge top DeFi coins. The new altcoin project has already accumulated over $5.4 million in revenue after selling over 2.3 billion of its presale supply. Such buying interest only speaks of its potential to deliver immeasurable returns when it launches on DEX platforms.However, asides the numbers, Lunex Network has more growth potential embedded in its ecosystem and practical use. For starters, the platform allows investors to swap up to 50,000 cryptocurrencies across multi chains by connecting isolated blockchains together. Additionally, users can invest in its LNEX tokens and earn up to 18% APY in passive income when they engage in its staking pool.Furthermore, there’s a reward system where the platform gives half of its revenue to users while preserving the other half for more exclusive rewards. Alongside this, Lunex Network helps investors track their portfolio while delivering updated market insights. The platform also grants cashback rewards on every transaction, allowing users to earn more by actively using the network. With over 300% spike, its LNEX token is now valued at $0.0048 from an initial $0.0012.The practical uses and diversity that Lunex Network brings as an exchange platform is enough to contend with the likes of Toncoin. Although TON has seen huge developments as a mothering network to several other cryptocurrencies, Lunex Network’s intricate design catered for crypto investors, business owners and Web3 development makes it stand out as a tough contender. This put LNEX token on the radar of top cryptos to buy.You can find more information about Lunex Network (LNEX) here:Website: https://lunexnetwork.com Socials: https://linktr.ee/lunexnetwork","Lunex Network (LNEX) is primed for a staggering growth above most DeFi coins.

The three combining companies would collectively manufacture approximately 8 million vehicles. During 2023, Honda manufactured 4 million units, Nissan 3.4 million, and Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.Earlier in August, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced their intention to join hands on electric vehicle components and autonomous driving software research, following an initial agreement between Nissan and Honda in March.Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions said that Honda could benefit from Nissan's truck-based SUVs like the Armada and Infiniti QX80, while gaining from Nissan's expertise in battery technology, electric vehicles and hybrid powertrains.Earlier, Nissan announced layoffs affecting 9,000 staff globally in November, alongside a 20% reduction in production capacity, after reporting losses of 9.3 billion yen.

The govt then asked the judge to force Google to sell Chrome, the world's most popular browser, among other remedies.In Google's own proposal to fix the search monopoly, it asked Mehta to allow it to continue to pay other companies for its search engine to get prime placement.

It was the sort of physical media expected to die in the internet era, and indeed, the encyclopedia's publisher announced that it was ending the print edition in 2012. Skeptics wondered how Britannica the company could survive in the age of Wikipedia.

The company says its websites draw over 7 billion annual page views a year, with users in more than 150 countries.Britannica has come far from its origins in the 18th century as the publisher of a reference work put together by three Scottish printers. Over the years, the Encyclopaedia Britannica became a heavyweight of the knowledge business, both literally - the 32-volume 2010 edition, the last to run in print, weighed 129 pounds - and figuratively, drawing on contributions from thousands of experts. It also became an aspirational status symbol, with customers paying nearly $1,400 for that edition.By the time the last Encyclopaedia Britannica was printed, the company had already started its suite of websites and educational software. Now it sees even greater opportunity in the growth of generative AI tools , which the company says can help make learning more dynamic - and therefore more desirable.Cauz said Britannica had experimented with the technology over the past few decades. It acquired Melingo, the company that makes its AI agent software, in 2000 because of its strength in natural language processing and machine learning. And it has two technology teams, based in Chicago and in Tel Aviv.The vertiginous popularity of chatbots like ChatGPT convinced executives that they needed to invest more in the space. Britannica now uses AI in creating, fact-checking and translating content for its products, including the online encyclopedia. It also created a Britannica chatbot that draws on its online encyclopedia's stores of information, which Cauz said was more likely to be accurate than the more generalised chatbots that could be prone to ""hallucinations.""The firm has more projects powered by generative AI in the pipeline: an English-language tutoring software that will use the tech to power avatars and customise lessons for each student, a program to help teachers create lesson plans, and a revamped thesaurus for the Merriam-Webster website that can handle phrases, not just words.","Britannica Group runs websites, including Britannica.com and the online Merriam- Webster dictionary, and sells educational software to schools and libraries.

Bond yields climb, stock market feels the squeeze

Winners and losers on Wall Street

Global markets and economic uncertainty

Economic outlook clouds amid inflation and political shifts

US stock markets endured one of their most severe declines of the year on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled a shift in its monetary policy trajectory. The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, narrowly missing its largest loss of 2024, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by 1,123 points, or 2.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite suffered the worst drop, declining 3.6%.The central bank announced its third rate cut of the year, lowering its main interest rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. However, it was the Fed’s updated projections for 2025 that rattled investors: Policymakers now anticipate only two additional cuts next year, down from four projected just three months ago.“We are in a new phase of the process,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, explaining the tempered outlook as a response to robust job market performance, rising inflation readings, and economic uncertainties, including the upcoming Trump administration’s policies.Treasury yields surged following the Fed's announcement, exerting additional pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.51% from 4.40%, while the two-year yield, more sensitive to Fed actions, increased to 4.35% from 4.25%.Higher yields typically hurt stock valuations, particularly for companies reliant on borrowing to drive growth. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies tumbled 4.4%, reflecting the acute impact of rising interest rates on smaller-cap stocks.“We’re seeing the market recalibrate for a ‘higher for longer’ rate environment,” said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research. “The Fed’s announcement caught investors off guard, eroding confidence in the expected pace of rate reductions.”Among individual stocks, General Mills fell 3.1% despite better-than-expected quarterly profits, as its lowered profit forecast for the year spooked investors. Nvidia, a significant driver of this year’s market rally, dropped 1.1%, extending its losses to over 13% since its record high last month.Conversely, Jabil surged 7.3% after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and raising its full-year revenue forecast.Global markets displayed mixed reactions. In London, the FTSE 100 rose marginally by less than 0.1%, buoyed by data showing UK inflation at an eight-month high. The Bank of England is expected to keep rates unchanged when it announces its decision on Thursday.Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.7%, even as Nissan shares jumped 23.7% on reports of potential collaboration with Honda. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Motors, partly owned by Nissan, saw its shares soar nearly 20%.Powell noted that while rate cuts could stimulate economic growth, they also risk exacerbating inflation. “When the path is uncertain, you go a little slower,” he said, likening the Fed’s approach to navigating a foggy night.Lingering inflationary pressures and the transition to the Trump administration have introduced additional variables into the Fed’s calculus. Powell acknowledged that some officials are already weighing the implications of potential fiscal policy changes, including tariffs and spending initiatives.Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack was the lone dissenter in Wednesday’s decision, arguing against the rate cut.As Wall Street digests the Fed’s outlook, concerns grow that the anticipated “Santa Claus rally” may be replaced by further volatility, with analysts suggesting that traders may lock in profits amid uncertainty.(With inputs from agencies)","The S&P 500 fell 2.9%, narrowly missing its largest loss of 2024.

US Federal Reserve cuts interest rate by 25 basis points in key FOMC meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rate-by-25-basis-points-in-key-fomc-meet/articleshow/116445969.cms,"Recent economic indicators, including Tuesday's robust November retail sales data, align with the Federal Reserve's assessment of a strong economy.

The US Federal Reserve cut the interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, according to an official statement following the key FOMC meeting. This 25 basis points cut has led to the central banks benchmark policy rate being in the 4.25% to 4.50% range. This represents a decrease of one full percentage point from its September level, when the Fed initiated the relaxation of stringent monetary measures implemented to address the inflation spike that commenced in 2021.The US central bank modified a crucial component of its interest rate management system on Wednesday by reducing the reverse repo facility rate more significantly than the federal funds rate reduction. The reverse repo rate has been decreased by 30 basis points to 4.25% from its previous 4.55%.Market specialists suggest this anticipated adjustment represents the Federal Reserve's effort to encourage the movement of funds away from a facility that is commonly regarded as an indicator of surplus liquidity within the financial framework.The overnight reverse repo facility (ONRPP) rate, which the Federal Reserve offers, enables money market funds and other entities to deposit funds with the central bank through what essentially amounts to a secured loan. This ONRPP rate functions to establish a flexible lower boundary for all short-term interest rates.""In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,"" the FOMC statement read.""In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments,"" the statement added.Recent economic indicators, including Tuesday's robust November retail sales data, align with the Federal Reserve's assessment of a strong economy marked by strong growth, minimal unemployment, and gradually declining, yet persistently elevated inflation levels.KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk in her pre-meeting analysis said, ""Debate will be heated,"" she said. ""The economy remains stronger than participants at the meeting thought it would be when they started cutting in September, while improvements in inflation appear to have stalled ... The Fed is going to want time to pause to see where we are and how policy may shift after the president-elect is sworn in.""Following Trump's inauguration on January 20, the Fed's subsequent meeting occurs on January 28-29. A Reuters survey indicates that 58 out of 99 economists anticipate the central bank will maintain current rates during this meeting, allowing time to evaluate economic developments.","The US Federal Reserve cut the interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday.

"Amazon’s cloud unit bets on new models, chips to catch up in AI race",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazons-cloud-unit-bets-on-new-models-chips-to-catch-up-in-ai-race/articleshow/116444528.cms,"(The writer was in Las Vegas at invitation of AWS)

LAS VEGAS: Amazon’s cloud unit AWS unveiled new AI models and chips to take on rivals like Microsoft, which has had an edge due to its ties with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.Exactly two years ago, the launch of ChatGPT forced tech giants to redraw plans, wiping out billions from market caps of companies that were slow to adapt. AWS, which pioneered renting out data infrastructure, was seen to be losing grip on its cloud dominance over the past two years amid the AI boom.However, Andy Jassy, who built AWS before succeeding Jeff Bezos as Amazon CEO in 2021, sees it differently. “When we talk about AI, it is typically less to announce that we have beat the best chess player in the world... We are not using AI because we think it is cool. We are using it because we are trying to solve customer problems,” Jassy said at AWS’s annual tech event re:Invent in Las Vegas last week. AWS has sought to embed AI into its services and push customers to bring more of their applications by offering them a wide choice of AI models and chips, including its in-house ones, through its Bedrock platform.“With the announcement of Nova, we have made it clear that we want to compete... Whether it’s chips or models, we will be very competitive on costs,” Sherry Marcus, director of applied science (GenAI) at AWS, told TOI. Nova, which launched last week, is AWS’s answer to AI foundation models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Essentially, these are machine learning models trained on vast datasets and designed to produce a range of outputs, including chatbots.AI-related capabilities dominated AWS’s announcements at the cloud conference. The company unveiled AI semiconductor Trainium2 which is expected to chip away at Nvidia ’s stranglehold by reducing customer costs. AWS unveiled Apple as one of its newest chip customers. It also announced an ‘ultracluster’ — which aims to provide supercomputer-like computing power to let customers train their AI models using multiple chips. It will also enable Anthropic, an AI startup into which Amazon has poured $8 billion, to train its Claude models and take on Microsoft-backed OpenAI.According to analysts, rapid tech development means that no company has a moat, and breakthroughs are quickly adopted by other companies. In such a scenario, the key challenge will be to retain customers who may find it increasingly easy to switch vendors amid antitrust scrutiny.“Customers are driven by cost, accuracy & latency (data transfer delay)... (AI) models are becoming more of a commodity. It’s not like two years ago, where you’ll be chasing the new shiny star,” AWS’s Marcus said.AWS is also betting on AI startups in the early stages by offering millions of dollars worth of credits for its cloud services.AWS head of startups (Asia-Pacific & Japan) Tiffany Bloomquist told TOI: “In India, in addition to Mumbai and Bangalore, I went to Coimbatore... Even in tier-2 cities, developers are seeing AI as a critical new enabler to disrupt traditional technologies they operate in.”Analysts say that even as Microsoft has gained AI market share, AWS has brought potential solutions with its new launches.“AWS has the edge with machine learning workloads and customers, which should be easy to move to GenAI,” Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said. “The AI race is a marathon, not a sprint.”",AWS has sought to embed AI into its services and push customers to bring more of their applications.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
E-commerce firm Udaan raises $340 million ahead of planned IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/e-commerce-firm-udaan-raises-340-million-ahead-of-planned-ipo/articleshow/105991030.cms,"Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.","Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.

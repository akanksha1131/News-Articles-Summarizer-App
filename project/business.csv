‘False’ FASTag wallet toll deduction? Here’s what NHAI is doing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/false-fastag-wallet-toll-deduction-heres-what-nhai-is-doing/articleshow/118677800.cms,"FASTag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home.

‘False FASTag toll deduction ’: The National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) has taken strict action against incorrect FASTag wallet deductions, penalising toll collectors in approximately 250 instances.FASTag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home or haven't crossed toll plazas. Officials attribute this to toll operators' errors in vehicle number entry, particularly when FASTag becomes unreadable, or when individuals carry tags in their wallets.IHMCL , the highways authority's toll management body, now levies a Rs 1 lakh fine per violation in such cases. According to a TOI report , this substantial penalty has resulted in a 70% reduction in such incidents.Currently, IHMCL receives about 50 legitimate complaints monthly, compared to 30 crore FASTag transactions across national highway toll plazas.Users have reported false toll deductions on social media platforms and through formal complaints to IHMCL. ""Customers facing false deductions can file a complaint by calling 1033 or emailing falsededuction@ihmcl.com and each case is thoroughly investigated. And if the complaint of such deduction or incorrect manual transactions is established, chargebacks are issued to the customer immediately. Additionally, a Rs 1 lakh penalty is imposed on the toll operator responsible,"" said a senior IHMCL official.Also Read | Turnaround from importer to exporter!

The system facilitates automatic toll fee deductions from a connected prepaid account, which users can control via FASTag applications. This electronic tag, attached to the vehicle's windscreen, establishes communication with toll plaza scanning equipment.NHAI implemented FASTag, making it compulsory for all vehicles. This electronic toll collection system has transformed toll payments across India by significantly reducing queue times, decreasing fuel usage, and minimising person-to-person contact at toll booths.","FASTag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home or haven't crossed toll plazas.

RBI takes note! How overseas students are being used by wealthy parents to stash money abroad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-takes-note-how-overseas-students-are-being-used-by-wealthy-parents-to-stash-money-abroad/articleshow/118701594.cms,"RBI's 2003 regulation granted 'non-resident Indian' (NRI) status to overseas students. (AI image)

Course correction

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is reportedly examining the utilisation of a two-decade-old foreign exchange regulation that was initially established to assist Indian students studying abroad. Students have been quietly facilitating international money transfers for years, a practice that is now gaining attention.The central bank's 2003 regulation granted 'non-resident Indian' (NRI) status to overseas students. This measure was primarily implemented to support students who sought employment abroad to fund their education. Previously, these students were classified as 'residents'. The change aimed to protect working students from inadvertently violating the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) of 2000, which required residents to repatriate their foreign earnings.According to an ET report, affluent Indian families realised that their children's NRI status could serve as an avenue for substantial international fund transfers, an option not available to 'resident' parents under existing regulations.""Once a person is treated as a non-resident under FEMA, he is entitled to freely repatriate all current income in India and all capital sums up to $1 million every financial year from his NRO bank account... compared to a resident who can remit only $250,000. If RBI is considering reviewing this circular, it may be worthwhile for the regulator to draw a distinction for those students who go for long-duration courses, say, more than 4 years. Such persons could continue to be classified as non-residents under FEMA,"" Anup P. Shah, partner of the CA firm Pravin P. Shah & Company, was quoted as saying.Various tax and FEMA experts who spoke with the financial daily indicated that RBI might review the circular to establish clear guidelines between legitimate students with overseas part-time employment and those seeking NRI status solely for fund transfers abroad.Also Read | Turnaround from importer to exporter! India now shipping Apple product components to China & Vietnam Moin Ladha, partner at Khaitan & Co, explains, ""The primary criteria for determining residency is an individual's intention to leave India for an uncertain period."" He notes the distinction between long-term university students and those attending brief courses. ""The regulators or the government may be seeking to clarify this distinction to prevent the misuse of enhanced financial limits available to NRIs by students enrolling in short-term programs without the intention or ability to secure employment or remain abroad.""Some observers suggest that substantial fund transfers might have been integral to the strategy of affluent families choosing overseas relocation and foreign citizenship. Current regulations permit previously transferred or received funds to remain abroad, even if the student later returns to establish residency in India.Also Read | Taxpayers take note!

Shah, partner at Jayantilal Thakkar & Company, a firm specialising in tax and FEMA matters, states, ""The 2003 circular on students becoming NRIs was issued a year RBI allowed LRS. Now after 22 years, it is crystal clear that RBI considers such students as NRIs. However, students should keep in mind the intention of RBI behind the circular rather than using it for the ultimate benefit of their families. RBI may intervene to restrict use of such circular if they deem fit.""",RBI's 2003 regulation granted 'non-resident Indian' (NRI) status to overseas students.

LIC Portfolio takes a hit

Stock market crash impact: Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), the country’s largest domestic institutional investor, has experienced a substantial decline of Rs 1.45 lakh crore in its equity portfolio value within two months of 2025. The value decreased from Rs 14.9 lakh crore in December 2024 to Rs 13.4 lakh crore by February's end, representing one of the most significant mark-to-market losses in its recent history for its diverse 310-stock portfolio.According to an ET analysis, the severe decline in LIC's investments directly correlates with the overall market crash, particularly affecting small and mid-cap shares, which have experienced their most significant decline since the COVID-19 crisis. Large-cap shares, where LIC maintains considerable investments, have also experienced substantial losses.ITC, LIC's second-largest equity investment, has contributed significantly to the portfolio's decline, with an 18% decrease resulting in approximately Rs 17,000 crore value reduction. Technology companies TCS and Infosys, where LIC maintains 4.75% and 10.58% ownership respectively, have declined, reducing the portfolio value by Rs 10,509 crore and Rs 7,640 crore, according to ACE Equity data.In the banking sector, LIC's substantial investments in SBI (9.13% stake) and ICICI Bank (7.14% stake) decreased by Rs 8,568 crore and Rs 3,179 crore respectively.

NEW DELHI: Traditional incentives like salary seem to have become less significant this year for Indian employees as workplace flexibility, job security, opportunities for learning and development and sense of belonging take centre stage, according to talent firm Randstad.Last year, employees prioritised work-life balance, followed by remuneration and job security. According to Randstad India's Workmonitor 2025 survey, 52 per cent of the Indian workforce would leave a job if it lacked sufficient flexibility, compared to 31 per cent globally. Flexibility continues to be a key decision-making factor, with 60 per cent of employees rejecting a job without flexible working hours and 56 per cent declining roles lacking flexibility in work locations, the survey added.The findings indicate that employees are increasingly prioritising work that resonates with their personal values and life goals, moving beyond financial incentives. Job security, mental health support, and work-life balance now hold more significance. In fact, pay has dropped to the fourth spot, reflecting a shift toward a more holistic view of employment.Further, the demand for flexible working hours is significantly higher across all generations in India compared to the global average due to unique socio-economic and workplace dynamics.Viswanath PS, MD & CEO, Randstad India, said, ""The generational divide in Indian workplace expectations is narrowing, and the data is clear - flexibility is no longer a benefit; it's a baseline expectation across all age groups. Whether it's Gen Z entering the workforce, millennials balancing career growth with personal commitments or Gen X in leadership roles, everyone values the ability to work on their own terms. This shift signals a fundamental change for organizations - flexibility must be embedded into work design, not treated as a perk. Equally, the demand for continuous learning highlights that talent isn't just looking for jobs - they are looking for careers that evolve with them.""Gen Z (62 per cent vs 45 per cent globally) received flexible working hours as they enter a digital-first job market where long commutes, cultural expectations around family involvement and high job competition make work-life balance essential.","Last year, employees prioritised work-life balance, followed by remuneration and job security.

Musk vs telcos: Local players seek ‘comparable’ spectrum prices for satcom cos to avoid biz loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/musk-vs-telcos-local-players-seek-comparable-spectrum-prices-for-satcom-cos-to-avoid-biz-loss/articleshow/118716291.cms,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of the govt decision over American Starlink ’s satcom license and mobile airwaves allotment, local telecom giants Reliance Jio and Airtel have petitioned the govt to ensure “fair competition” in the sector and mandate “comparable” spectrum prices for the Elon Musk-run company in order to tackle “market distortions”.The representation by the Indian telecom giants, reviewed by TOI, accuses regulator Trai of “overlooking the need for a level-playing field” between satellite and terrestrial spectrum assignments.“Comparable spectrum pricing to terrestrial services should be enforced for competing satellite services in urban/semi-urban/rural areas for retail/enterprise customers,” the petition by the local telcos says. “The ‘same service, same rules’ principle is essential for fair competition, requiring satellite operators offering similar services to adhere to the same spectrum pricing, regulatory levies, and fees as terrestrial operators.”While the new telecom law, passed in December 2023, had stipulated that spectrum to satcom players be allotted administratively on payment of a fee (against auctions for terrestrial makers), the allotment prices and other modalities are currently being worked upon by Trai.“Spectrum allotment rules must address the competing nature and market distortions introduced by LEO (low-earth orbit) mega constellations to ensure level-playing field with existing satellite and terrestrial operators,” the representation said.However, the telcos said that administrative assignments of spectrum with “nominal pricing” should apply for “non-competing use cases” in govt functions, disaster recovery, cellular backhaul, and sectors like defence, maritime, and aviation.The local operators, who have already received satcom license from govt but await spectrum allotment, claimed that the low-earth satellite solutions are developing mega constellations that can offer broadband speeds and capacity comparable to terrestrial networks.“Given the oversupply of broadband capacity that these entities are bringing to market, they will distort competition of terrestrial broadband, especially in urban/semi-urban areas serving retail/enterprise customers.”The companies said that globally the business model of LEO mega-constellations has been to create “oversupply” of broadband capacity.However, despite demands by telcos, Govt has been steadfast in its decision to allot satcom spectrum administratively, without auctions. Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has maintained that satcom spectrum cannot be auctioned due to technological constraints.“Please understand that technologically there's a big difference between spectrum that is meant for terrestrial networks and spectrum that's allocated to satellite-based, non-terrestrial networks. As far as terrestrial networks are concerned, you can allocate frequencies exclusively which can’t be used by others… that spectrum cannot be allocated to a single entity. It is shared. How do you auction something that's shared? You can't,” he has said.Musk’s application for satcom license is still pending with govt over issues of security clearances.

The impact was felt on Dalal Street too as the sensex closed below the 73,000 mark, while Nifty fell for the 10th consecutive session - its longest losing streak.The rupee gained two paise to close at 87.3 against the dollar. Safe haven investments like the Swiss franc and the yen posted strong gains. Gold climbed above $2,920 an ounce. On MCX, gold contracts for April delivery increased by Rs 806 to Rs 86,190 per 10 grams.The tariffs also saw oil prices drop with Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropping below $70 a barrel for the first time since Oct - sliding more than 2%.While it opens the doors for Indian oil retailers to cut prices, govt has not given them the green signal for months, helping them pocket all the gains and share some of it with the Centre in the form of higher dividend and taxes.From Tokyo to New York, equities were hit. In mid-session, all the three indices on Wall Street - Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S& - were down nearly 2% each.The sensex closed 96 points lower at 72,990, recovering from the lows of 72,634, while Nifty dropped 37 point to 22,083 points. Foreign funds continued to be net sellers at about Rs 3,500 crore.","The sensex closed 96 points lower at 72,990, recovering from the lows of 72,634, while Nifty dropped 37 point to 22,083 points.

Oil ministry slaps $2.8 billion demand on RIL-BP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/oil-ministry-slaps-2-8-billion-demand-on-ril-bp/articleshow/118717175.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: The oil ministry has slapped a demand for $2.8 billion on Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries and its partner BP operating the KG-D6 block off the Andhra coast, even as the consortium prepares to challenge a Delhi high court order upholding the government's claim in a decade-old battle that has come to be known as the 'gas siphon case'.The ministry sent the notice on Monday, days after a division bench of the high court last month quashed an earlier single-judge order that had upheld an international arbitration award in RIL-BP's favour and rejected the govt's claim.The case began in 2014 when state-run ONGC moved court, alleging RIL-BP was extracting gas that had migrated from its IG and KG-DWN-98/2 blocks adjacent to the KG-D6 block.Soon thereafter, the ministry raised a demand of $1.6 billion in cost, including interest, and $175 million as additional cumulative 'profit petroleum' payable till March 31, 2016, for what an independent committee under retired Delhi HC chief justice A P Shah described as RIL-BP's ""unjust enrichment"" by producing the migrated gas.The consortium launched an arbitration against the claim. The govt in 2018 approached the Delhi High Court after the arbitration panel rejected the charge of unjust enrichment by RIL-BP and struck down its claim.A single-judge bench of justice Anup Jairam Bhambani on May 9, 2023 upheld the arbitration award and rejected govt's claim.Last month, the division bench of justices Rekha Palli and Saurabh Banerjee quashed that order and rejected the international arbitration tribunal's ruling in favour of RIL-BP.The consortium, however, does not see any immediate liability arising from the ministry's demand note since it is challenging the latest Delhi High Court order in the Supreme Court, the company said in a stock exchange filing on Tuesday.Originally, Reliance held 60% interest in Krishna Godavari basin deep-sea block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6, while BP had 30% and Canadian firm Niko held the remaining 10%. Subsequently, Reliance and BP took over Niko's interest in the production sharing contract (PSC) and now hold 67% and 33%, respectively.","The ministry sent the notice on Monday, days after a division bench of the high court last month quashed an earlier single-judge order.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra minister Dhananjay Munde resigned from the Devendra Fadnavis cabinet on Tuesday after the chief minister called for his resignation over allegations linking his close associate, Walmik Karad, to the murder of Beed sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh.""Dhananjay Munde submitted his resignation today, which I have accepted and forwarded to the governor for further action,"" said Fadnavis.Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray strongly criticized the state government, stating that merely resigning from a ministerial post is not a solution to the ongoing crisis. He called for the dismissal of the entire government, citing a deteriorating law and order situation in Maharashtra.""Resignation is not the solution. This government should be dismissed. The law and order situation is terrible. No one is safe here,"" said Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray.After tendering his resignation as a Maharashtra minister, NCP leader Dhananjay Munde tweets,""My firm demand from the very first day has been that the accused in the brutal murder of Santosh Deshmukh from Massajog in Beed district should receive the harshest possible punishment. Seeing the photos that came up yesterday has deeply pained my heart. The investigation of this case has been completed, and the chargesheet has been filed in the court. Additionally, a judicial inquiry has also been proposed. Recalling my sense of discernment and considering that my health has not been well for the past few days, the doctors have advised me to undergo treatment for the next few days. Therefore, for medical reasons as well, I have submitted my resignation from my ministerial position in the cabinet to the chief minister.""Sources revealed that on Monday night, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had discussions with Fadnavis about the implications of the Crime Investigation Department’s (CID) chargesheet. The chargesheet, which outlines the details of the murder case and two related incidents, names Karad as the primary accused.Santosh Deshmukh's brother, Dhananjay Deshmukh, addresses the media following Dhananjay Munde's resignation as Maharashtra minister.Munde, who served as the state’s food and civil supplies minister and represented the Parli constituency in Beed district as an NCP MLA, was also the guardian minister for Beed before the reshuffle.Currently, Ajit Pawar oversees both Beed and Pune districts in this role.The case centers around the abduction, torture, and murder of Santosh Deshmukh, the sarpanch of Massajog village in Beed, on December 9 last year. Investigations suggest that Deshmukh was targeted for opposing extortion attempts tied to an energy company operating in the district.On February 27, the CID submitted a 1,200-page chargesheet to the Beed district court, which covers Deshmukh’s murder and two related incidents. The Kej police station in Beed has registered three separate cases linked to the incident—Deshmukh’s murder, an attempted extortion by Avaada Energy Company, and an assault on the company's security guard.The authorities invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against the accused, with seven individuals arrested under MCOCA provisions, while one suspect remains at large.Union minister of state Ramdas Athawale, whose Republican Party of India (RPI) is an NDA ally, also stated that while Dhananjay Munde may not be directly involved in the murder, he should resign on moral grounds. Athawale, speaking in Nashik on Sunday, noted that Valmik Karad, the prime accused in the case, has close ties to Munde. Athawale also highlighted that the CID has confirmed Karad’s involvement in the murder.Dhananjay Munde, 49, is a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Ajit Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), representing the Parli constituency in Beed. He is the nephew of late BJP veteran Gopinath Munde and the cousin of Maharashtra minister Pankaja Munde.Munde joined the NCP in 2013 and later aligned with Ajit Pawar when the party split in 2023. He had previously served as the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council and held a ministerial position in the Uddhav Thackeray-led government.","Dhananjay Munde resigned from the Devendra Fadnavis cabinet on Tuesday.

The commerce ministry stated these tariffs will take effect on 10 March, following President Donald Trump’s decision to increase tariffs on Chinese imports to 20%. The new measures apply a 15% tariff on US-grown chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton, while soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruit, vegetables, and dairy products will face an additional 10% duty.Additionally, Beijing has placed ten more US firms on its unreliable entity list, barring them from engaging in China-related trade and investment. The companies affected include Teledyne Brown Engineering, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Cubic Corporation, and ACT1 Federal. Senior executives from these firms will also be banned from entering China, and their work permits and residency privileges will be revoked. China’s Commerce Ministry cited arms sales to Taiwan as the reason for these measures.Last month, China had added PVH Group and Illumina to the same list, and it has now expanded restrictions further by adding 15 more US firms to its export control list. These include General Dynamics Land Systems and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, among others, effectively cutting them off from receiving dual-use exports.China remains a major importer of US farm products, though purchases dropped after Trump initiated a trade war. In 2021-22, US farm exports to China reached record highs, totalling $33.8 billion in 2023. However, China has been diversifying its agricultural imports, increasing purchases from Brazil and Argentina.Meanwhile, Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico also came into effect, taxing imports at 25%, with Canadian energy products subject to 10% duties. Canada has responded by imposing 25% tariffs on $107 billion worth of American goods, with immediate action on $21 billion of them.

In an escalation of the trade-war between US and China, Beijing announced it will impose new tariffs on a range of agricultural imports from the United States, effective next week. This came hours after US President Donald Trump announced increased tariffs against China.The tariffs, as outlined by China's finance ministry, will see an additional 15% tax on imports such as chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton. A 10% tariff will also be levied on a range of other products, including sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy.Also read: US markets tumble as Trump confirms tariffs on Canada, Mexico “China has decided to include 15 US entities that endanger China’s national security and interests in the export control list, prohibiting the export of dual-use items to them,” China's commerce ministry said.The US has been increasing tariffs on several countries, including China, in an ongoing trade dispute.

Economists warn that the trade war could raise consumer prices and stifle economic growth. The Tax Foundation has estimated that the current tariffs could reduce US economic output by 0.1%.While Trump has argued that tariffs are a tool to address long-standing trade imbalances and protect American workers, critics, including former US officials and economists, caution that these measures could backfire, leading to higher costs and potential job losses.","Beijing announced it will impose new tariffs on a range of agricultural imports from the United States, effective next week.

Trump’s justification

Buffett’s market moves and long-term outlook

President Donald Trump ’s latest round of tariffs on major US trading partners has sparked concerns about inflation and economic disruption , with legendary investor Warren Buffett weighing in on the potential fallout.In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Buffett called tariffs “an act of war, to some degree,” drawing from decades of experience in the global economy. The billionaire investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway warned that tariffs function as a tax on goods, ultimately leading to higher prices for consumers.“The Tooth Fairy doesn’t pay ‘em!” Buffett quipped during the interview, emphasizing that the financial burden of tariffs will fall on consumers.Buffett’s remarks come as Trump moves forward with imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, effective Tuesday. The administration has also announced an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20%, a move that is likely to escalate tensions with Beijing. In response, China has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs, raising concerns of a renewed trade war .Economists widely agree that tariffs disrupt international trade and lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers. The Trump administration has presented tariffs as a tool to pressure foreign governments and boost domestic manufacturing, but critics warn that such policies could backfire, especially given the deeply integrated supply chains across North America.Trump’s tariff announcement sent financial markets into turmoil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 649 points (1.48%), while the S&P 500 dropped 1.76% and the Nasdaq fell 2.64%. Automaker stocks took a significant hit, with General Motors declining 4% and Ford down 1.7% due to their manufacturing dependencies in Mexico.The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar also declined in response to the news, while officials in both countries signaled that they were preparing countermeasures. Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly criticized Trump’s move, calling it “unpredictable and chaotic.”Trump defended the tariffs at a White House event, arguing that they would encourage companies to move production to the U.S. “They’re going to have to have a tariff. So what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs,” he said.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick dismissed Buffett’s concerns, calling them “silly” in an interview on CNN’s The Situation Room. Lutnick went further, suggesting that tariffs could replace the need for the Internal Revenue Service, falsely claiming that the IRS was created when the US entered World War I. In reality, the IRS was established in 1862 during the Civil War, and the modern federal income tax was introduced in 1913.Despite the administration’s claims, experts argue that shifting government revenue away from income taxes to tariffs would be impractical, given the complexity and scale of the modern US economy.Buffett has historically been critical of tariffs, calling Trump’s past trade policies “a very bad idea.” His recent actions in the financial markets suggest caution about the economic outlook. Over the past year, Berkshire Hathaway has significantly increased its cash reserves, reaching a record $334.2 billion in the fourth quarter while selling off shares of major companies like Apple and Bank of America.Although Buffett refrained from directly commenting on the economy in his CBS interview, he described it as “the most interesting subject in the world.”Berkshire Hathaway’s stock has reached record highs, with both Class A and Class B shares surging. However, Buffett’s conservative investment approach has raised speculation that he is preparing for economic uncertainty.(With inputs from agencies)","Warren Buffett calls tariffs “an act of war, to some degree,” drawing from decades of experience in the global economy.

What’s next

US stocks fell sharply on Monday, wiping out much of their gains since President Donald Trump ’s election, after he announced that tariffs on Canada and Mexico would take effect within hours.The S&P 500 dropped 1.8% following Trump's statement that there was ""no room left"" for negotiations to lower the tariffs, which will begin Tuesday. The move dashed Wall Street 's hopes for a softer trade policy.Monday’s losses cut the S&P 500’s post-Election Day gains to just over 1%, down from a peak of more than 6%. The market had rallied on hopes that Trump’s policies would strengthen the economy, but recent trade tensions and economic data have raised fears of a slowdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 649 points, or 1.5%, while the Nasdaq composite slumped 2.6%.The market decline came amid broader concerns about US economic growth. A report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday showed that manufacturing activity remained in expansion but at a slower pace than economists expected. More concerningly, manufacturers saw a contraction in new orders, while prices rose amid discussions over who will bear the cost of Trump’s tariffs.Timothy Fiore, chair of ISM’s manufacturing survey committee, noted, “Demand eased, production stabilized, and destaffing continued as panelists’ companies experience the first operational shock of the new administration’s tariff policy.”Wall Street had anticipated that Trump might use the tariffs as leverage for negotiations rather than enforcing them. However, the decision to proceed unsettled investors already wary of economic uncertainties.“Markets were looking for another 11th-hour deal to further delay tariffs, but aren’t going to get one this time,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. “The next phase is to endure them. Markets have to price that reality, and those numbers are painted red.”James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management, echoed the concerns: “It’s just more of a continuation of a string of bad economic news that tends to put a little bit of a dampener on the optimism we saw from fourth-quarter earnings.”Certain sectors and stocks were hit particularly hard. Nvidia fell 8.8%, and Tesla slipped 2.8%. Retail giant Kroger dropped 3% after its Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an internal investigation into his personal conduct.Even stocks connected to cryptocurrency took a hit. MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy, slid 1.8%, while Coinbase dropped 4.6% despite Trump’s weekend announcement that his administration was moving forward with a crypto strategic reserve.The effects of Trump’s trade policies are being felt worldwide. In China, manufacturers reported an increase in orders in February as buyers rushed to secure goods ahead of higher US tariffs. Trump’s 10% tariff on Chinese imports is set to rise to 20% on Tuesday, and the administration has also ended the “de minimis” loophole that exempted imports worth less than $800 from tariffs.European markets, in contrast, performed better. Germany’s DAX surged 2.6%, and France’s CAC 40 rose 1.1% following a report that showed inflation was easing in February. This bolstered expectations that the European Central Bank may cut interest rates later this week. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, bubble tea chain Mixue Bingcheng soared 43% in its market debut, boosting the Hang Seng index by 0.3%.Investors will be closely watching upcoming economic reports and Federal Reserve signals. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.16% from 4.24% before the manufacturing report’s release, reflecting concerns about a slowing economy. Typically, falling Treasury yields can boost stocks, but this time the decline is driven by fears of a broader economic downturn.With inflation worries still present, the Federal Reserve may have limited room to cut interest rates to stimulate growth. Market expectations currently point to at least two 25-basis-point rate cuts by the end of the year, but economic conditions could force a reassessment of that outlook.(With inputs from agencies)","The S&P 500 dropped 1.8% following Trump's statement that there was ""no room left"" for negotiations to lower the tariffs, which will begin Tuesday.

The US treasury department announced Sunday that it will no longer enforce the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) and its associated Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirements.The decision effectively suspends penalties for US citizens and domestic companies, shifting enforcement efforts toward foreign businesses.The move was welcomed by US President Donald Trump. He celebrated the decision on Truth Social, calling the BOI rule ""outrageous and invasive.""He wrote, ""Exciting news! The treasury department has announced that they are suspending all enforcement of the outrageous and invasive Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirement for US citizens. This Biden rule has been an absolute disaster for small businesses nationwide. Furthermore, treasury is now finalising an emergency regulation to formally suspend this rule for American businesses. The economic menace of BOI reporting will soon be no more.""The BOI rule, introduced under the CTA, required businesses to disclose details about their owners to the treasury’s financial crimes enforcement network (FinCEN) to curb money laundering and financial crimes.However, according to Irish Star, the enforcement of these requirements had already faced multiple delays due to legal challenges.As per Fox Business, treasury secretary Scott Bessent supported Trump’s stance, calling the decision ""a victory for common sense.""He added, ""Today’s action is part of President Trump’s bold agenda to unleash American prosperity by reining in burdensome regulations, in particular for small businesses that are the backbone of the American economy.""The treasury department also confirmed on X that “penalties or fines associated with BOI will not be enforced,” and clarified that the agency will issue a new proposed rule to limit the reporting requirement to foreign companies only.The CTA, which was signed into law in January 2021, was initially set to take effect in January 2024 but repeated federal court rulings delayed its implementation. The law aimed to increase financial transparency by making it harder for criminals to use shell companies for illicit activities such as money laundering and drug trafficking.Trump’s latest policy shift aligns with his broader economic agenda, which includes regulatory rollbacks and spending cuts ranging from $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion, according to Fox Business.","The US treasury department announced Sunday that it will no longer enforce the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) and its associated Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) reporting requirements.

Trump's crypto play: A game changer or just a market jolt?

Unanswered questions: How will the crypto reserve work?

US President Donald Trump shook up the cryptocurrency world on Sunday, announcing that XRP (Ripple), SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano) would be included in a newly formed US Crypto Strategic Reserve . The move sent all three assets surging between 10% and 35% in market trading, reported Reuters.Trump revealed the decision in a social media post, tying it to his January executive order on digital assets. “I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World,” he declared, adding that his directive instructed the Presidential Working Group to move forward with the reserve plan.The announcement marks a sharp policy shift from the Biden administration, which had cracked down on the crypto industry over concerns about fraud and money laundering. Trump's 2024 campaign, in contrast, won significant backing from crypto executives, and his latest move signals that he intends to deliver on his pro-crypto promises.While the news initially sparked a rally, broader cryptocurrency markets have struggled in recent weeks, with many digital assets erasing their post-election gains. Analysts believe a more sustained market boost will require either interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve or a clearer regulatory framework from the Trump administration.Despite the excitement, details about the crypto reserve remain unclear. Some experts speculate it could be funded through the US Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, which is traditionally used to manage foreign currencies. Others suggest it might involve cryptocurrencies seized in law enforcement actions.Legal scholars are divided on whether the reserve could be established without congressional approval. Meanwhile, Trump’s inner circle is pressing ahead—his family has even launched its own cryptocurrency, and the first-ever White House Crypto Summit is set for Friday.With the administration doubling down on its pro-crypto stance, all eyes are now on Washington to see whether Trump’s bold move is the start of a new financial era or just another short-lived market shake-up.","US President Donald Trump announced Sunday that XRP (Ripple), SOL (Solana), and ADA (Cardano) would be included in a newly formed US Crypto Strategic Reserve.

"Tesla sets sights on Waymo, Uber in California ride-hail bid",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-sets-sights-on-waymo-uber-in-california-ride-hail-bid/articleshow/118656189.cms,"Tesla

Different business models

Tesla Inc. is seeking approval to offer ride-hailing services in California, a key step by Elon Musk’s company to begin carrying paying customers while its traditional car-selling business falters.The electric vehicle manufacturer applied late last year for what’s known as a transportation charter-party carrier permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, according to documents viewed by Bloomberg. That classification means Tesla would own and control the fleet of vehicles.The previously unreported application suggests Tesla is working to launch a promised ride-hailing business in the near term, opening a new revenue stream and putting it in competition with the likes of Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc. and Waymo. Musk has said Tesla would roll out driverless ride-hailing in Austin in June and aimed to offer it in California by the end of the year, without offering specific details.Shares of Uber briefly turned negative on the news and were trading up less than 1% as of 12.57 p.m. in New York. Lyft also pared gains. Tesla was little changed.Musk has made a big bet on autonomous driving , robotics and artificial intelligence as the primary business of selling EVs struggles. Tesla recently posted its first annual sales decline in over a decade, and the first quarter shows signs of sluggishness in key markets such as the US and Europe.In its communications with California officials, Tesla discussed driver’s license information and drug-testing coordination, suggesting the company intends to use human drivers, at least initially. Tesla is applying for the same type of permit used by Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s robotaxi business. While Tesla has approval to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in California, it doesn’t have, nor has applied for, a driverless testing or deployment permit from the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, according to a spokesperson.It wasn’t immediately clear whether Tesla would obtain the California Public Utilities Commission permit or when the service might start. A spokesperson said in an emailed statement that Tesla’s application “is pending and not yet public.”Casey Blaine, Tesla’s senior regulatory counsel, didn’t respond to requests from Bloomberg for comment. Several other Tesla employees who are involved in the effort also didn’t respond to inquiries.A ride-hailing business with human drivers could pave the way for Tesla to introduce robotaxi service in California, where Waymo already operates a driverless fleet in San Francisco.There are different permitting requirements and operating rules for each business model — Uber and Lyft allow drivers to use their personal vehicles, unlike Waymo — and the state’s stricter demands on autonomous vehicles have tripped up some companies. Cruise had its license suspended in California after an incident that injured a pedestrian, and parent General Motors Co. later folded the operations while abandoning the robotaxi market.Musk has talked for years about operating a Tesla fleet without human drivers. Tesla does not currently have a fully autonomous vehicle on the market, but it offers driver-assistance systems that control some functions while an alert human remains behind the wheel.Tesla unveiled a prototype in October of its forthcoming driverless Cybercab. Musk has said the company will roll out its ride-hailing service initially using existing vehicle models, which would include the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV.Musk recently addressed ride-hailing preparations, saying that there was “a bunch of work that needs to be done to make sure the whole thing works efficiently,” including ensuring that the payment system and app functionality operate as intended.Tesla’s path to launching robotaxi service is clearer in Texas, where autonomous driving is regulated much like any other vehicle. Its vehicles will be required to have cameras and be able to follow traffic laws and have insurance.The company will also need a ride-share license with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. As of early February, the company had not had communication with the department, according to a records request. Tesla is also not currently listed as a ride-share licensee on the department’s website.Uber is preparing to launch autonomous rides with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta this year. Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said this month that he had had conversations with Musk, but that the Tesla CEO decided not to put its vehicles on Uber’s platform.","Elon Musk has said Tesla would roll out driverless ride-hailing in Austin in June and aimed to offer it in California by the end of the year.

Bitcoin slides from all-time high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bitcoin-slides-from-all-time-high/articleshow/118655668.cms,"Trump trade woes

A week-long rout in Bitcoin deepened amid the recent broader retreat from risky assets in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and crypto sector turmoil, marking a dramatic reality check for one of the most popular Trump trades.The original cryptocurrency tumbled as much as 7.2% to $78,226 at one point Friday, bringing its decline from the all-time high reached less than six weeks ago to 28%. Bitcoin later pared the loss, and ended up trading little changed on the day. Bitcoin fell around 18% in February, the biggest monthly drop since June 2022.“Some large players just said at the end of the day, ‘you know what, I’m just going to throw in the towel,” said Zaheer Ebtikar, co-founder of crypto fund Split Capital. “I think that’s what we saw this past week. There was definitely a lot of selling more than usual, so it’s hard to pinpoint one specific exchange or place.”This week’s drop in Bitcoin has taken it to technical levels that many traders watch for signs that the selloff may have gone too far, inspiring dip buyers to step in and at least pause the declines. Bitcoin has fallen below its 200-day moving average, a closely watched indicator of the long-term trend, for the first time since October. Its 14-day relative strength index, a gauge of price momentum, this week fell below a level indicating the asset is considered oversold for the first time since September.Trump said Thursday that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would come into force from March 4, undermining hopes he might reverse course after a previous delay. He also said Chinese imports would face a further 10% levy, prompting officials in Beijing to promise “all necessary measures” in response.The focus on trade tensions had led to a broad risk-off decline across markets on Friday, pushing down almost all Asian stock markets and fueling declines in Europe. But cryptocurrencies — which are deeply exposed to shifts in risk appetite — were among the worst hit.The selloff underscores a swift change of fortunes for what was previously one of the most popular Trump trades in global markets: buying Bitcoin on the expectation that the president’s crypto-friendly approach would lead to a broad rally.That worked for a while. Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $109,241 on Jan. 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. But cryptocurrencies have recently come under pressure amid worries that Trump’s pugilistic approach to global trade could lead to broad pain.“Given the macro environment, it’s not surprising to see we are where we are,” said Stefan von Haenisch, director of over-the-counter trading in Asia Pacific at crypto custody firm Bitgo Inc. Traders are still waiting for Trump to come up with concrete steps for the sector including a Bitcoin stockpile, he said.Investors are now being forced to consider quite how far the world’s biggest cryptocurrency can fall. There is support for the coin around $70,000, said Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at crypto platform YouHodler, pointing to technical analysis. But he said investors shouldn’t assume the rout in Bitcoin will get that bad.“We will only see this level if negative sentiment dominates the equity markets,“ said Lienkha.Bearish sentiment has also hit spot US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds . Investors have pulled a record $3.3 billion from US spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in February, poised for the biggest monthly exodus since they debuted, as investors sought refuge in safer assets amid rising geopolitical tensions and persistent inflation concerns.Trump has already made a few changes that have pleased crypto bulls, including putting crypto advocates in key positions. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which embarked on a yearslong crackdown under former Chair Gary Gensler, has also closed investigations into several crypto outfits in recent weeks.Trump has said he wants to make the US “the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world.”","The original cryptocurrency tumbled as much as 7.2% to $78,226 at one point Friday.

Many analysts believe these factors are pushing investors away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.After a strong run in the markets, sentiment took a hit this week when Trump confirmed that a 25 per cent tariff on Mexico and Canada would take effect on 4 March, with an additional 10 per cent levy on China to follow.Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $109,241 on 20 January, the day of Trump’s inauguration, but has since plunged almost 25 per cent as traders unwind bets placed on the back of his election.The sell-off gained momentum during Friday’s Asian trading session, driven by growing concerns over Trump’s aggressive trade policies and broader economic instability. His pledges to slash taxes and immigration also raised fears of renewed inflation, which could compel the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated.","The world’s largest digital asset dropped to $79,525.88 during early Asian trading on Friday.

Adding to their pain is the tightening of post-education work visa norms, which dims chances of higher pay abroad and repay loan sooner back home.In six months, the rupee has depreciated by about 5% to 87.2 against the dollar from 83.5 in Aug. That's an increase of Rs 5 lakh on a Rs 1-crore tuition-plus-expenses budget.At the same time, the UK has proposed requiring international graduates to secure graduate-level jobs with salaries between 36,000-40,000 pounds to stay beyond two years. Canada too is tightening immigration rules for Indian students, by allowing officials to cancel permits and ending the Student Direct Stream visa program.""Earlier, students used the post-education work visa to earn in dollars and repay a large part of their loans. For Indian students in undergraduate programs, the impact could be severe as their total cost of education is in excess of Rs 1.5 crore in the US,"" said Ajay Bohora, co-founder of education loan company HDFC Credila.This means either a longer repayment period or higher EMIs on their education loans , said Bohora. The weak rupee also increases costs for students flying back. According to Bohora, the higher financial burden on families will require students to be more frugal.""I am now sending $800 a month instead of $900 for my daughter's food & board in the US. Govt has, on top of that, put TCS, which is an additional burden. So, on my tax-paid money, I am paying tax for the second time via TCS. Though I can get a refund, it has blocked my tax-paid money for a year,"" said Sudha Pai, a Mumbai resident.""While fluctuations are a regular phenomenon, this year there has been a huge upward rise in the dollar. Coupled with the uncertainty caused by the political scenario in the wake of elections, the impact on overseas education has been huge,"" said K P Singh, an education counsellor & founder, Institute of Management & Foreign Studies.According to Karan Gupta, a career counsellor, parents can 'lock in' foreign exchange rates by getting a loan sanctioned early and transferring funds to the university account to hedge against depreciation. ""Students should avoid foreign currency loans, as it would be more expensive to repay when they return to India. They should also apply to universities that offer financial aid and scholarships, thereby reducing their financial burden,"" said Gupta.Bohora attributes the restrictions on student work visas to ""economic patriotism,"" which is on the rise in the US, the UK, and Canada.The US has signalled its intent to attract highly skilled global talent to drive technological innovation and economic growth. Indian students who want to pursue higher education in the US would have to explore emerging fields such as GenAI, cybersecurity, distributed finance, blockchain, and digital currencies to enhance job prospects.According to Singh, students should not focus solely on traditional fields like coding and programming but should explore new-age areas. He added that those without the financial resources should not take risks by pursuing courses with limited employment potential.","In six months, the rupee has depreciated by about 5% to 87.2 against the dollar from 83.5 in Aug.

Sahil Bloom with family

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

In a semi-kayfabe culture of productivity hacks and KPIs, Sahil Bloom has some real insights. The investor, entrepreneur, and author sits across from me in his office, occasionally glancing at what I imagine is a meticulously structured calendar. His recent book, “The 5 Types of Wealth,” has been gaining traction not just in business circles but among a broader audience seeking a more comprehensive approach to success.“Money is an enabler, not a goal,” Bloom states with conviction early in our conversation. It's a sentiment that might sound trite coming from someone else, but Bloom's background in finance and investing lends the observation a certain gravitas. “What gets measured gets managed,” he continues, referencing Peter Drucker . “Money's measurability means that for most people, that's the only thing they focus on and optimize around.”This observation forms one pillar of Bloom's philosophy: We've been measuring the wrong things. Through his research and conversations with successful individuals, Bloom identified four recurring themes that contribute to a fulfilling life: time, people, purpose, and health. The financial component, while important, serves primarily as an enabler rather than an end in itself.“A big part of the book, and the entire idea, is that we need to measure the bigger picture of what really matters in building a fulfilling life,” he explains. “These other things in addition to money. Money is not nothing. It simply can't be the only thing.”When pressed about the three most important decisions that shape our lives—where to live, who to be with romantically, and what to do professionally—Bloom resists offering prescriptive advice. “It's very hard for me to tell you what you should care about.” Instead, he emphasizes the meta-perspective: creating space to ask these questions in the first place. “You need to stop and pause and create the space necessary to come to your own answers for them,” he insists. “That is what's important. It's not someone telling you 'here are the answers.' It's that you are given and allowed and pushed to create the space to ask them in the first place.”This approach reflects Bloom's belief that self-awareness is paramount in decision-making. But how does one distinguish between authentic desires and mimetic ones—those we've absorbed from our environment? Bloom references a conversation with his friend Derek Thompson , a writer at The Atlantic: “Do you want the job, or do you want other people to see you have this job?”He elaborates: “Would you take that job or buy that thing if no one else in the world would figure out or find out that you had it? Would you still want to do it? That's a really good way of cutting through the noise.”I also asked Bloom about the evergreen skills that will remain valuable regardless of technological advances. His answer is immediate and confident.“I think the two skills that will continue to matter no matter what are storytelling and sales,” he says. “Storytelling and sales are fundamentally everything when it comes to your life. The CEOs of the biggest companies in the world are not the smartest people at their organizations. They are the best storytellers.”This perspective challenges conventional thinking about technical expertise. “Ten years ago, you would have said software engineering is such a durable skill. Well, I could create a case where software engineering is a totally obsolete skill because of AI in ten years,” Bloom observes. “What that means is that the meta-skills are what really matter.”But how does one become a good storyteller? Per Bloom, it's about deliberate practice and acute observation. “Every single time I talk about anything, I am paying attention to the things that are making your eyes light up. I'm paying attention to the things that are making you lean in. I'm paying attention to the things where you look confused,” he explains. “Every single time you are telling your story, you should be gathering information and data to make your story even better the next time you do it.”Perhaps the most striking aspect of my conversation with Bloom is his unwavering commitment to delayed gratification. In an era of instant validation, though, his approach seems almost ancient (and wise).“I fundamentally believe that delayed gratification is the key to life,” he states with remarkable certainty. “Delayed gratification is effectively the cheat code that allows you to build the life that you want.”This philosophy manifests in his daily routine and work ethic. “If all I have to do to provide for my family is wake up at 4am every single day, I have to be able to get myself up and do that,"" he says, his voice taking on an edge of intensity. “It doesn't matter how I feel, because if I followed how it felt on a daily basis, I would never get started on anything.”This willingness to override short-term discomfort for long-term gain permeates Bloom's thinking about relationships as well. “Marriage is sacrificing short-term freedom in order to achieve long-term freedom of a fulfilling, happy life,” he observes. “That is really the fundamental trade-off that we constantly come into tension with.”In between our discussion on productivity and discipline, Bloom endorses boredom. In our hyper-stimulated world, he sees deliberate periods of non-stimulation as essential.“Create space to retreat, to pause, to create solitude for yourself,” he advises. “This is like the hidden life hack that no one talks about—that you need to have a boredom ritual in your life.”Bloom cites Pascal: “Blaise Pascal said all of humanity's problems come from the inability to sit in a room alone, and that's very true.” For Bloom, these periods of boredom aren't extensive—""probably like 15 minutes a day of true boredom”—but they're non-negotiable. “It's very uncomfortable when you first do it because you're so unused to zero stimulation. The only time you ever have zero stimulation is when you're in the shower, and it's no wonder that you have your best ideas there.”This approach to intentional boredom connects to his journaling practice, which again reflects Bloom's pragmatic nature. Rather than lengthy introspection, he employs what he calls the “1-1-1 method”: “Three minutes, and you write down one win from the day, something you feel good about; one point of stress or tension, something you're stressed about; and then one point of gratitude, something that you were grateful for during the day. Takes literally two to three minutes, and you never have an excuse to not do it.”The primary benefit? Better sleep. “I fall asleep much more quickly. I feel way less anxious when I get into bed because I got that thing off my brain and onto the paper.”Bloom also offers a perspective on relationships that aligns with his long-term thinking. “I approach every single new relationship with a question: If I were to assume that I am going to know this person for the next 50 years, how would I approach this relationship, this first meeting?”The answer reflects his non-transactional philosophy: “I wouldn't ask for anything, for sure. I would probably just try to really understand a person and start to go deep and understand who this person is, what their motivations are, what they're all about. People that approach life quid pro quo and approach things in a transactional way very rarely achieve the best outcomes in life.”His approach to maintaining relationships is similarly intuitive rather than systematic. “I don't have a CRM. I just do everything off of feel. When I think something about someone, I just send them the text, and I do it right then, because I think that inspiration around relationships is very perishable.”As our time draws to a close, I ask Bloom what people most commonly misunderstand about building a fulfilling life. His answer crystallizes the philosophy that underpins his book and worldview.“The single biggest mindset shift people need to have is to recognize that investments in all of these areas of your life compound in the same way as financial investments,” he says with particular emphasis. “We don't think that way. We don't think about investments in relationships compounding. We don't think about investments in our health or in our purpose as compounding, but they do.”This insight leads to the final one: “Anything above zero compounds. Doing a tiny bit today—sending the one text, going for the 15-minute walk—all of those things are better than doing nothing. Anything above zero compounds. That mindset will change your life.”In a world fragmented by competing metrics and definitions of success, Bloom’s approach suggests that fulfillment may lie not in the grand gestures but in small, consistent actions across multiple dimensions of wealth—actions whose value, like compound interest, becomes apparent only with the passage of time.","Sahil Bloom is an investor, entrepreneur, and author.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"
